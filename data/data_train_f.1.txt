Robert Cohn was once middleweight boxing champion of Princeton.
Do not think that I am very much impressed by that as a boxing title, but it meant a lot to Cohn.
He cared nothing for boxing, in fact he disliked it, but he learned it painfully and thoroughly to counteract the feeling of inferiority and shyness he had felt on being treated as a Jew at Princeton.
There was a certain inner comfort in knowing he could knock down anybody who was snooty to him, although, being very shy and a thoroughly nice boy, he never fought except in the gym.
He was Spider Kelly's star pupil.
Spider Kelly taught all his young gentlemen to box like featherweights, no matter whether they weighed one hundred and five or two hundred and five pounds.
But it seemed to fit Cohn.
He was really very fast.
He was so good that Spider promptly overmatched him and got his nose permanently flattened.
This increased Cohn's distaste for boxing, but it gave him a certain satisfaction of some strange sort, and it certainly improved his nose.
In his last year at Princeton he read too much and took to wearing spectacles.
I never met any one of his class who remembered him.
They did not even remember that he was middleweight boxing champion.
I mistrust all frank and simple people, especially when their stories hold together, and I always had a suspicion that perhaps Robert Cohn had never been middleweight boxing champion, and that perhaps a horse had stepped on his face, or that maybe his mother had been frightened or seen something, or that he had, maybe, bumped into something as a young child, but I finally had somebody verify the story from Spider Kelly.
Spider Kelly not only remembered Cohn.
He had often wondered what had become of him.
Robert Cohn was a member, through his father, of one of the richest Jewish families in New York, and through his mother of one of the oldest.
At the military school where he prepped for Princeton, and played a very good end on the football team, no one had made him race-conscious.
No one had ever made him feel he was a Jew, and hence any different from anybody else, until he went to Princeton.
He was a nice boy, a friendly boy, and very shy, and it made him bitter.
He took it out in boxing, and he came out of Princeton with painful self-consciousness and the flattened nose, and was married by the first girl who was nice to him.
He was married five years, had three children, lost most of the fifty thousand dollars his father left him, the balance of the estate having gone to his mother, hardened into a rather unattractive mould under domestic unhappiness with a rich wife; and just when he had made up his mind to leave his wife she left him and went off with a miniature-painter.
As he had been thinking for months about leaving his wife and had not done it because it would be too cruel to deprive her of himself, her departure was a very healthful shock.
The divorce was arranged and Robert Cohn went out to the Coast.
In California he fell among literary people and, as he still had a little of the fifty thousand left, in a short time he was backing a review of the Arts.
The review commenced publication in Carmel, California, and finished in Provincetown, Massachusetts.
By that time Cohn, who had been regarded purely as an angel, and whose name had appeared on the editorial page merely as a member of the advisory board, had become the sole editor.
It was his money and he discovered he liked the authority of editing.
He was sorry when the magazine became too expensive and he had to give it up.
By that time, though, he had other things to worry about.
He had been taken in hand by a lady who hoped to rise with the magazine.
She was very forceful, and Cohn never had a chance of not being taken in hand.
Also he was sure that he loved her.
When this lady saw that the magazine was not going to rise, she became a little disgusted with Cohn and decided that she might as well get what there was to get while there was still something available, so she urged that they go to Europe, where Cohn could write.
They came to Europe, where the lady had been educated, and stayed three years.
During these three years, the first spent in travel, the last two in Paris, Robert Cohn had two friends, Braddocks and myself.
Braddocks was his literary friend.
I was his tennis friend.
The lady who had him, her name was Frances, found toward the end of the second year that her looks were going, and her attitude toward Robert changed from one of careless possession and exploitation to the absolute determination that he should marry her.
During this time Robert's mother had settled an allowance on him, about three hundred dollars a month.
During two years and a half I do not believe that Robert Cohn looked at another woman.
He was fairly happy, except that, like many people living in Europe, he would rather have been in America, and he had discovered writing.
He wrote a novel, and it was not really such a bad novel as the critics later called it, although it was a very poor novel.
He read many books, played bridge, played tennis, and boxed at a local gymnasium.
I first became aware of his lady's attitude toward him one night after the three of us had dined together.
We had dined at l'Avenue's and afterward went to the Café de Versailles for coffee.
We had several fines after the coffee, and I said I must be going.
Cohn had been talking about the two of us going off somewhere on a weekend trip.
He wanted to get out of town and get in a good walk.
I suggested we fly to Strasbourg and walk up to Saint Odile, or somewhere or other in Alsace.
"I know a girl in Strasbourg who can show us the town," I said.
Somebody kicked me under the table.
I thought it was accidental and went on: "She's been there two years and knows everything there is to know about the town.
She's a swell girl.
I was kicked again under the table and, looking, saw Frances, Robert's lady, her chin lifting and her face hardening.
"Hell," I said, "why go to Strasbourg? We could go up to Bruges, or to the Ardennes."
Cohn looked relieved.
I was not kicked again.
I said good-night and went out.
Cohn said he wanted to buy a paper and would walk to the corner with me.
"For God's sake," he said, "why did you say that about that girl in Strasbourg for? Didn't you see Frances?".
"No, why should I? If I know an American girl that lives in Strasbourg what the hell is it to Frances?"
"It doesn't make any difference. Any girl. I couldn't go, that would be all."
"Don't be silly."
"You don't know Frances. Any girl at all. Didn't you see the way she looked?"
"Oh, well," I said, "let's go to Senlis."
"Don't get sore."
"I'm not sore. Senlis is a good place and we can stay at the Grand Cerf and take a hike in the woods and come home."
"Good, that will be fine."
"Well, I'll see you to-morrow at the courts," I said.
"Good-night, Jake," he said, and started back to the café.
"You forgot to get your paper," I said.
"That's so." He walked with me up to the kiosque at the corner. "You are not sore, are you, Jake?" He turned with the paper in his hand.
"No, why should I be?"
"See you at tennis," he said. I watched him walk back to the café holding his paper. I rather liked him and evidently she led him quite a life.
That winter Robert Cohn went over to America with his novel, and it was accepted by a fairly good publisher.
His going made an awful row I heard, and I think that was where Frances lost him, because several women were nice to him in New York, and when he came back he was quite changed.
He was more enthusiastic about America than ever, and he was not so simple, and he was not so nice.
The publishers had praised his novel pretty highly and it rather went to his head.
Then several women had put themselves out to be nice to him, and his horizons had all shifted.
For four years his horizon had been absolutely limited to his wife.
For three years, or almost three years, he had never seen beyond Frances.
I am sure he had never been in love in his life.
He had married on the rebound from the rotten time he had in college, and Frances took him on the rebound from his discovery that he had not been everything to his first wife.
He was not in love yet but he realized that he was an attractive quantity to women, and that the fact of a woman caring for him and wanting to live with him was not simply a divine miracle.
This changed him so that he was not so pleasant to have around.
Also, playing for higher stakes than he could afford in some rather steep bridge games with his New York connections, he had held cards and won several hundred dollars.
It made him rather vain of his bridge game, and he talked several times of how a man could always make a living at bridge if he were ever forced to.
Then there was another thing.
He had been reading W.
Hudson.
That sounds like an innocent occupation, but Cohn had read and reread "The Purple Land.
" "The Purple Land" is a very sinister book if read too late in life.
It recounts splendid imaginary amorous adventures of a perfect English gentleman in an intensely romantic land, the scenery of which is very well described.
For a man to take it at thirty-four as a guide-book to what life holds is about as safe as it would be for a man of the same age to enter Wall Street direct from a French convent, equipped with a complete set of the more practical Alger books.
Cohn, I believe, took every word of "The Purple Land" as literally as though it had been an R.
Dun report.
You understand me, he made some reservations, but on the whole the book to him was sound.
It was all that was needed to set him off.
I did not realize the extent to which it had set him off until one day he came into my office.
"Hello, Robert," I said. "Did you come in to cheer me up?"
"Would you like to go to South America, Jake?" he asked.
"No."
"Why not?"
"I don't know. I never wanted to go. Too expensive. You can see all the South Americans you want in Paris anyway."
"They're not the real South Americans."
"They look awfully real to me."
I had a boat train to catch with a week's mail stories, and only half of them written.
"Do you know any dirt?" I asked.
"No."
"None of your exalted connections getting divorces?"
"No; listen, Jake. If I handled both our expenses, would you go to South America with me?"
"Why me?"
"You can talk Spanish. And it would be more fun with two of us."
"No," I said, "I like this town and I go to Spain in the summer-time."
"All my life I've wanted to go on a trip like that," Cohn said. He sat down. "I'll be too old before I can ever do it."
"Don't be a fool," I said. "You can go anywhere you want. You've got plenty of money."
"I know. But I can't get started."
"Cheer up," I said. "All countries look just like the moving pictures."
But I felt sorry for him.
He had it badly.
"I can't stand it to think my life is going so fast and I'm not really living it."
"Nobody ever lives their life all the way up except bull-fighters."
"I'm not interested in bull-fighters. That's an abnormal life. I want to go back in the country in South America. We could have a great trip."
"Did you ever think about going to British East Africa to shoot?"
"No, I wouldn't like that."
"I'd go there with you."
"No; that doesn't interest me."
"That's because you never read a book about it. Go on and read a book all full of love affairs with the beautiful shiny black princesses."
"I want to go to South America."
He had a hard, Jewish, stubborn streak.
"Come on down-stairs and have a drink."
"Aren't you working?"
"No," I said. We went down the stairs to the café on the ground floor. I had discovered that was the best way to get rid of friends. Once you had a drink all you had to say was: "Well, I've got to get back and get off some cables," and it was done. It is very important to discover graceful exits like that in the newspaper business, where it is such an important part of the ethics that you should never seem to be working. Anyway, we went down-stairs to the bar and had a whiskey and soda. Cohn looked at the bottles in bins around the wall. "This is a good place," he said.
"There's a lot of liquor," I agreed.
"Listen, Jake," he leaned forward on the bar. "Don't you ever get the feeling that all your life is going by and you're not taking advantage of it? Do you realize you've lived nearly half the time you have to live already?"
"Yes, every once in a while."
"Do you know that in about thirty-five years more we'll be dead?"
"What the hell, Robert," I said. "What the hell."
"I'm serious."
"It's one thing I don't worry about," I said.
"You ought to."
"I've had plenty to worry about one time or other. I'm through worrying."
"Well, I want to go to South America."
"Listen, Robert, going to another country doesn't make any difference. I've tried all that. You can't get away from yourself by moving from one place to another. There's nothing to that."
"But you've never been to South America."
"South America hell! If you went there the way you feel now it would be exactly the same. This is a good town. Why don't you start living your life in Paris?"
"I'm sick of Paris, and I'm sick of the Quarter."
"Stay away from the Quarter. Cruise around by yourself and see what happens to you."
"Nothing happens to me. I walked alone all one night and nothing happened except a bicycle cop stopped me and asked to see my papers."
"Wasn't the town nice at night?"
"I don't care for Paris."
So there you were.
I was sorry for him, but it was not a thing you could do anything about, because right away you ran up against the two stubbornnesses: South America could fix it and he did not like Paris.
He got the first idea out of a book, and I suppose the second came out of a book too.
"Well," I said, "I've got to go up-stairs and get off some cables."
"Do you really have to go?"
"Yes, I've got to get these cables off."
"Do you mind if I come up and sit around the office?"
"No, come on up."
He sat in the outer room and read the papers, and the Editor and Publisher and I worked hard for two hours.
Then I sorted out the carbons, stamped on a by-line, put the stuff in a couple of big manila envelopes and rang for a boy to take them to the Gare St.
Lazare.
I went out into the other room and there was Robert Cohn asleep in the big chair.
He was asleep with his head on his arms.
I did not like to wake him up, but I wanted to lock the office and shove off.
I put my hand on his shoulder.
He shook his head.
"I can't do it," he said, and put his head deeper into his arms.
"I can't do it.
Nothing will make me do it.
"Robert," I said, and shook him by the shoulder. He looked up. He smiled and blinked.
"Did I talk out loud just then?"
"Something. But it wasn't clear."
"God, what a rotten dream!"
"Did the typewriter put you to sleep?"
"Guess so. I didn't sleep all last night."
"What was the matter?"
"Talking," he said.
I could picture it.
I have a rotten habit of picturing the bedroom scenes of my friends.
We went out to the Café Napolitain to have an apéritif and watch the evening crowd on the Boulevard.
It was a warm spring night and I sat at a table on the terrace of the Napolitain after Robert had gone, watching it get dark and the electric signs come on, and the red and green stop-and-go traffic-signal, and the crowd going by, and the horse-cabs clippety-clopping along at the edge of the solid taxi traffic, and the poules going by, singly and in pairs, looking for the evening meal.
I watched a good-looking girl walk past the table and watched her go up the street and lost sight of her, and watched another, and then saw the first one coming back again.
She went by once more and I caught her eye, and she came over and sat down at the table.
The waiter came up.
"Well, what will you drink?" I asked.
"Pernod."
"That's not good for little girls."
"Little girl yourself. Dites garçon, un pernod."
"A pernod for me, too."
"What's the matter?" she asked. "Going on a party?"
"Sure. Aren't you?"
"I don't know. You never know in this town."
"Don't you like Paris?"
"No."
"Why don't you go somewhere else?"
"Isn't anywhere else."
"You're happy, all right."
"Happy, hell!"
Pernod is greenish imitation absinthe.
When you add water it turns milky.
It tastes like licorice and it has a good uplift, but it drops you just as far.
We sat and drank it, and the girl looked sullen.
"Well," I said, "are you going to buy me a dinner?"
She grinned and I saw why she made a point of not laughing.
With her mouth closed she was a rather pretty girl.
I paid for the saucers and we walked out to the street.
I hailed a horse-cab and the driver pulled up at the curb.
Settled back in the slow, smoothly rolling fiacre we moved up the Avenue de l'Opéra, passed the locked doors of the shops, their windows lighted, the Avenue broad and shiny and almost deserted.
The cab passed the New York Herald bureau with the window full of clocks.
"What are all the clocks for?" she asked.
"They show the hour all over America."
"Don't kid me."
We turned off the Avenue up the Rue des Pyramides, through the traffic of the Rue de Rivoli, and through a dark gate into the Tuileries.
She cuddled against me and I put my arm around her.
She looked up to be kissed.
She touched me with one hand and I put her hand away.
"Never mind."
"What's the matter? You sick?"
"Yes."
"Everybody's sick. I'm sick, too."
We came out of the Tuileries into the light and crossed the Seine and then turned up the Rue des Saints Pères.
"You oughtn't to drink pernod if you're sick."
"You neither."
"It doesn't make any difference with me. It doesn't make any difference with a woman."
"What are you called?"
"Georgette. How are you called?"
"Jacob."
"That's a Flemish name."
"American too."
"You're not Flamand?"
"No, American."
"Good, I detest Flamands."
By this time we were at the restaurant.
I called to the cocher to stop.
We got out and Georgette did not like the looks of the place.
"This is no great thing of a restaurant.
"No," I said. "Maybe you would rather go to Foyot's. Why don't you keep the cab and go on?"
I had picked her up because of a vague sentimental idea that it would be nice to eat with some one.
It was a long time since I had dined with a poule, and I had forgotten how dull it could be.
We went into the restaurant, passed Madame Lavigne at the desk and into a little room.
Georgette cheered up a little under the food.
"It isn't bad here," she said. "It isn't chic, but the food is all right."
"Better than you eat in Liège."
"Brussels, you mean."
We had another bottle of wine and Georgette made a joke.
She smiled and showed all her bad teeth, and we touched glasses.
"You're not a bad type," she said.
"It's a shame you're sick.
We get on well.
What's the matter with you, anyway?".
"I got hurt in the war," I said.
"Oh, that dirty war."
We would probably have gone on and discussed the war and agreed that it was in reality a calamity for civilization, and perhaps would have been better avoided.
I was bored enough.
Just then from the other room some one called: "Barnes! I say, Barnes! Jacob Barnes!".
"It's a friend calling me," I explained, and went out.
There was Braddocks at a big table with a party: Cohn, Frances Clyne, Mrs.
Braddocks, several people I did not know.
"You're coming to the dance, aren't you?" Braddocks asked.
"What dance?"
"Why, the dancings. Don't you know we've revived them?" Mrs. Braddocks put in.
"You must come, Jake. We're all going," Frances said from the end of the table. She was tall and had a smile.
"Of course, he's coming," Braddocks said. "Come in and have coffee with us, Barnes."
"Right."
"And bring your friend," said Mrs. Braddocks laughing. She was a Canadian and had all their easy social graces.
"Thanks, we'll be in," I said. I went back to the small room.
"Who are your friends?" Georgette asked.
"Writers and artists."
"There are lots of those on this side of the river."
"Too many."
"I think so. Still, some of them make money."
"Oh, yes."
We finished the meal and the wine.
"Come on," I said.
"We're going to have coffee with the others.
Georgette opened her bag, made a few passes at her face as she looked in the little mirror, re-defined her lips with the lipstick, and straightened her hat.
"Good," she said.
We went into the room full of people and Braddocks and the men at his table stood up.
"I wish to present my fiancée, Mademoiselle Georgette Leblanc," I said. Georgette smiled that wonderful smile, and we shook hands all round.
"Are you related to Georgette Leblanc, the singer?" Mrs. Braddocks asked.
"Connais pas," Georgette answered.
"But you have the same name," Mrs. Braddocks insisted cordially.
"No," said Georgette. "Not at all. My name is Hobin."
"But Mr. Barnes introduced you as Mademoiselle Georgette Leblanc. Surely he did," insisted Mrs. Braddocks, who in the excitement of talking French was liable to have no idea what she was saying.
"He's a fool," Georgette said.
"Oh, it was a joke, then," Mrs. Braddocks said.
"Yes," said Georgette. "To laugh at."
"Did you hear that, Henry?" Mrs. Braddocks called down the table to Braddocks. "Mr. Barnes introduced his fiancée as Mademoiselle Leblanc, and her name is actually Hobin."
"Of course, darling. Mademoiselle Hobin, I've known her for a very long time."
"Oh, Mademoiselle Hobin," Frances Clyne called, speaking French very rapidly and not seeming so proud and astonished as Mrs. Braddocks at its coming out really French. "Have you been in Paris long? Do you like it here? You love Paris, do you not?"
"Who's she?" Georgette turned to me. "Do I have to talk to her?"
She turned to Frances, sitting smiling, her hands folded, her head poised on her long neck, her lips pursed ready to start talking again.
"No, I don't like Paris. It's expensive and dirty."
"Really? I find it so extraordinarily clean. One of the cleanest cities in all Europe."
"I find it dirty."
"How strange! But perhaps you have not been here very long."
"I've been here long enough."
"But it does have nice people in it. One must grant that."
Georgette turned to me.
"You have nice friends.
Frances was a little drunk and would have liked to have kept it up but the coffee came, and Lavigne with the liqueurs, and after that we all went out and started for Braddocks's dancing-club.
The dancing-club was a bal musette in the Rue de la Montagne Sainte Geneviève.
Five nights a week the working people of the Pantheon quarter danced there.
One night a week it was the dancing-club.
On Monday nights it was closed.
When we arrived it was quite empty, except for a policeman sitting near the door, the wife of the proprietor back of the zinc bar, and the proprietor himself.
The daughter of the house came downstairs as we went in.
There were long benches, and tables ran across the room, and at the far end a dancing-floor.
"I wish people would come earlier," Braddocks said. The daughter came up and wanted to know what we would drink. The proprietor got up on a high stool beside the dancing-floor and began to play the accordion. He had a string of bells around one of his ankles and beat time with his foot as he played. Every one danced. It was hot and we came off the floor perspiring.
"My God," Georgette said. "What a box to sweat in!"
"It's hot."
"Hot, my God!"
"Take off your hat."
"That's a good idea."
Some one asked Georgette to dance, and I went over to the bar.
It was really very hot and the accordion music was pleasant in the hot night.
I drank a beer, standing in the doorway and getting the cool breath of wind from the street.
Two taxis were coming down the steep street.
They both stopped in front of the Bal.
A crowd of young men, some in jerseys and some in their shirt-sleeves, got out.
I could see their hands and newly washed, wavy hair in the light from the door.
The policeman standing by the door looked at me and smiled.
They came in.
As they went in, under the light I saw white hands, wavy hair, white faces, grimacing, gesturing, talking.
With them was Brett.
She looked very lovely and she was very much with them.
One of them saw Georgette and said: "I do declare.
There is an actual harlot.
I'm going to dance with her, Lett.
You watch me.
The tall dark one, called Lett, said: "Don't you be rash.
The wavy blond one answered: "Don't you worry, dear.
" And with them was Brett.
I was very angry.
Somehow they always made me angry.
I know they are supposed to be amusing, and you should be tolerant, but I wanted to swing on one, any one, anything to shatter that superior, simpering composure.
Instead, I walked down the street and had a beer at the bar at the next Bal.
The beer was not good and I had a worse cognac to take the taste out of my mouth.
When I came back to the Bal there was a crowd on the floor and Georgette was dancing with the tall blond youth, who danced big-hippily, carrying his head on one side, his eyes lifted as he danced.
As soon as the music stopped another one of them asked her to dance.
She had been taken up by them.
I knew then that they would all dance with her.
They are like that.
I sat down at a table.
Cohn was sitting there.
Frances was dancing.
Mrs.
Braddocks brought up somebody and introduced him as Robert Prentiss.
He was from New York by way of Chicago, and was a rising new novelist.
He had some sort of an English accent.
I asked him to have a drink.
"Thanks so much," he said, "I've just had one."
"Have another."
"Thanks, I will then."
We got the daughter of the house over and each had a fine à l'eau.
"You're from Kansas City, they tell me," he said.
"Yes."
"Do you find Paris amusing?"
"Yes."
"Really?"
I was a little drunk.
Not drunk in any positive sense but just enough to be careless.
"For God's sake," I said, "yes. Don't you?"
"Oh, how charmingly you get angry," he said. "I wish I had that faculty."
I got up and walked over toward the dancing-floor.
Mrs.
Braddocks followed me.
"Don't be cross with Robert," she said.
"He's still only a child, you know.
"I wasn't cross," I said. "I just thought perhaps I was going to throw up."
"Your fiancée is having a great success," Mrs. Braddocks looked out on the floor where Georgette was dancing in the arms of the tall, dark one, called Lett.
"Isn't she?" I said.
"Rather," said Mrs. Braddocks.
Cohn came up.
"Come on, Jake," he said, "have a drink.
" We walked over to the bar.
"What's the matter with you? You seem all worked up over something?".
"Nothing. This whole show makes me sick is all."
Brett came up to the bar.
"Hello, you chaps."
"Hello, Brett," I said. "Why aren't you tight?"
"Never going to get tight any more. I say, give a chap a brandy and soda."
She stood holding the glass and I saw Robert Cohn looking at her.
He looked a great deal as his compatriot must have looked when he saw the promised land.
Cohn, of course, was much younger.
But he had that look of eager, deserving expectation.
Brett was damned good-looking.
She wore a slipover jersey sweater and a tweed skirt, and her hair was brushed back like a boy's.
She started all that.
She was built with curves like the hull of a racing yacht, and you missed none of it with that wool jersey.
"It's a fine crowd you're with, Brett," I said.
"Aren't they lovely? And you, my dear. Where did you get it?"
"At the Napolitain."
"And have you had a lovely evening?"
"Oh, priceless," I said.
Brett laughed.
"It's wrong of you, Jake.
It's an insult to all of us.
Look at Frances there, and Jo.
This for Cohn's benefit.
"It's in restraint of trade," Brett said. She laughed again.
"You're wonderfully sober," I said.
"Yes. Aren't I? And when one's with the crowd I'm with, one can drink in such safety, too."
The music started and Robert Cohn said: "Will you dance this with me, Lady Brett?".
Brett smiled at him.
"I've promised to dance this with Jacob," she laughed.
"You've a hell of a biblical name, Jake.
"How about the next?" asked Cohn.
"We're going," Brett said. "We've a date up at Montmartre." Dancing, I looked over Brett's shoulder and saw Cohn, standing at the bar, still watching her.
"You've made a new one there," I said to her.
"Don't talk about it. Poor chap. I never knew it till just now."
"Oh, well," I said. "I suppose you like to add them up."
"Don't talk like a fool."
"You do."
"Oh, well. What if I do?"
"Nothing," I said. We were dancing to the accordion and some one was playing the banjo. It was hot and I felt happy. We passed close to Georgette dancing with another one of them.
"What possessed you to bring her?"
"I don't know, I just brought her."
"You're getting damned romantic."
"No, bored."
"Now?"
"No, not now."
"Let's get out of here. She's well taken care of."
"Do you want to?"
"Would I ask you if I didn't want to?"
We left the floor and I took my coat off a hanger on the wall and put it on.
Brett stood by the bar.
Cohn was talking to her.
I stopped at the bar and asked them for an envelope.
The patronne found one.
I took a fifty-franc note from my pocket, put it in the envelope, sealed it, and handed it to the patronne.
"If the girl I came with asks for me, will you give her this?" I said. "If she goes out with one of those gentlemen, will you save this for me?"
"C'est entendu, Monsieur," the patronne said. "You go now? So early?"
"Yes," I said.
We started out the door.
Cohn was still talking to Brett.
She said good night and took my arm.
"Good night, Cohn," I said.
Outside in the street we looked for a taxi.
"You're going to lose your fifty francs," Brett said.
"Oh, yes."
"No taxis."
"We could walk up to the Pantheon and get one."
"Come on and we'll get a drink in the pub next door and send for one."
"You wouldn't walk across the street."
"Not if I could help it."
We went into the next bar and I sent a waiter for a taxi.
"Well," I said, "we're out away from them."
We stood against the tall zinc bar and did not talk and looked at each other.
The waiter came and said the taxi was outside.
Brett pressed my hand hard.
I gave the waiter a franc and we went out.
"Where should I tell him?" I asked.
"Oh, tell him to drive around."
I told the driver to go to the Parc Montsouris, and got in, and slammed the door.
Brett was leaning back in the corner, her eyes closed.
I got in and sat beside her.
The cab started with a jerk.
"Oh, darling, I've been so miserable," Brett said.
The taxi went up the hill, passed the lighted square, then on into the dark, still climbing, then levelled out onto a dark street behind St.
Etienne du Mont, went smoothly down the asphalt, passed the trees and the standing bus at the Place de la Contrescarpe, then turned onto the cobbles of the Rue Mouffetard.
There were lighted bars and late open shops on each side of the street.
We were sitting apart and we jolted close together going down the old street.
Brett's hat was off.
Her head was back.
I saw her face in the lights from the open shops, then it was dark, then I saw her face clearly as we came out on the Avenue des Gobelins.
The street was torn up and men were working on the car-tracks by the light of acetylene flares.
Brett's face was white and the long line of her neck showed in the bright light of the flares.
The street was dark again and I kissed her.
Our lips were tight together and then she turned away and pressed against the corner of the seat, as far away as she could get.
Her head was down.
"Don't touch me," she said. "Please don't touch me."
"What's the matter?"
"I can't stand it."
"Oh, Brett."
"You mustn't. You must know. I can't stand it, that's all. Oh, darling, please understand!"
"Don't you love me?"
"Love you? I simply turn all to jelly when you touch me."
"Isn't there anything we can do about it?"
She was sitting up now.
My arm was around her and she was leaning back against me, and we were quite calm.
She was looking into my eyes with that way she had of looking that made you wonder whether she really saw out of her own eyes.
They would look on and on after every one else's eyes in the world would have stopped looking.
She looked as though there were nothing on earth she would not look at like that, and really she was afraid of so many things.
"And there's not a damn thing we could do," I said.
"I don't know," she said. "I don't want to go through that hell again."
"We'd better keep away from each other."
"But, darling, I have to see you. It isn't all that you know."
"No, but it always gets to be."
"That's my fault. Don't we pay for all the things we do, though?"
She had been looking into my eyes all the time.
Her eyes had different depths, sometimes they seemed perfectly flat.
Now you could see all the way into them.
"When I think of the hell I've put chaps through. I'm paying for it all now."
"Don't talk like a fool," I said. "Besides, what happened to me is supposed to be funny. I never think about it."
"Oh, no. I'll lay you don't."
"Well, let's shut up about it."
"I laughed about it too, myself, once." She wasn't looking at me. "A friend of my brother's came home that way from Mons. It seemed like a hell of a joke. Chaps never know anything, do they?"
"No," I said. "Nobody ever knows anything."
I was pretty well through with the subject.
At one time or another I had probably considered it from most of its various angles, including the one that certain injuries or imperfections are a subject of merriment while remaining quite serious for the person possessing them.
"It's funny," I said. "It's very funny. And it's a lot of fun, too, to be in love."
"Do you think so?" her eyes looked flat again.
"I don't mean fun that way. In a way it's an enjoyable feeling."
"No," she said. "I think it's hell on earth."
"It's good to see each other."
"No. I don't think it is."
"Don't you want to?"
"I have to."
We were sitting now like two strangers.
On the right was the Parc Montsouris.
The restaurant where they have the pool of live trout and where you can sit and look out over the park was closed and dark.
The driver leaned his head around.
"Where do you want to go?" I asked. Brett turned her head away.
"Oh, go to the Select."
"Café Select," I told the driver. "Boulevard Montparnasse." We drove straight down, turning around the Lion de Belfort that guards the passing Montrouge trams. Brett looked straight ahead. On the Boulevard Raspail, with the lights of Montparnasse in sight, Brett said: "Would you mind very much if I asked you to do something?"
"Don't be silly."
"Kiss me just once more before we get there."
When the taxi stopped I got out and paid.
Brett came out putting on her hat.
She gave me her hand as she stepped down.
Her hand was shaky.
"I say, do I look too much of a mess?" She pulled her man's felt hat down and started in for the bar.
Inside, against the bar and at tables, were most of the crowd who a been at the dance.
"Hello, you chaps," Brett said. "I'm going to have a drink."
"Oh, Brett! Brett!" the little Greek portrait-painter, who called himself a duke, and whom everybody called Zizi, pushed up to her. "I got something fine to tell you."
"Hello, Zizi," Brett said.
"I want you to meet a friend," Zizi said. A fat man came up.
"Count Mippipopolous, meet my friend Lady Ashley."
"How do you do?" said Brett.
"Well, does your Ladyship have a good time here in Paris?" asked Count Mippipopolous, who wore an elk's tooth on his watch-chain.
"Rather," said Brett.
"Paris is a fine town all right," said the count. "But I guess you have pretty big doings yourself over in London."
"Oh, yes," said Brett. "Enormous."
Braddocks called to me from a table.
"Barnes," he said, "have a drink.
That girl of yours got in a frightful row.
"What about?"
"Something the patronne's daughter said. A corking row. She was rather splendid, you know. Showed her yellow card and demanded the patronne's daughter's too. I say it was a row."
"What finally happened?"
"Oh, some one took her home. Not a bad-looking girl. Wonderful command of the idiom. Do stay and have a drink."
"No," I said. "I must shove off. Seen Cohn?"
"He went home with Frances," Mrs. Braddock put in.
"Poor chap, he looks awfully down," Braddocks said.
"I dare say he is," said Mrs. Braddocks.
"I have to shove off," I said. "Good night."
I said good night to Brett at the bar.
The count was buying champagne.
"Will you take a glass of wine with us, sir?" he asked.
"No. Thanks awfully. I have to go."
"Really going?" Brett asked.
"Yes," I said. "I've got a rotten headache."
"I'll see you to-morrow?"
"Come in at the office."
"Hardly."
"Well, where will I see you?"
"Anywhere around five o'clock."
"Make it the other side of town then."
"Good. I'll be at the Crillon at five."
"Try and be there," I said.
"Don't worry," Brett said. "I've never let you down, have I?"
"Heard from Mike?"
"Letter to-day."
"Good night, sir," said the count.
I went out onto the sidewalk and walked down toward the Boulevard St.
Michel, passed the tables of the Rotonde, still crowded, looked across the street at the Dome, its tables running out to the edge of the pavement.
Some one waved at me from a table, I did not see who it was and went on.
I wanted to get home.
The Boulevard Montparnasse was deserted.
Lavigne's was closed tight, and they were stacking the tables outside the Closerie des Lilas.
I passed Ney's statue standing among the new-leaved chestnut-trees in the arc-light.
There was a faded purple wreath leaning against the base.
I stopped and read the inscription: from the Bonapartist Groups, some date; I forget.
He looked very fine, Marshal Ney in his top-boots, gesturing with his sword among the green new horse-chestnut leaves.
My flat was just across the street, a little way down the Boulevard St.
Michel.
There was a light in the concierge's room and I knocked on the door and she gave me my mail.
I wished her good night and went up-stairs.
There were two letters and some papers.
I looked at them under the gas-light in the dining-room.
The letters were from the States.
One was a bank statement.
It showed a balance of $2432.
I got out my check-book and deducted four checks drawn since the first of the month, and discovered I had a balance of $1832.
I wrote this on the back of the statement.
The other letter was a wedding announcement.
and Mrs.
Aloysius Kirby announce the marriage of their daughter Katherine--I knew neither the girl nor the man she was marrying.
They must be circularizing the town.
It was a funny name.
I felt sure I could remember anybody with a name like Aloysius.
It was a good Catholic name.
There was a crest on the announcement.
Like Zizi the Greek duke.
And that count.
The count was funny.
Brett had a title, too.
Lady Ashley.
To hell with Brett.
To hell with you, Lady Ashley.
I lit the lamp beside the bed, turned off the gas, and opened the wide windows.
The bed was far back from the windows, and I sat with the windows open and undressed by the bed.
Outside a night train, running on the street-car tracks, went by carrying vegetables to the markets.
They were noisy at night when you could not sleep.
Undressing, I looked at myself in the mirror of the big armoire beside the bed.
That was a typically French way to furnish a room.
Practical, too, I suppose.
Of all the ways to be wounded.
I suppose it was funny.
I put on my pajamas and got into bed.
I had the two bull-fight papers, and I took their wrappers off.
One was orange.
The other yellow.
They would both have the same news, so whichever I read first would spoil the other.
Le Toril was the better paper, so I started to read it.
I read it all the way through, including the Petite Correspondance and the Cornigrams.
I blew out the lamp.
Perhaps I would be able to sleep.
My head started to work.
The old grievance.
Well, it was a rotten way to be wounded and flying on a joke front like the Italian.
In the Italian hospital we were going to form a society.
It had a funny name in Italian.
I wonder what became of the others, the Italians.
That was in the Ospedale Maggiore in Milano, Padiglione Ponte.
The next building was the Padiglione Zonda.
There was a statue of Ponte, or maybe it was Zonda.
That was where the liaison colonel came to visit me.
That was funny.
That was about the first funny thing.
I was all bandaged up.
But they had told him about it.
Then he made that wonderful speech: "You, a foreigner, an Englishman" (any foreigner was an Englishman) "have given more than your life.
" What a speech! I would like to have it illuminated to hang in the office.
He never laughed.
He was putting himself in my place, I guess.
"Che mala fortuna! Che mala fortuna!".
I never used to realize it, I guess.
I try and play it along and just not make trouble for people.
Probably I never would have had any trouble if I hadn't run into Brett when they shipped me to England.
I suppose she only wanted what she couldn't have.
Well, people were that way.
To hell with people.
The Catholic Church had an awfully good way of handling all that.
Good advice, anyway.
Not to think about it.
Oh, it was swell advice.
Try and take it sometime.
Try and take it.
I lay awake thinking and my mind jumping around.
Then I couldn't keep away from it, and I started to think about Brett and all the rest of it went away.
I was thinking about Brett and my mind stopped jumping around and started to go in sort of smooth waves.
Then all of a sudden I started to cry.
Then after a while it was better and I lay in bed and listened to the heavy trams go by and way down the street, and then I went to sleep.
I woke up.
There was a row going on outside.
I listened and I thought I recognized a voice.
I put on a dressing-gown and went to the door.
The concierge was talking down-stairs.
She was very angry.
I heard my name and called down the stairs.
"Is that you, Monsieur Barnes?" the concierge called.
"Yes. It's me."
"There's a species of woman here who's waked the whole street up. What kind of a dirty business at this time of night! She says she must see you. I've told her you're asleep."
Then I heard Brett's voice.
Half asleep I had been sure it was Georgette.
I don't know why.
She could not have known my address.
"Will you send her up, please?"
Brett came up the stairs.
I saw she was quite drunk.
"Silly thing to do," she said.
"Make an awful row.
I say, you weren't asleep, were you?".
"What did you think I was doing?"
"Don't know. What time is it?"
I looked at the clock.
It was half-past four.
"Had no idea what hour it was," Brett said.
"I say, can a chap sit down? Don't be cross, darling.
Just left the count.
He brought me here.
"What's he like?" I was getting brandy and soda and glasses.
"Just a little," said Brett. "Don't try and make me drunk. The count? Oh, rather. He's quite one of us."
"Is he a count?"
"Here's how. I rather think so, you know. Deserves to be, anyhow. Knows hell's own amount about people. Don't know where he got it all. Owns a chain of sweetshops in the States."
She sipped at her glass.
"Think he called it a chain. Something like that. Linked them all up. Told me a little about it. Damned interesting. He's one of us, though. Oh, quite. No doubt. One can always tell."
She took another drink.
"How do I buck on about all this? You don't mind, do you? He's putting up for Zizi, you know."
"Is Zizi really a duke, too?"
"I shouldn't wonder. Greek, you know. Rotten painter. I rather liked the count."
"Where did you go with him?"
"Oh, everywhere. He just brought me here now. Offered me ten thousand dollars to go to Biarritz with him. How much is that in pounds?"
"Around two thousand."
"Lot of money. I told him I couldn't do it. He was awfully nice about it. Told him I knew too many people in Biarritz."
Brett laughed.
"I say, you are slow on the up-take," she said. I had only sipped my brandy and soda. I took a long drink.
"That's better. Very funny," Brett said. "Then he wanted me to go to Cannes with him. Told him I knew too many people in Cannes. Monte Carlo. Told him I knew too many people in Monte Carlo. Told him I knew too many people everywhere. Quite true, too. So I asked him to bring me here."
She looked at me, her hand on the table, her glass raised.
"Don't look like that," she said.
"Told him I was in love with you.
True, too.
Don't look like that.
He was damn nice about it.
Wants to drive us out to dinner to-morrow night.
Like to go?".
"Why not?"
"I'd better go now."
"Why?"
"Just wanted to see you. Damned silly idea. Want to get dressed and come down? He's got the car just up the street."
"The count?"
"Himself. And a chauffeur in livery. Going to drive me around and have breakfast in the Bois. Hampers. Got it all at Zelli's. Dozen bottles of Mumms. Tempt you?"
"I have to work in the morning," I said. "I'm too far behind you now to catch up and be any fun."
"Don't be an ass."
"Can't do it."
"Right. Send him a tender message?"
"Anything. Absolutely."
"Good night, darling."
"Don't be sentimental."
"You make me ill."
We kissed good night and Brett shivered.
"I'd better go," she said.
"Good night, darling.
"You don't have to go."
"Yes."
We kissed again on the stairs and as I called for the cordon the concierge muttered something behind her door.
I went back up-stairs and from the open window watched Brett walking up the street to the big limousine drawn up to the curb under the arc-light.
She got in and it started off.
I turned around.
On the table was an empty glass and a glass half-full of brandy and soda.
I took them both out to the kitchen and poured the half-full glass down the sink.
I turned off the gas in the dining-room, kicked off my slippers sitting on the bed, and got into bed.
This was Brett, that I had felt like crying about.
Then I thought of her walking up the street and stepping into the car, as I had last seen her, and of course in a little while I felt like hell again.
It is awfully easy to be hard-boiled about everything in the daytime, but at night it is another thing.
In the morning I walked down the Boulevard to the rue Soufflot for coffee and brioche.
It was a fine morning.
The horse-chestnut trees in the Luxembourg gardens were in bloom.
There was the pleasant early-morning feeling of a hot day.
I read the papers with the coffee and then smoked a cigarette.
The flower-women were coming up from the market and arranging their daily stock.
Students went by going up to the law school, or down to the Sorbonne.
The Boulevard was busy with trams and people going to work.
I got on an S bus and rode down to the Madeleine, standing on the back platform.
From the Madeleine I walked along the Boulevard des Capucines to the Opéra, and up to my office.
I passed the man with the jumping frogs and the man with the boxer toys.
I stepped aside to avoid walking into the thread with which his girl assistant manipulated the boxers.
She was standing looking away, the thread in her folded hands.
The man was urging two tourists to buy.
Three more tourists had stopped and were watching.
I walked on behind a man who was pushing a roller that printed the name CINZANO on the sidewalk in damp letters.
All along people were going to work.
It felt pleasant to be going to work.
I walked across the avenue and turned in to my office.
Up-stairs in the office I read the French morning papers, smoked, and then sat at the typewriter and got off a good morning's work.
At eleven o'clock I went over to the Quai d'Orsay in a taxi and went in and sat with about a dozen correspondents, while the foreign-office mouthpiece, a young Nouvelle Revue Française diplomat in horn-rimmed spectacles, talked and answered questions for half an hour.
The President of the Council was in Lyons making a speech, or, rather he was on his way back.
Several people asked questions to hear themselves talk and there were a couple of questions asked by news service men who wanted to know the answers.
There was no news.
I shared a taxi back from the Quai d'Orsay with Woolsey and Krum.
"What do you do nights, Jake?" asked Krum. "I never see you around."
"Oh, I'm over in the Quarter."
"I'm coming over some night. The Dingo. That's the great place, isn't it?"
"Yes. That, or this new dive, The Select."
"I've meant to get over," said Krum. "You know how it is, though, with a wife and kids."
"Playing any tennis?" Woolsey asked.
"Well, no," said Krum. "I can't say I've played any this year. I've tried to get away, but Sundays it's always rained, and the courts are so damned crowded."
"The Englishmen all have Saturday off," Woolsey said.
"Lucky beggars," said Krum. "Well, I'll tell you. Some day I'm not going to be working for an agency. Then I'll have plenty of time to get out in the country."
"That's the thing to do. Live out in the country and have a little car."
"I've been thinking some about getting a car next year."
I banged on the glass.
The chauffeur stopped.
"Here's my street," I said.
"Come in and have a drink.
"Thanks, old man," Krum said. Woolsey shook his head. "I've got to file that line he got off this morning."
I put a two-franc piece in Krum's hand.
"You're crazy, Jake," he said. "This is on me."
"It's all on the office, anyway."
"Nope. I want to get it."
I waved good-by.
Krum put his head out.
"See you at the lunch on Wednesday.
"You bet."
I went to the office in the elevator.
Robert Cohn was waiting for me.
"Hello, Jake," he said.
"Going out to lunch?".
"Yes. Let me see if there is anything new."
"Where will we eat?"
"Anywhere."
I was looking over my desk.
"Where do you want to eat?".
"How about Wetzel's? They've got good hors d'oeuvres."
In the restaurant we ordered hors d'oeuvres and beer.
The sommelier brought the beer, tall, beaded on the outside of the steins, and cold.
There were a dozen different dishes of hors d'oeuvres.
"Have any fun last night?" I asked.
"No. I don't think so."
"How's the writing going?"
"Rotten. I can't get this second book going."
"That happens to everybody."
"Oh, I'm sure of that. It gets me worried, though."
"Thought any more about going to South America?"
"I mean that."
"Well, why don't you start off?"
"Frances."
"Well," I said, "take her with you."
"She wouldn't like it. That isn't the sort of thing she likes. She likes a lot of people around."
"Tell her to go to hell."
"I can't. I've got certain obligations to her."
He shoved the sliced cucumbers away and took a pickled herring.
"What do you know about Lady Brett Ashley, Jake?"
"Her name's Lady Ashley. Brett's her own name. She's a nice girl," I said. "She's getting a divorce and she's going to marry Mike Campbell. He's over in Scotland now. Why?"
"She's a remarkably attractive woman."
"Isn't she?"
"There's a certain quality about her, a certain fineness. She seems to be absolutely fine and straight."
"She's very nice."
"I don't know how to describe the quality," Cohn said. "I suppose it's breeding."
"You sound as though you liked her pretty well."
"I do. I shouldn't wonder if I were in love with her."
"She's a drunk," I said. "She's in love with Mike Campbell, and she's going to marry him. He's going to be rich as hell some day."
"I don't believe she'll ever marry him."
"Why not?"
"I don't know. I just don't believe it. Have you known her a long time?"
"Yes," I said. "She was a V. A. D. in a hospital I was in during the war."
"She must have been just a kid then."
"She's thirty-four now."
"When did she marry Ashley?"
"During the war. Her own true love had just kicked off with the dysentery."
"You talk sort of bitter."
"Sorry. I didn't mean to. I was just trying to give you the facts."
"I don't believe she would marry anybody she didn't love."
"Well," I said. "She's done it twice."
"I don't believe it."
"Well," I said, "don't ask me a lot of fool questions if you don't like the answers."
"I didn't ask you that."
"You asked me what I knew about Brett Ashley."
"I didn't ask you to insult her."
"Oh, go to hell."
He stood up from the table his face white, and stood there white and angry behind the little plates of hors d'oeuvres.
"Sit down," I said. "Don't be a fool."
"You've got to take that back."
"Oh, cut out the prep-school stuff."
"Take it back."
"Sure. Anything. I never heard of Brett Ashley. How's that?
"No. Not that. About me going to hell."
"Oh, don't go to hell," I said. "Stick around. We're just starting lunch."
Cohn smiled again and sat down.
He seemed glad to sit down.
What the hell would he have done if he hadn't sat down? "You say such damned insulting things, Jake.
"I'm sorry. I've got a nasty tongue. I never mean it when I say nasty things."
"I know it," Cohn said. "You're really about the best friend I have, Jake."
God help you, I thought.
"Forget what I said," I said out loud.
"I'm sorry.
"It's all right. It's fine. I was just sore for a minute."
"Good. Let's get something else to eat."
After we finished the lunch we walked up to the Café de la Paix and had coffee.
I could feel Cohn wanted to bring up Brett again, but I held him off it.
We talked about one thing and another, and I left him to come to the office.
At five o'clock I was in the Hotel Crillon waiting for Brett.
She was not there, so I sat down and wrote some letters.
They were not very good letters but I hoped their being on Crillon stationery would help them.
Brett did not turn up, so about quarter to six I went down to the bar and had a Jack Rose with George the barman.
Brett had not been in the bar either, and so I looked for her up-stairs on my way out, and took a taxi to the Café Select.
Crossing the Seine I saw a string of barges being towed empty down the current, riding high, the bargemen at the sweeps as they came toward the bridge.
The river looked nice.
It was always pleasant crossing bridges in Paris.
The taxi rounded the statue of the inventor of the semaphore engaged in doing same, and turned up the Boulevard Raspail, and I sat back to let that part of the ride pass.
The Boulevard Raspail always made dull riding.
It was like a certain stretch on the P.
between Fontainebleau and Montereau that always made me feel bored and dead and dull until it was over.
I suppose it is some association of ideas that makes those dead places in a journey.
There are other streets in Paris as ugly as the Boulevard Raspail.
It is a street I do not mind walking down at all.
But I cannot stand to ride along it.
Perhaps I had read something about it once.
That was the way Robert Cohn was about all of Paris.
I wondered where Cohn got that incapacity to enjoy Paris.
Possibly from Mencken.
Mencken hates Paris, I believe.
So many young men get their likes and dislikes from Mencken.
The taxi stopped in front of the Rotonde.
No matter what café in Montparnasse you ask a taxi-driver to bring you to from the right bank of the river, they always take you to the Rotonde.
Ten years from now it will probably be the Dome.
It was near enough, anyway.
I walked past the sad tables of the Rotonde to the Select.
There were a few people inside at the bar, and outside, alone, sat Harvey Stone.
He had a pile of saucers in front of him, and he needed a shave.
"Sit down," said Harvey, "I've been looking for you."
"What's the matter?"
"Nothing. Just looking for you."
"Been out to the races?"
"No. Not since Sunday."
"What do you hear from the States?"
"Nothing. Absolutely nothing."
"What's the matter?"
"I don't know. I'm through with them. I'm absolutely through with them."
He leaned forward and looked me in the eye.
"Do you want to know something, Jake?"
"Yes."
"I haven't had anything to eat for five days."
I figured rapidly back in my mind.
It was three days ago that Harvey had won two hundred francs from me shaking poker dice in the New York Bar.
"What's the matter?"
"No money. Money hasn't come," he paused. "I tell you it's strange, Jake. When I'm like this I just want to be alone. I want to stay in my own room. I'm like a cat."
I felt in my pocket.
"Would a hundred help you any, Harvey?"
"Yes."
"Come on. Let's go and eat."
"There's no hurry. Have a drink."
"Better eat."
"No. When I get like this I don't care whether I eat or not."
We had a drink.
Harvey added my saucer to his own pile.
"Do you know Mencken, Harvey?"
"Yes. Why?"
"What's he like?"
"He's all right. He says some pretty funny things. Last time I had dinner with him we talked about Hoffenheimer. 'The trouble is,' he said, 'he's a garter snapper.' That's not bad."
"That's not bad."
"He's through now," Harvey went on. "He's written about all the things he knows, and now he's on all the things he doesn't know."
"I guess he's all right," I said. "I just can't read him."
"Oh, nobody reads him now," Harvey said, "except the people that used to read the Alexander Hamilton Institute."
"Well," I said. "That was a good thing, too."
"Sure," said Harvey. So we sat and thought deeply for a while.
"Have another port?"
"All right," said Harvey.
"There comes Cohn," I said. Robert Cohn was crossing the street.
"That moron," said Harvey. Cohn came up to our table.
"Hello, you bums," he said.
"Hello, Robert," Harvey said. "I was just telling Jake here that you're a moron."
"What do you mean?"
"Tell us right off. Don't think. What would you rather do if you could do anything you wanted?"
Cohn started to consider.
"Don't think. Bring it right out."
"I don't know," Cohn said. "What's it all about, anyway?"
"I mean what would you rather do. What comes into your head first. No matter how silly it is."
"I don't know," Cohn said. "I think I'd rather play football again with what I know about handling myself, now."
"I misjudged you," Harvey said. "You're not a moron. You're only a case of arrested development."
"You're awfully funny, Harvey," Cohn said. "Some day somebody will push your face in."
Harvey Stone laughed.
"You think so.
They won't, though.
Because it wouldn't make any difference to me.
I'm not a fighter.
"It would make a difference to you if anybody did it."
"No, it wouldn't. That's where you make your big mistake. Because you're not intelligent."
"Cut it out about me."
"Sure," said Harvey. "It doesn't make any difference to me. You don't mean anything to me."
"Come on, Harvey," I said. "Have another porto."
"No," he said. "I'm going up the street and eat. See you later, Jake."
He walked out and up the street.
I watched him crossing the street through the taxis, small, heavy, slowly sure of himself in the traffic.
"He always gets me sore," Cohn said. "I can't stand him."
"I like him," I said. "I'm fond of him. You don't want to get sore at him."
"I know it," Cohn said. "He just gets on my nerves."
"Write this afternoon?"
"No. I couldn't get it going. It's harder to do than my first book. I'm having a hard time handling it."
The sort of healthy conceit that he had when he returned from America early in the spring was gone.
Then he had been sure of his work, only with these personal longings for adventure.
Now the sureness was gone.
Somehow I feel I have not shown Robert Cohn clearly.
The reason is that until he fell in love with Brett, I never heard him make one remark that would, in any way, detach him from other people.
He was nice to watch on the tennis-court, he had a good body, and he kept it in shape; he handled his cards well at bridge, and he had a funny sort of undergraduate quality about him.
If he were in a crowd nothing he said stood out.
He wore what used to be called polo shirts at school, and may be called that still, but he was not professionally youthful.
I do not believe he thought about his clothes much.
Externally he had been formed at Princeton.
Internally he had been moulded by the two women who had trained him.
He had a nice, boyish sort of cheerfulness that had never been trained out of him, and I probably have not brought it out.
He loved to win at tennis.
He probably loved to win as much as Lenglen, for instance.
On the other hand, he was not angry at being beaten.
When he fell in love with Brett his tennis game went all to pieces.
People beat him who had never had a chance with him.
He was very nice about it.
Anyhow, we were sitting on the terrace of the Café Select, and Harvey Stone had just crossed the street.
"Come on up to the Lilas," I said.
"I have a date."
"What time?"
"Frances is coming here at seven-fifteen."
"There she is."
Frances Clyne was coming toward us from across the street.
She was a very tall girl who walked with a great deal of movement.
She waved and smiled.
We watched her cross the street.
"Hello," she said, "I'm so glad you're here, Jake. I've been wanting to talk to you."
"Hello, Frances," said Cohn. He smiled.
"Why, hello, Robert. Are you here?" She went on, talking rapidly. "I've had the darndest time. This one"--shaking her head at Cohn--"didn't come home for lunch."
"I wasn't supposed to."
"Oh, I know. But you didn't say anything about it to the cook. Then I had a date myself, and Paula wasn't at her office. I went to the Ritz and waited for her, and she never came, and of course I didn't have enough money to lunch at the Ritz----"
"What did you do?"
"Oh, went out, of course." She spoke in a sort of imitation joyful manner. "I always keep my appointments. No one keeps theirs, nowadays. I ought to know better. How are you, Jake, anyway?"
"Fine."
"That was a fine girl you had at the dance, and then went off with that Brett one."
"Don't you like her?" Cohn asked.
"I think she's perfectly charming. Don't you?"
Cohn said nothing.
"Look, Jake. I want to talk with you. Would you come over with me to the Dome? You'll stay here, won't you, Robert? Come on, Jake."
We crossed the Boulevard Montparnasse and sat down at a table.
A boy came up with the Paris Times, and I bought one and opened it.
"What's the matter, Frances?"
"Oh, nothing," she said, "except that he wants to leave me."
"How do you mean?"
"Oh, he told every one that we were going to be married, and I told my mother and every one, and now he doesn't want to do it."
"What's the matter?"
"He's decided he hasn't lived enough. I knew it would happen when he went to New York."
She looked up, very bright-eyed and trying to talk inconsequentially.
"I wouldn't marry him if he doesn't want to. Of course I wouldn't. I wouldn't marry him now for anything. But it does seem to me to be a little late now, after we've waited three years, and I've just gotten my divorce."
I said nothing.
"We were going to celebrate so, and instead we've just had scenes. It's so childish. We have dreadful scenes, and he cries and begs me to be reasonable, but he says he just can't do it."
"It's rotten luck."
"I should say it is rotten luck. I've wasted two years and a half on him now. And I don't know now if any man will ever want to marry me. Two years ago I could have married anybody I wanted, down at Cannes. All the old ones that wanted to marry somebody chic and settle down were crazy about me. Now I don't think I could get anybody."
"Sure, you could marry anybody."
"No, I don't believe it. And I'm fond of him, too. And I'd like to have children. I always thought we'd have children."
She looked at me very brightly.
"I never liked children much, but I don't want to think I'll never have them.
I always thought I'd have them and then like them.
"He's got children."
"Oh, yes. He's got children, and he's got money, and he's got a rich mother, and he's written a book, and nobody will publish my stuff; nobody at all. It isn't bad, either. And I haven't got any money at all. I could have had alimony, but I got the divorce the quickest way."
She looked at me again very brightly.
"It isn't right. It's my own fault and it's not, too. I ought to have known better. And when I tell him he just cries and says he can't marry. Why can't he marry? I'd be a good wife. I'm easy to get along with. I leave him alone. It doesn't do any good."
"It's a rotten shame."
"Yes, it is a rotten shame. But there's no use talking about it, is there? Come on, let's go back to the café."
"And of course there isn't anything I can do."
"No. Just don't let him know I talked to you. I know what he wants." Now for the first time she dropped her bright, terribly cheerful manner. "He wants to go back to New York alone, and be there when his book comes out so when a lot of little chickens like it. That's what he wants."
"Maybe they won't like it. I don't think he's that way. Really."
"You don't know him like I do, Jake. That's what he wants to do. I know it. I know it. That's why he doesn't want to marry. He wants to have a big triumph this fall all by himself."
"Want to go back to the café?"
"Yes. Come on."
We got up from the table--they had never brought us a drink--and started across the street toward the Select, where Cohn sat smiling at us from behind the marble-topped table.
"Well, what are you smiling at?" Frances asked him. "Feel pretty happy?"
"I was smiling at you and Jake with your secrets."
"Oh, what I've told Jake isn't any secret. Everybody will know it soon enough. I only wanted to give Jake a decent version."
"What was it? About your going to England?"
"Yes, about my going to England. Oh, Jake! I forgot to tell you. I'm going to England."
"Isn't that fine!"
"Yes, that's the way it's done in the very best families. Robert's sending me. He's going to give me two hundred pounds and then I'm going to visit friends. Won't it be lovely? The friends don't know about it, yet."
She turned to Cohn and smiled at him.
He was not smiling now.
"You were only going to give me a hundred pounds, weren't you, Robert? But I made him give me two hundred. He's really very generous. Aren't you, Robert?"
I do not know how people could say such terrible things to Robert Cohn.
There are people to whom you could not say insulting things.
They give you a feeling that the world would be destroyed, would actually be destroyed before your eyes, if you said certain things.
But here was Cohn taking it all.
Here it was, all going on right before me, and I did not even feel an impulse to try and stop it.
And this was friendly joking to what went on later.
"How can you say such things, Frances?" Cohn interrupted.
"Listen to him. I'm going to England. I'm going to visit friends. Ever visit friends that didn't want you? Oh, they'll have to take me, all right. 'How do you do, my dear? Such a long time since we've seen you. And how is your dear mother?' Yes, how is my dear mother? She put all her money into French war bonds. Yes, she did. Probably the only person in the world that did. 'And what about Robert?' or else very careful talking around Robert. 'You must be most careful not to mention him, my dear. Poor Frances has had a most unfortunate experience.' Won't it be fun, Robert? Don't you think it will be fun, Jake?"
She turned to me with that terribly bright smile.
It was very satisfactory to her to have an audience for this.
"And where are you going to be, Robert? It's my own fault, all right. Perfectly my own fault. When I made you get rid of your little secretary on the magazine I ought to have known you'd get rid of me the same way. Jake doesn't know about that. Should I tell him?"
"Shut up, Frances, for God's sake."
"Yes, I'll tell him. Robert had a little secretary on the magazine. Just the sweetest little thing in the world, and he thought she was wonderful, and then I came along and he thought I was pretty wonderful, too. So I made him get rid of her, and he had brought her to Provincetown from Carmel when he moved the magazine, and he didn't even pay her fare back to the coast. All to please me. He thought I was pretty fine, then. Didn't you, Robert?
"You mustn't misunderstand, Jake, it was absolutely platonic with the secretary. Not even platonic. Nothing at all, really. It was just that she was so nice. And he did that just to please me. Well, I suppose that we that live by the sword shall perish by the sword. Isn't that literary, though? You want to remember that for your next book, Robert.
"You know Robert is going to get material for a new book. Aren't you, Robert? That's why he's leaving me. He's decided I don't film well. You see, he was so busy all the time that we were living together, writing on this book, that he doesn't remember anything about us. So now he's going out and get some new material. Well, I hope he gets something frightfully interesting.
"Listen, Robert, dear. Let me tell you something. You won't mind, will you? Don't have scenes with your young ladies. Try not to. Because you can't have scenes without crying, and then you pity yourself so much you can't remember what the other person's said. You'll never be able to remember any conversations that way. Just try and be calm. I know it's awfully hard. But remember, it's for literature. We all ought to make sacrifices for literature. Look at me. I'm going to England without a protest. All for literature. We must all help young writers. Don't you think so, Jake? But you're not a young writer. Are you, Robert? You're thirty-four. Still, I suppose that is young for a great writer. Look at Hardy. Look at Anatole France. He just died a little while ago. Robert doesn't think he's any good, though. Some of his French friends told him. He doesn't read French very well himself. He wasn't a good writer like you are, was he, Robert? Do you think he ever had to go and look for material? What do you suppose he said to his mistresses when he wouldn't marry them? I wonder if he cried, too? Oh, I've just thought of something." She put her gloved hand up to her lips. "I know the real reason why Robert won't marry me, Jake. It's just come to me. They've sent it to me in a vision in the Café Select. Isn't it mystic? Some day they'll put a tablet up. Like at Lourdes. Do you want to hear, Robert? I'll tell you. It's so simple. I wonder why I never thought about it. Why, you see, Robert's always wanted to have a mistress, and if he doesn't marry me, why, then he's had one. She was his mistress for over two years. See how it is? And if he marries me, like he's always promised he would, that would be the end of all the romance. Don't you think that's bright of me to figure that out? It's true, too. Look at him and see if it's not. Where are you going, Jake?"
"I've got to go in and see Harvey Stone a minute."
Cohn looked up as I went in.
His face was white.
Why did he sit there? Why did he keep on taking it like that?.
As I stood against the bar looking out I could see them through the window.
Frances was talking on to him, smiling brightly, looking into his face each time she asked: "Isn't it so, Robert?" Or maybe she did not ask that now.
Perhaps she said something else.
I told the barman I did not want anything to drink and went out through the side door.
As I went out the door I looked back through the two thicknesses of glass and saw them sitting there.
She was still talking to him.
I went down a side street to the Boulevard Raspail.
A taxi came along and I got in and gave the driver the address of my flat.
As I started up the stairs the concierge knocked on the glass of the door of her lodge, and as I stopped she came out.
She had some letters and a telegram.
"Here is the post. And there was a lady here to see you."
"Did she leave a card?"
"No. She was with a gentleman. It was the one who was here last night. In the end I find she is very nice."
"Was she with a friend of mine?"
"I don't know. He was never here before. He was very large. Very, very large. She was very nice. Very, very nice. Last night she was, perhaps, a little--" She put her head on one hand and rocked it up and down. "I'll speak perfectly frankly, Monsieur Barnes. Last night I found her not so gentille. Last night I formed another idea of her. But listen to what I tell you. She is très, très gentille. She is of very good family. It is a thing you can see."
"They did not leave any word?"
"Yes. They said they would be back in an hour."
"Send them up when they come."
"Yes, Monsieur Barnes. And that lady, that lady there is some one. An eccentric, perhaps, but quelqu'une, quelqu'une!"
The concierge, before she became a concierge, had owned a drink-selling concession at the Paris race-courses.
Her life-work lay in the pelouse, but she kept an eye on the people of the pesage, and she took great pride in telling me which of my guests were well brought up, which were of good family, who were sportsmen, a French word pronounced with the accent on the men.
The only trouble was that people who did not fall into any of those three categories were very liable to be told there was no one home, chez Barnes.
One of my friends, an extremely underfed-looking painter, who was obviously to Madame Duzinell neither well brought up, of good family, nor a sportsman, wrote me a letter asking if I could get him a pass to get by the concierge so he could come up and see me occasionally in the evenings.
I went up to the flat wondering what Brett had done to the concierge.
The wire was a cable from Bill Gorton, saying he was arriving on the France.
I put the mail on the table, went back to the bedroom, undressed and had a shower.
I was rubbing down when I heard the door-bell pull.
I put on a bathrobe and slippers and went to the door.
It was Brett.
Back of her was the count.
He was holding a great bunch of roses.
"Hello, darling," said Brett. "Aren't you going to let us in?"
"Come on. I was just bathing."
"Aren't you the fortunate man. Bathing."
"Only a shower. Sit down, Count Mippipopolous. What will you drink?"
"I don't know whether you like flowers, sir," the count said, "but I took the liberty of just bringing these roses."
"Here, give them to me." Brett took them. "Get me some water in this, Jake." I filled the big earthenware jug with water in the kitchen, and Brett put the roses in it, and placed them in the centre of the dining-room table.
"I say. We have had a day."
"You don't remember anything about a date with me at the Crillon?"
"No. Did we have one? I must have been blind."
"You were quite drunk, my dear," said the count.
"Wasn't I, though? And the count's been a brick, absolutely."
"You've got hell's own drag with the concierge now."
"I ought to have. Gave her two hundred francs."
"Don't be a damned fool."
"His," she said, and nodded at the count.
"I thought we ought to give her a little something for last night. It was very late."
"He's wonderful," Brett said. "He remembers everything that's happened."
"So do you, my dear."
"Fancy," said Brett. "Who'd want to? I say, Jake, do we get a drink?"
"You get it while I go in and dress. You know where it is."
"Rather."
While I dressed I heard Brett put down glasses and then a siphon, and then heard them talking.
I dressed slowly, sitting on the bed.
I felt tired and pretty rotten.
Brett came in the room, a glass in her hand, and sat on the bed.
"What's the matter, darling? Do you feel rocky?"
She kissed me coolly on the forehead.
"Oh, Brett, I love you so much."
"Darling," she said. Then: "Do you want me to send him away?"
"No. He's nice."
"I'll send him away."
"No, don't."
"Yes, I'll send him away."
"You can't just like that."
"Can't I, though? You stay here. He's mad about me, I tell you."
She was gone out of the room.
I lay face down on the bed.
I was having a bad time.
I heard them talking but I did not listen.
Brett came in and sat on the bed.
"Poor old darling." She stroked my head.
"What did you say to him?" I was lying with my face away from her. I did not want to see her.
"Sent him for champagne. He loves to go for champagne."
Then later: "Do you feel better, darling? Is the head any better?".
"It's better."
"Lie quiet. He's gone to the other side of town."
"Couldn't we live together, Brett? Couldn't we just live together?"
"I don't think so. I'd just tromper you with everybody. You couldn't stand it."
"I stand it now."
"That would be different. It's my fault, Jake. It's the way I'm made."
"Couldn't we go off in the country for a while?"
"It wouldn't be any good. I'll go if you like. But I couldn't live quietly in the country. Not with my own true love."
"I know."
"Isn't it rotten? There isn't any use my telling you I love you."
"You know I love you."
"Let's not talk. Talking's all bilge. I'm going away from you, and then Michael's coming back."
"Why are you going away?"
"Better for you. Better for me."
"When are you going?"
"Soon as I can."
"Where?"
"San Sebastian."
"Can't we go together?"
"No. That would be a hell of an idea after we'd just talked it out."
"We never agreed."
"Oh, you know as well as I do. Don't be obstinate, darling."
"Oh, sure," I said. "I know you're right. I'm just low, and when I'm low I talk like a fool."
I sat up, leaned over, found my shoes beside the bed and put them on.
I stood up.
"Don't look like that, darling."
"How do you want me to look?"
"Oh, don't be a fool. I'm going away to-morrow."
"To-morrow?"
"Yes. Didn't I say so? I am."
"Let's have a drink, then. The count will be back."
"Yes. He should be back. You know he's extraordinary about buying champagne. It means any amount to him."
We went into the dining-room.
I took up the brandy bottle and poured Brett a drink and one for myself.
There was a ring at the bell-pull.
I went to the door and there was the count.
Behind him was the chauffeur carrying a basket of champagne.
"Where should I have him put it, sir?" asked the count.
"In the kitchen," Brett said.
"Put it in there, Henry," the count motioned. "Now go down and get the ice." He stood looking after the basket inside the kitchen door. "I think you'll find that's very good wine," he said. "I know we don't get much of a chance to judge good wine in the States now, but I got this from a friend of mine that's in the business."
"Oh, you always have some one in the trade," Brett said.
"This fellow raises the grapes. He's got thousands of acres of them."
"What's his name?" asked Brett. "Veuve Cliquot?"
"No," said the count. "Mumms. He's a baron."
"Isn't it wonderful," said Brett. "We all have titles. Why haven't you a title, Jake?"
"I assure you, sir," the count put his hand on my arm. "It never does a man any good. Most of the time it costs you money."
"Oh, I don't know. It's damned useful sometimes," Brett said.
"I've never known it to do me any good."
"You haven't used it properly. I've had hell's own amount of credit on mine."
"Do sit down, count," I said. "Let me take that stick."
The count was looking at Brett across the table under the gas-light.
She was smoking a cigarette and flicking the ashes on the rug.
She saw me notice it.
"I say, Jake, I don't want to ruin your rugs.
Can't you give a chap an ash-tray?".
I found some ash-trays and spread them around.
The chauffeur came up with a bucket full of salted ice.
"Put two bottles in it, Henry," the count called.
"Anything else, sir?"
"No. Wait down in the car." He turned to Brett and to me. "We'll want to ride out to the Bois for dinner?"
"If you like," Brett said. "I couldn't eat a thing."
"I always like a good meal," said the count.
"Should I bring the wine in, sir?" asked the chauffeur.
"Yes. Bring it in, Henry," said the count. He took out a heavy pigskin cigar-case and offered it to me. "Like to try a real American cigar?"
"Thanks," I said. "I'll finish the cigarette."
He cut off the end of his cigar with a gold cutter he wore on one end of his watch-chain.
"I like a cigar to really draw," said the count "Half the cigars you smoke don't draw."
He lit the cigar, puffed at it, looking across the table at Brett.
"And when you're divorced, Lady Ashley, then you won't have a title.
"No. What a pity."
"No," said the count. "You don't need a title. You got class all over you."
"Thanks. Awfully decent of you."
"I'm not joking you," the count blew a cloud of smoke. "You got the most class of anybody I ever seen. You got it. That's all."
"Nice of you," said Brett. "Mummy would be pleased. Couldn't you write it out, and I'll send it in a letter to her."
"I'd tell her, too," said the count. "I'm not joking you. I never joke people. Joke people and you make enemies. That's what I always say."
"You're right," Brett said. "You're terribly right. I always joke people and I haven't a friend in the world. Except Jake here."
"You don't joke him."
"That's it."
"Do you, now?" asked the count. "Do you joke him?"
Brett looked at me and wrinkled up the corners of her eyes.
"No," she said. "I wouldn't joke him."
"See," said the count. "You don't joke him."
"This is a hell of a dull talk," Brett said. "How about some of that champagne?"
The count reached down and twirled the bottles in the shiny bucket.
"It isn't cold, yet.
You're always drinking, my dear.
Why don't you just talk?".
"I've talked too ruddy much. I've talked myself all out to Jake."
"I should like to hear you really talk, my dear. When you talk to me you never finish your sentences at all."
"Leave 'em for you to finish. Let any one finish them as they like."
"It is a very interesting system," the count reached down and gave the bottles a twirl. "Still I would like to hear you talk some time."
"Isn't he a fool?" Brett asked.
"Now," the count brought up a bottle. "I think this is cool."
I brought a towel and he wiped the bottle dry and held it up.
"I like to drink champagne from magnums.
The wine is better but it would have been too hard to cool.
" He held the bottle, looking at it.
I put out the glasses.
"I say. You might open it," Brett suggested.
"Yes, my dear. Now I'll open it."
It was amazing champagne.
"I say that is wine," Brett held up her glass. "We ought to toast something. 'Here's to royalty.'"
"This wine is too good for toast-drinking, my dear. You don't want to mix emotions up with a wine like that. You lose the taste."
Brett's glass was empty.
"You ought to write a book on wines, count," I said.
"Mr. Barnes," answered the count, "all I want out of wines is to enjoy them."
"Let's enjoy a little more of this," Brett pushed her glass forward. The count poured very carefully. "There, my dear. Now you enjoy that slowly, and then you can get drunk."
"Drunk? Drunk?"
"My dear, you are charming when you are drunk."
"Listen to the man."
"Mr. Barnes," the count poured my glass full. "She is the only lady I have ever known who was as charming when she was drunk as when she was sober."
"You haven't been around much, have you?"
"Yes, my dear. I have been around very much. I have been around a very great deal."
"Drink your wine," said Brett. "We've all been around. I dare say Jake here has seen as much as you have."
"My dear, I am sure Mr. Barnes has seen a lot. Don't think I don't think so, sir. I have seen a lot, too."
"Of course you have, my dear," Brett said. "I was only ragging."
"I have been in seven wars and four revolutions," the count said.
"Soldiering?" Brett asked.
"Sometimes, my dear. And I have got arrow wounds. Have you ever seen arrow wounds?"
"Let's have a look at them."
The count stood up, unbuttoned his vest, and opened his shirt.
He pulled up the undershirt onto his chest and stood, his chest black, and big stomach muscles bulging under the light.
"You see them?"
Below the line where his ribs stopped were two raised white welts.
"See on the back where they come out.
" Above the small of the back were the same two scars, raised as thick as a finger.
"I say. Those are something."
"Clean through."
The count was tucking in his shirt.
"Where did you get those?" I asked.
"In Abyssinia. When I was twenty-one years old."
"What were you doing?" asked Brett. "Were you in the army?"
"I was on a business trip, my dear."
"I told you he was one of us. Didn't I?" Brett turned to me. "I love you, count. You're a darling."
"You make me very happy, my dear. But it isn't true."
"Don't be an ass."
"You see, Mr. Barnes, it is because I have lived very much that now I can enjoy everything so well. Don't you find it like that?"
"Yes. Absolutely."
"I know," said the count. "That is the secret. You must get to know the values."
"Doesn't anything ever happen to your values?" Brett asked.
"No. Not any more."
"Never fall in love?"
"Always," said the count. "I am always in love."
"What does that do to your values?"
"That, too, has got a place in my values."
"You haven't any values. You're dead, that's all."
"No, my dear. You're not right. I'm not dead at all."
We drank three bottles of the champagne and the count left the basket in my kitchen.
We dined at a restaurant in the Bois.
It was a good dinner.
Food had an excellent place in the count's values.
So did wine.
The count was in fine form during the meal.
So was Brett.
It was a good party.
"Where would you like to go?" asked the count after dinner. We were the only people left in the restaurant. The two waiters were standing over against the door. They wanted to go home.
"We might go up on the hill," Brett said. "Haven't we had a splendid party?"
The count was beaming.
He was very happy.
"You are very nice people," he said. He was smoking a cigar again. "Why don't you get married, you two?"
"We want to lead our own lives," I said.
"We have our careers," Brett said. "Come on. Let's get out of this."
"Have another brandy," the count said.
"Get it on the hill."
"No. Have it here where it is quiet."
"You and your quiet," said Brett. "What is it men feel about quiet?"
"We like it," said the count. "Like you like noise, my dear."
"All right," said Brett. "Let's have one."
"Sommelier!" the count called.
"Yes, sir."
"What is the oldest brandy you have?"
"Eighteen eleven, sir."
"Bring us a bottle."
"I say. Don't be ostentatious. Call him off, Jake."
"Listen, my dear. I get more value for my money in old brandy than in any other antiquities."
"Got many antiquities?"
"I got a houseful."
Finally we went up to Montmartre.
Inside Zelli's it was crowded, smoky, and noisy.
The music hit you as you went in.
Brett and I danced.
It was so crowded we could barely move.
The nigger drummer waved at Brett.
We were caught in the jam, dancing in one place in front of him.
"Hahre you?"
"Great."
"Thaats good."
He was all teeth and lips.
"He's a great friend of mine," Brett said. "Damn good drummer."
The music stopped and we started toward the table where the count sat.
Then the music started again and we danced.
I looked at the count.
He was sitting at the table smoking a cigar.
The music stopped again.
"Let's go over."
Brett started toward the table.
The music started and again we danced, tight in the crowd.
"You are a rotten dancer, Jake. Michael's the best dancer I know."
"He's splendid."
"He's got his points."
"I like him," I said. "I'm damned fond of him."
"I'm going to marry him," Brett said. "Funny. I haven't thought about him for a week."
"Don't you write him?"
"Not I. Never write letters."
"I'll bet he writes to you."
"Rather. Damned good letters, too."
"When are you going to get married?"
"How do I know? As soon as we can get the divorce. Michael's trying to get his mother to put up for it."
"Could I help you?"
"Don't be an ass. Michael's people have loads of money."
The music stopped.
We walked over to the table.
The count stood up.
"Very nice," he said. "You looked very, very nice."
"Don't you dance, count?" I asked.
"No. I'm too old."
"Oh, come off it," Brett said.
"My dear, I would do it if I would enjoy it. I enjoy to watch you dance."
"Splendid," Brett said. "I'll dance again for you some time. I say. What about your little friend, Zizi?"
"Let me tell you. I support that boy, but I don't want to have him around."
"He is rather hard."
"You know I think that boy's got a future. But personally I don't want him around."
"Jake's rather the same way."
"He gives me the willys."
"Well," the count shrugged his shoulders. "About his future you can't ever tell. Anyhow, his father was a great friend of my father."
"Come on. Let's dance," Brett said.
We danced.
It was crowded and close.
"Oh, darling," Brett said, "I'm so miserable."
I had that feeling of going through something that has all happened before.
"You were happy a minute ago.
The drummer shouted: "You can't two time--".
"It's all gone."
"What's the matter?"
"I don't know. I just feel terribly."
"......" the drummer chanted. Then turned to his sticks.
"Want to go?"
I had the feeling as in a nightmare of it all being something repeated, something I had been through and that now I must go through again.
"......" the drummer sang softly.
"Let's go," said Brett. "You don't mind."
"......" the drummer shouted and grinned at Brett.
"All right," I said. We got out from the crowd. Brett went to the dressing-room.
"Brett wants to go," I said to the count. He nodded. "Does she? That's fine. You take the car. I'm going to stay here for a while, Mr. Barnes."
We shook hands.
"It was a wonderful time," I said. "I wish you would let me get this." I took a note out of my pocket.
"Mr. Barnes, don't be ridiculous," the count said.
Brett came over with her wrap on.
She kissed the count and put her hand on his shoulder to keep him from standing up.
As we went out the door I looked back and there were three girls at his table.
We got into the big car.
Brett gave the chauffeur the address of her hotel.
"No, don't come up," she said at the hotel. She had rung and the door was unlatched.
"Really?"
"No. Please."
"Good night, Brett," I said. "I'm sorry you feel rotten."
"Good night, Jake. Good night, darling. I won't see you again." We kissed standing at the door. She pushed me away. We kissed again. "Oh, don't!" Brett said.
She turned quickly and went into the hotel.
The chauffeur drove me around to my flat.
I gave him twenty francs and he touched his cap and said: "Good night, sir," and drove off.
I rang the bell.
The door opened and I went up-stairs and went to bed.
BOOK II.
I did not see Brett again until she came back from San Sebastian.
One card came from her from there.
It had a picture of the Concha, and said: "Darling.
Very quiet and healthy.
Love to all the chaps.
BRETT.
Nor did I see Robert Cohn again.
I heard Frances had left for England and I had a note from Cohn saying he was going out in the country for a couple of weeks, he did not know where, but that he wanted to hold me to the fishing-trip in Spain we had talked about last winter.
I could reach him always, he wrote, through his bankers.
Brett was gone, I was not bothered by Cohn's troubles, I rather enjoyed not having to play tennis, there was plenty of work to do, I went often to the races, dined with friends, and put in some extra time at the office getting things ahead so I could leave it in charge of my secretary when Bill Gorton and I should shove off to Spain the end of June.
Bill Gorton arrived, put up a couple of days at the flat and went off to Vienna.
He was very cheerful and said the States were wonderful.
New York was wonderful.
There had been a grand theatrical season and a whole crop of great young light heavyweights.
Any one of them was a good prospect to grow up, put on weight and trim Dempsey.
Bill was very happy.
He had made a lot of money on his last book, and was going to make a lot more.
We had a good time while he was in Paris, and then he went off to Vienna.
He was coming back in three weeks and we would leave for Spain to get in some fishing and go to the fiesta at Pamplona.
He wrote that Vienna was wonderful.
Then a card from Budapest: "Jake, Budapest is wonderful.
" Then I got a wire: "Back on Monday.
Monday evening he turned up at the flat.
I heard his taxi stop and went to the window and called to him; he waved and started up-stairs carrying his bags.
I met him on the stairs, and took one of the bags.
"Well," I said, "I hear you had a wonderful trip."
"Wonderful," he said. "Budapest is absolutely wonderful."
"How about Vienna?"
"Not so good, Jake. Not so good. It seemed better than it was."
"How do you mean?" I was getting glasses and a siphon.
"Tight, Jake. I was tight."
"That's strange. Better have a drink."
Bill rubbed his forehead.
"Remarkable thing," he said.
"Don't know how it happened.
Suddenly it happened.
"Last long?"
"Four days, Jake. Lasted just four days."
"Where did you go?"
"Don't remember. Wrote you a post-card. Remember that perfectly."
"Do anything else?"
"Not so sure. Possible."
"Go on. Tell me about it."
"Can't remember. Tell you anything I could remember."
"Go on. Take that drink and remember."
"Might remember a little," Bill said. "Remember something about a prize-fight. Enormous Vienna prize-fight. Had a nigger in it. Remember the nigger perfectly."
"Go on."
"Wonderful nigger. Looked like Tiger Flowers, only four times as big. All of a sudden everybody started to throw things. Not me. Nigger'd just knocked local boy down. Nigger put up his glove. Wanted to make a speech. Awful noble-looking nigger. Started to make a speech. Then local white boy hit him. Then he knocked white boy cold. Then everybody commenced to throw chairs. Nigger went home with us in our car. Couldn't get his clothes. Wore my coat. Remember the whole thing now. Big sporting evening."
"What happened?"
"Loaned the nigger some clothes and went around with him to try and get his money. Claimed nigger owed them money on account of wrecking hall. Wonder who translated? Was it me?"
"Probably it wasn't you."
"You're right. Wasn't me at all. Was another fellow. Think we called him the local Harvard man. Remember him now. Studying music."
"How'd you come out?"
"Not so good, Jake. Injustice everywhere. Promoter claimed nigger promised let local boy stay. Claimed nigger violated contract. Can't knock out Vienna boy in Vienna. 'My God, Mister Gorton,' said nigger, 'I didn't do nothing in there for forty minutes but try and let him stay. That white boy musta ruptured himself swinging at me. I never did hit him.'"
"Did you get any money?"
"No money, Jake. All we could get was nigger's clothes. Somebody took his watch, too. Splendid nigger. Big mistake to have come to Vienna. Not so good, Jake. Not so good."
"What became of the nigger?"
"Went back to Cologne. Lives there. Married. Got a family. Going to write me a letter and send me the money I loaned him. Wonderful nigger. Hope I gave him the right address."
"You probably did."
"Well, anyway, let's eat," said Bill. "Unless you want me to tell you some more travel stories."
"Go on."
"Let's eat."
We went down-stairs and out onto the Boulevard St.
Michel in the warm June evening.
"Where will we go?"
"Want to eat on the island?"
"Sure."
We walked down the Boulevard.
At the juncture of the Rue Denfert-Rochereau with the Boulevard is a statue of two men in flowing robes.
"I know who they are." Bill eyed the monument. "Gentlemen who invented pharmacy. Don't try and fool me on Paris."
We went on.
"Here's a taxidermist's," Bill said. "Want to buy anything? Nice stuffed dog?"
"Come on," I said. "You're pie-eyed."
"Pretty nice stuffed dogs," Bill said. "Certainly brighten up your flat."
"Come on."
"Just one stuffed dog. I can take 'em or leave 'em alone. But listen, Jake. Just one stuffed dog."
"Come on."
"Mean everything in the world to you after you bought it. Simple exchange of values. You give them money. They give you a stuffed dog."
"We'll get one on the way back."
"All right. Have it your own way. Road to hell paved with unbought stuffed dogs. Not my fault."
We went on.
"How'd you feel that way about dogs so sudden?"
"Always felt that way about dogs. Always been a great lover of stuffed animals."
We stopped and had a drink.
"Certainly like to drink," Bill said. "You ought to try it some times, Jake."
"You're about a hundred and forty-four ahead of me."
"Ought not to daunt you. Never be daunted. Secret of my success. Never been daunted. Never been daunted in public."
"Where were you drinking?"
"Stopped at the Crillon. George made me a couple of Jack Roses. George's a great man. Know the secret of his success? Never been daunted."
"You'll be daunted after about three more pernods."
"Not in public. If I begin to feel daunted I'll go off by myself. I'm like a cat that way."
"When did you see Harvey Stone?"
"At the Crillon. Harvey was just a little daunted. Hadn't eaten for three days. Doesn't eat any more. Just goes off like a cat. Pretty sad."
"He's all right."
"Splendid. Wish he wouldn't keep going off like a cat, though. Makes me nervous."
"What'll we do to-night?"
"Doesn't make any difference. Only let's not get daunted. Suppose they got any hard-boiled eggs here? If they had hard-boiled eggs here we wouldn't have to go all the way down to the island to eat."
"Nix," I said. "We're going to have a regular meal."
"Just a suggestion," said Bill. "Want to start now?"
"Come on."
We started on again down the Boulevard.
A horse-cab passed us.
Bill looked at it.
"See that horse-cab? Going to have that horse-cab stuffed for you for Christmas. Going to give all my friends stuffed animals. I'm a nature-writer."
A taxi passed, some one in it waved, then banged for the driver to stop.
The taxi backed up to the curb.
In it was Brett.
"Beautiful lady," said Bill. "Going to kidnap us."
"Hullo!" Brett said. "Hullo!"
"This is Bill Gorton. Lady Ashley."
Brett smiled at Bill.
"I say I'm just back.
Haven't bathed even.
Michael comes in to-night.
"Good. Come on and eat with us, and we'll all go to meet him."
"Must clean myself."
"Oh, rot! Come on."
"Must bathe. He doesn't get in till nine."
"Come and have a drink, then, before you bathe."
"Might do that. Now you're not talking rot."
We got in the taxi.
The driver looked around.
"Stop at the nearest bistro," I said.
"We might as well go to the Closerie," Brett said. "I can't drink these rotten brandies."
"Closerie des Lilas."
Brett turned to Bill.
"Have you been in this pestilential city long?"
"Just got in to-day from Budapest."
"How was Budapest?"
"Wonderful. Budapest was wonderful."
"Ask him about Vienna."
"Vienna," said Bill, "is a strange city."
"Very much like Paris," Brett smiled at him, wrinkling the corners of her eyes.
"Exactly," Bill said. "Very much like Paris at this moment."
"You have a good start."
Sitting out on the terraces of the Lilas Brett ordered a whiskey and soda, I took one, too, and Bill took another pernod.
"How are you, Jake?"
"Great," I said. "I've had a good time."
Brett looked at me.
"I was a fool to go away," she said.
"One's an ass to leave Paris.
"Did you have a good time?"
"Oh, all right. Interesting. Not frightfully amusing."
"See anybody?"
"No, hardly anybody. I never went out."
"Didn't you swim?"
"No. Didn't do a thing."
"Sounds like Vienna," Bill said.
Brett wrinkled up the corners of her eyes at him.
"So that's the way it was in Vienna."
"It was like everything in Vienna."
Brett smiled at him again.
"You've a nice friend, Jake."
"He's all right," I said. "He's a taxidermist."
"That was in another country," Bill said. "And besides all the animals were dead."
"One more," Brett said, "and I must run. Do send the waiter for a taxi."
"There's a line of them. Right out in front."
"Good."
We had the drink and put Brett into her taxi.
"Mind you're at the Select around ten. Make him come. Michael will be there."
"We'll be there," Bill said. The taxi started and Brett waved.
"Quite a girl," Bill said. "She's damned nice. Who's Michael?"
"The man she's going to marry."
"Well, well," Bill said. "That's always just the stage I meet anybody. What'll I send them? Think they'd like a couple of stuffed race-horses?"
"We better eat."
"Is she really Lady something or other?" Bill asked in the taxi on our way down to the Ile Saint Louis.
"Oh, yes. In the stud-book and everything."
"Well, well."
We ate dinner at Madame Lecomte's restaurant on the far side of the island.
It was crowded with Americans and we had to stand up and wait for a place.
Some one had put it in the American Women's Club list as a quaint restaurant on the Paris quais as yet untouched by Americans, so we had to wait forty-five minutes for a table.
Bill had eaten at the restaurant in 1918, and right after the armistice, and Madame Lecomte made a great fuss over seeing him.
"Doesn't get us a table, though," Bill said. "Grand woman, though."
We had a good meal, a roast chicken, new green beans, mashed potatoes, a salad, and some apple-pie and cheese.
"You've got the world here all right," Bill said to Madame Lecomte. She raised her hand. "Oh, my God!"
"You'll be rich."
"I hope so."
After the coffee and a fine we got the bill, chalked up the same as ever on a slate, that was doubtless one of the "quaint" features, paid it, shook hands, and went out.
"You never come here any more, Monsieur Barnes," Madame Lecomte said.
"Too many compatriots."
"Come at lunch-time. It's not crowded then."
"Good. I'll be down soon."
We walked along under the trees that grew out over the river on the Quai d'Orléans side of the island.
Across the river were the broken walls of old houses that were being torn down.
"They're going to cut a street through."
"They would," Bill said.
We walked on and circled the island.
The river was dark and a bateau mouche went by, all bright with lights, going fast and quiet up and out of sight under the bridge.
Down the river was Notre Dame squatting against the night sky.
We crossed to the left bank of the Seine by the wooden foot-bridge from the Quai de Bethune, and stopped on the bridge and looked down the river at Notre Dame.
Standing on the bridge the island looked dark, the houses were high against the sky, and the trees were shadows.
"It's pretty grand," Bill said. "God, I love to get back."
We leaned on the wooden rail of the bridge and looked up the river to the lights of the big bridges.
Below the water was smooth and black.
It made no sound against the piles of the bridge.
A man and a girl passed us.
They were walking with their arms around each other.
We crossed the bridge and walked up the Rue du Cardinal Lemoine.
It was steep walking, and we went all the way up to the Place Contrescarpe.
The arc-light shone through the leaves of the trees in the square, and underneath the trees was an S bus ready to start.
Music came out of the door of the Negre Joyeux.
Through the window of the Café Aux Amateurs I saw the long zinc bar.
Outside on the terrace working people were drinking.
In the open kitchen of the Amateurs a girl was cooking potato-chips in oil.
There was an iron pot of stew.
The girl ladled some onto a plate for an old man who stood holding a bottle of red wine in one hand.
"Want to have a drink?"
"No," said Bill. "I don't need it."
We turned to the right off the Place Contrescarpe, walking along smooth narrow streets with high old houses on both sides.
Some of the houses jutted out toward the street.
Others were cut back.
We came onto the Rue du Pot de Fer and followed it along until it brought us to the rigid north and south of the Rue Saint Jacques and then walked south, past Val de Grâce, set back behind the courtyard and the iron fence, to the Boulevard du Port Royal.
"What do you want to do?" I asked. "Go up to the café and see Brett and Mike?"
"Why not?"
We walked along Port Royal until it became Montparnasse, and then on past the Lilas, Lavigne's, and all the little cafés, Damoy's, crossed the street to the Rotonde, past its lights and tables to the Select.
Michael came toward us from the tables.
He was tanned and healthy-looking.
"Hel-lo, Jake," he said. "Hel-lo! Hel-lo! How are you, old lad?"
"You look very fit, Mike."
"Oh, I am. I'm frightfully fit. I've done nothing but walk. Walk all day long. One drink a day with my mother at tea."
Bill had gone into the bar.
He was standing talking with Brett, who was sitting on a high stool, her legs crossed.
She had no stockings on.
"It's good to see you, Jake," Michael said. "I'm a little tight you know. Amazing, isn't it? Did you see my nose?"
There was a patch of dried blood on the bridge of his nose.
"An old lady's bags did that," Mike said. "I reached up to help her with them and they fell on me."
Brett gestured at him from the bar with her cigarette-holder and wrinkled the corners of her eyes.
"An old lady," said Mike. "Her bags fell on me. Let's go in and see Brett. I say, she is a piece. You are a lovely lady, Brett. Where did you get that hat?"
"Chap bought it for me. Don't you like it?"
"It's a dreadful hat. Do get a good hat."
"Oh, we've so much money now," Brett said. "I say, haven't you met Bill yet? You are a lovely host, Jake."
She turned to Mike.
"This is Bill Gorton.
This drunkard is Mike Campbell.
Campbell is an undischarged bankrupt.
"Aren't I, though? You know I met my ex-partner yesterday in London. Chap who did me in."
"What did he say?"
"Bought me a drink. I thought I might as well take it. I say, Brett, you are a lovely piece. Don't you think she's beautiful?"
"Beautiful. With this nose?"
"It's a lovely nose. Go on, point it at me. Isn't she a lovely piece?"
"Couldn't we have kept the man in Scotland?"
"I say, Brett, let's turn in early."
"Don't be indecent, Michael. Remember there are ladies at this bar."
"Isn't she a lovely piece? Don't you think so, Jake?"
"There's a fight to-night," Bill said. "Like to go?"
"Fight," said Mike. "Who's fighting?"
"Ledoux and somebody."
"He's very good, Ledoux," Mike said. "I'd like to see it, rather"--he was making an effort to pull himself together--"but I can't go. I had a date with this thing here. I say, Brett, do get a new hat."
Brett pulled the felt hat down far over one eye and smiled out from under it.
"You two run along to the fight.
I'll have to be taking Mr.
Campbell home directly.
"I'm not tight," Mike said. "Perhaps just a little. I say, Brett, you are a lovely piece."
"Go on to the fight," Brett said. "Mr. Campbell's getting difficult. What are these outbursts of affection, Michael?"
"I say, you are a lovely piece."
We said good night.
"I'm sorry I can't go," Mike said.
Brett laughed.
I looked back from the door.
Mike had one hand on the bar and was leaning toward Brett, talking.
Brett was looking at him quite coolly, but the corners of her eyes were smiling.
Outside on the pavement I said: "Do you want to go to the fight?".
"Sure," said Bill. "If we don't have to walk."
"Mike was pretty excited about his girl friend," I said in the taxi.
"Well," said Bill. "You can't blame him such a hell of a lot."
The Ledoux-Kid Francis fight was the night of the 20th of June.
It was a good fight.
The morning after the fight I had a letter from Robert Cohn, written from Hendaye.
He was having a very quiet time, he said, bathing, playing some golf and much bridge.
Hendaye had a splendid beach, but he was anxious to start on the fishing-trip.
When would I be down? If I would buy him a double-tapered line he would pay me when I came down.
That same morning I wrote Cohn from the office that Bill and I would leave Paris on the 25th unless I wired him otherwise, and would meet him at Bayonne, where we could get a bus over the mountains to Pamplona.
The same evening about seven o'clock I stopped in at the Select to see Michael and Brett.
They were not there, and I went over to the Dingo.
They were inside sitting at the bar.
"Hello, darling." Brett put out her hand.
"Hello, Jake," Mike said. "I understand I was tight last night."
"Weren't you, though," Brett said. "Disgraceful business."
"Look," said Mike, "when do you go down to Spain? Would you mind if we came down with you?"
"It would be grand."
"You wouldn't mind, really? I've been at Pamplona, you know. Brett's mad to go. You're sure we wouldn't just be a bloody nuisance?"
"Don't talk like a fool."
"I'm a little tight, you know. I wouldn't ask you like this if I weren't. You're sure you don't mind?"
"Oh, shut up, Michael," Brett said. "How can the man say he'd mind now? I'll ask him later."
"But you don't mind, do you?"
"Don't ask that again unless you want to make me sore. Bill and I go down on the morning of the 25th."
"By the way, where is Bill?" Brett asked.
"He's out at Chantilly dining with some people."
"He's a good chap."
"Splendid chap," said Mike. "He is, you know."
"You don't remember him," Brett said.
"I do. Remember him perfectly. Look, Jake, we'll come down the night of the 25th. Brett can't get up in the morning."
"Indeed not!"
"If our money comes and you're sure you don't mind."
"It will come, all right. I'll see to that."
"Tell me what tackle to send for."
"Get two or three rods with reels, and lines, and some flies."
"I won't fish," Brett put in.
"Get two rods, then, and Bill won't have to buy one."
"Right," said Mike. "I'll send a wire to the keeper."
"Won't it be splendid," Brett said. "Spain! We will have fun."
"The 25th. When is that?"
"Saturday."
"We will have to get ready."
"I say," said Mike, "I'm going to the barber's."
"I must bathe," said Brett. "Walk up to the hotel with me, Jake. Be a good chap."
"We have got the loveliest hotel," Mike said. "I think it's a brothel!"
"We left our bags here at the Dingo when we got in, and they asked us at this hotel if we wanted a room for the afternoon only. Seemed frightfully pleased we were going to stay all night."
"I believe it's a brothel," Mike said. "And I should know."
"Oh, shut it and go and get your hair cut."
Mike went out.
Brett and I sat on at the bar.
"Have another?"
"Might."
"I needed that," Brett said.
We walked up the Rue Delambre.
"I haven't seen you since I've been back," Brett said.
"No."
"How are you, Jake?"
"Fine."
Brett looked at me.
"I say," she said, "is Robert Cohn going on this trip?".
"Yes. Why?"
"Don't you think it will be a bit rough on him?"
"Why should it?"
"Who did you think I went down to San Sebastian with?"
"Congratulations," I said.
We walked along.
"What did you say that for?"
"I don't know. What would you like me to say?"
We walked along and turned a corner.
"He behaved rather well, too. He gets a little dull."
"Does he?"
"I rather thought it would be good for him."
"You might take up social service."
"Don't be nasty."
"I won't."
"Didn't you really know?"
"No," I said. "I guess I didn't think about it."
"Do you think it will be too rough on him?"
"That's up to him," I said. "Tell him you're coming. He can always not come."
"I'll write him and give him a chance to pull out of it."
I did not see Brett again until the night of the 24th of June.
"Did you hear from Cohn?"
"Rather. He's keen about it."
"My God!"
"I thought it was rather odd myself."
"Says he can't wait to see me."
"Does he think you're coming alone?"
"No. I told him we were all coming down together. Michael and all."
"He's wonderful."
"Isn't he?"
They expected their money the next day.
We arranged to meet at Pamplona.
They would go directly to San Sebastian and take the train from there.
We would all meet at the Montoya in Pamplona.
If they did not turn up on Monday at the latest we would go on ahead up to Burguete in the mountains, to start fishing.
There was a bus to Burguete.
I wrote out an itinerary so they could follow us.
Bill and I took the morning train from the Gare d'Orsay.
It was a lovely day, not too hot, and the country was beautiful from the start.
We went back into the diner and had breakfast.
Leaving the dining-car I asked the conductor for tickets for the first service.
"Nothing until the fifth."
"What's this?"
There were never more than two servings of lunch on that train, and always plenty of places for both of them.
"They're all reserved," the dining-car conductor said. "There will be a fifth service at three-thirty."
"This is serious," I said to Bill.
"Give him ten francs."
"Here," I said. "We want to eat in the first service."
The conductor put the ten francs in his pocket.
"Thank you," he said. "I would advise you gentlemen to get some sandwiches. All the places for the first four services were reserved at the office of the company."
"You'll go a long way, brother," Bill said to him in English. "I suppose if I'd given you five francs you would have advised us to jump off the train."
"Comment?"
"Go to hell!" said Bill. "Get the sandwiches made and a bottle of wine. You tell him, Jake."
"And send it up to the next car." I described where we were.
In our compartment were a man and his wife and their young son.
"I suppose you're Americans, aren't you?" the man asked. "Having a good trip?"
"Wonderful," said Bill.
"That's what you want to do. Travel while you're young. Mother and I always wanted to get over, but we had to wait a while."
"You could have come over ten years ago, if you'd wanted to," the wife said. "What you always said was: 'See America first!' I will say we've seen a good deal, take it one way and another."
"Say, there's plenty of Americans on this train," the husband said. "They've got seven cars of them from Dayton, Ohio. They've been on a pilgrimage to Rome, and now they're going down to Biarritz and Lourdes."
"So, that's what they are. Pilgrims. Goddam Puritans," Bill said.
"What part of the States you boys from?"
"Kansas City," I said. "He's from Chicago."
"You both going to Biarritz?"
"No. We're going fishing in Spain."
"Well, I never cared for it, myself. There's plenty that do out where I come from, though. We got some of the best fishing in the State of Montana. I've been out with the boys, but I never cared for it any."
"Mighty little fishing you did on them trips," his wife said.
He winked at us.
"You know how the ladies are. If there's a jug goes along, or a case of beer, they think it's hell and damnation."
"That's the way men are," his wife said to us. She smoothed her comfortable lap. "I voted against prohibition to please him, and because I like a little beer in the house, and then he talks that way. It's a wonder they ever find any one to marry them."
"Say," said Bill, "do you know that gang of Pilgrim Fathers have cornered the dining-car until half past three this afternoon?"
"How do you mean? They can't do a thing like that."
"You try and get seats."
"Well, mother, it looks as though we better go back and get another breakfast."
She stood up and straightened her dress.
"Will you boys keep an eye on our things? Come on, Hubert."
They all three went up to the wagon restaurant.
A little while after they were gone a steward went through announcing the first service, and pilgrims, with their priests, commenced filing down the corridor.
Our friend and his family did not come back.
A waiter passed in the corridor with our sandwiches and the bottle of Chablis, and we called him in.
"You're going to work to-day," I said.
He nodded his head.
"They start now, at ten-thirty.
"When do we eat?"
"Huh! When do I eat?"
He left two glasses for the bottle, and we paid him for the sandwiches and tipped him.
"I'll get the plates," he said, "or bring them with you."
We ate the sandwiches and drank the Chablis and watched the country out of the window.
The grain was just beginning to ripen and the fields were full of poppies.
The pastureland was green, and there were fine trees, and sometimes big rivers and chateaux off in the trees.
At Tours we got off and bought another bottle of wine, and when we got back in the compartment the gentleman from Montana and his wife and his son, Hubert, were sitting comfortably.
"Is there good swimming in Biarritz?" asked Hubert.
"That boy's just crazy till he can get in the water," his mother said. "It's pretty hard on youngsters travelling."
"There's good swimming," I said. "But it's dangerous when it's rough."
"Did you get a meal?" Bill asked.
"We sure did. We set right there when they started to come in, and they must have just thought we were in the party. One of the waiters said something to us in French, and then they just sent three of them back."
"They thought we were snappers, all right," the man said. "It certainly shows you the power of the Catholic Church. It's a pity you boys ain't Catholics. You could get a meal, then, all right."
"I am," I said. "That's what makes me so sore."
Finally at a quarter past four we had lunch.
Bill had been rather difficult at the last.
He buttonholed a priest who was coming back with one of the returning streams of pilgrims.
"When do us Protestants get a chance to eat, father?"
"I don't know anything about it. Haven't you got tickets?"
"It's enough to make a man join the Klan," Bill said. The priest looked back at him.
Inside the dining-car the waiters served the fifth successive table d'hôte meal.
The waiter who served us was soaked through.
His white jacket was purple under the arms.
"He must drink a lot of wine."
"Or wear purple undershirts."
"Let's ask him."
"No. He's too tired."
The train stopped for half an hour at Bordeaux and we went out through the station for a little walk.
There was not time to get in to the town.
Afterward we passed through the Landes and watched the sun set.
There were wide fire-gaps cut through the pines, and you could look up them like avenues and see wooded hills way off.
About seven-thirty we had dinner and watched the country through the open window in the diner.
It was all sandy pine country full of heather.
There were little clearings with houses in them, and once in a while we passed a sawmill.
It got dark and we could feel the country hot and sandy and dark outside of the window, and about nine o'clock we got into Bayonne.
The man and his wife and Hubert all shook hands with us.
They were going on to LaNegresse to change for Biarritz.
"Well, I hope you have lots of luck," he said.
"Be careful about those bull-fights."
"Maybe we'll see you at Biarritz," Hubert said.
We got off with our bags and rod-cases and passed through the dark station and out to the lights and the line of cabs and hotel buses.
There, standing with the hotel runners, was Robert Cohn.
He did not see us at first.
Then he started forward.
"Hello, Jake. Have a good trip?"
"Fine," I said. "This is Bill Gorton."
"How are you?"
"Come on," said Robert. "I've got a cab." He was a little near-sighted. I had never noticed it before. He was looking at Bill, trying to make him out. He was shy, too.
"We'll go up to my hotel. It's all right. It's quite nice."
We got into the cab, and the cabman put the bags up on the seat beside him and climbed up and cracked his whip, and we drove over the dark bridge and into the town.
"I'm awfully glad to meet you," Robert said to Bill. "I've heard so much about you from Jake and I've read your books. Did you get my line, Jake?"
The cab stopped in front of the hotel and we all got out and went in.
It was a nice hotel, and the people at the desk were very cheerful, and we each had a good small room.
In the morning it was bright, and they were sprinkling the streets of the town, and we all had breakfast in a café.
Bayonne is a nice town.
It is like a very clean Spanish town and it is on a big river.
Already, so early in the morning, it was very hot on the bridge across the river.
We walked out on the bridge and then took a walk through the town.
I was not at all sure Mike's rods would come from Scotland in time, so we hunted a tackle store and finally bought a rod for Bill up-stairs over a drygoods store.
The man who sold the tackle was out, and we had to wait for him to come back.
Finally he came in, and we bought a pretty good rod cheap, and two landing-nets.
We went out into the street again and took a look at the cathedral.
Cohn made some remark about it being a very good example of something or other, I forget what.
It seemed like a nice cathedral, nice and dim, like Spanish churches.
Then we went up past the old fort and out to the local Syndicat d'Initiative office, where the bus was supposed to start from.
There they told us the bus service did not start until the 1st of July.
We found out at the tourist office what we ought to pay for a motor-car to Pamplona and hired one at a big garage just around the corner from the Municipal Theatre for four hundred francs.
The car was to pick us up at the hotel in forty minutes, and we stopped at the café on the square where we had eaten breakfast, and had a beer.
It was hot, but the town had a cool, fresh, early-morning smell and it was pleasant sitting in the café.
A breeze started to blow, and you could feel that the air came from the sea.
There were pigeons out in the square, and the houses were a yellow, sun-baked color, and I did not want to leave the café.
But we had to go to the hotel to get our bags packed and pay the bill.
We paid for the beers, we matched and I think Cohn paid, and went up to the hotel.
It was only sixteen francs apiece for Bill and me, with ten per cent added for the service, and we had the bags sent down and waited for Robert Cohn.
While we were waiting I saw a cockroach on the parquet floor that must have been at least three inches long.
I pointed him out to Bill and then put my shoe on him.
We agreed he must have just come in from the garden.
It was really an awfully clean hotel.
Cohn came down, finally, and we all went out to the car.
It was a big, closed car, with a driver in a white duster with blue collar and cuffs, and we had him put the back of the car down.
He piled in the bags and we started off up the street and out of the town.
We passed some lovely gardens and had a good look back at the town, and then we were out in the country, green and rolling, and the road climbing all the time.
We passed lots of Basques with oxen, or cattle, hauling carts along the road, and nice farmhouses, low roofs, and all white-plastered.
In the Basque country the land all looks very rich and green and the houses and villages look well-off and clean.
Every village had a pelota court and on some of them kids were playing in the hot sun.
There were signs on the walls of the churches saying it was forbidden to play pelota against them, and the houses in the villages had red tiled roofs, and then the road turned off and commenced to climb and we were going way up close along a hillside, with a valley below and hills stretched off back toward the sea.
You couldn't see the sea.
It was too far away.
You could see only hills and more hills, and you knew where the sea was.
We crossed the Spanish frontier.
There was a little stream and a bridge, and Spanish carabineers, with patent-leather Bonaparte hats, and short guns on their backs, on one side, and on the other fat Frenchmen in kepis and mustaches.
They only opened one bag and took the passports in and looked at them.
There was a general store and inn on each side of the line.
The chauffeur had to go in and fill out some papers about the car and we got out and went over to the stream to see if there were any trout.
Bill tried to talk some Spanish to one of the carabineers, but it did not go very well.
Robert Cohn asked, pointing with his finger, if there were any trout in the stream, and the carabineer said yes, but not many.
I asked him if he ever fished, and he said no, that he didn't care for it.
Just then an old man with long, sunburned hair and beard, and clothes that looked as though they were made of gunny-sacking, came striding up to the bridge.
He was carrying a long staff, and he had a kid slung on his back, tied by the four legs, the head hanging down.
The carabineer waved him back with his sword.
The man turned without saying anything, and started back up the white road into Spain.
"What's the matter with the old one?" I asked.
"He hasn't got any passport."
I offered the guard a cigarette.
He took it and thanked me.
"What will he do?" I asked.
The guard spat in the dust.
"Oh, he'll just wade across the stream."
"Do you have much smuggling?"
"Oh," he said, "they go through."
The chauffeur came out, folding up the papers and putting them in the inside pocket of his coat.
We all got in the car and it started up the white dusty road into Spain.
For a while the country was much as it had been; then, climbing all the time, we crossed the top of a Col, the road winding back and forth on itself, and then it was really Spain.
There were long brown mountains and a few pines and far-off forests of beech-trees on some of the mountainsides.
The road went along the summit of the Col and then dropped down, and the driver had to honk, and slow up, and turn out to avoid running into two donkeys that were sleeping in the road.
We came down out of the mountains and through an oak forest, and there were white cattle grazing in the forest.
Down below there were grassy plains and clear streams, and then we crossed a stream and went through a gloomy little village, and started to climb again.
We climbed up and up and crossed another high Col and turned along it, and the road ran down to the right, and we saw a whole new range of mountains off to the south, all brown and baked-looking and furrowed in strange shapes.
After a while we came out of the mountains, and there were trees along both sides of the road, and a stream and ripe fields of grain, and the road went on, very white and straight ahead, and then lifted to a little rise, and off on the left was a hill with an old castle, with buildings close around it and a field of grain going right up to the walls and shifting in the wind.
I was up in front with the driver and I turned around.
Robert Cohn was asleep, but Bill looked and nodded his head.
Then we crossed a wide plain, and there was a big river off on the right shining in the sun from between the line of trees, and away off you could see the plateau of Pamplona rising out of the plain, and the walls of the city, and the great brown cathedral, and the broken skyline of the other churches.
In back of the plateau were the mountains, and every way you looked there were other mountains, and ahead the road stretched out white across the plain going toward Pamplona.
We came into the town on the other side of the plateau, the road slanting up steeply and dustily with shade-trees on both sides, and then levelling out through the new part of town they are building up outside the old walls.
We passed the bull-ring, high and white and concrete-looking in the sun, and then came into the big square by a side street and stopped in front of the Hotel Montoya.
The driver helped us down with the bags.
There was a crowd of kids watching the car, and the square was hot, and the trees were green, and the flags hung on their staffs, and it was good to get out of the sun and under the shade of the arcade that runs all the way around the square.
Montoya was glad to see us, and shook hands and gave us good rooms looking out on the square, and then we washed and cleaned up and went down-stairs in the dining-room for lunch.
The driver stayed for lunch, too, and afterward we paid him and he started back to Bayonne.
There are two dining-rooms in the Montoya.
One is up-stairs on the second floor and looks out on the square.
The other is down one floor below the level of the square and has a door that opens on the back street that the bulls pass along when they run through the streets early in the morning on their way to the ring.
It is always cool in the down-stairs dining-room and we had a very good lunch.
The first meal in Spain was always a shock with the hors d'oeuvres, an egg course, two meat courses, vegetables, salad, and dessert and fruit.
You have to drink plenty of wine to get it all down.
Robert Cohn tried to say he did not want any of the second meat course, but we would not interpret for him, and so the waitress brought him something else as a replacement, a plate of cold meats, I think.
Cohn had been rather nervous ever since we had met at Bayonne.
He did not know whether we knew Brett had been with him at San Sebastian, and it made him rather awkward.
"Well," I said, "Brett and Mike ought to get in to-night."
"I'm not sure they'll come," Cohn said.
"Why not?" Bill said. "Of course they'll come."
"They're always late," I said.
"I rather think they're not coming," Robert Cohn said.
He said it with an air of superior knowledge that irritated both of us.
"I'll bet you fifty pesetas they're here to-night," Bill said. He always bets when he is angered, and so he usually bets foolishly.
"I'll take it," Cohn said. "Good. You remember it, Jake. Fifty pesetas."
"I'll remember it myself," Bill said. I saw he was angry and wanted to smooth him down.
"It's a sure thing they'll come," I said. "But maybe not to-night."
"Want to call it off?" Cohn asked.
"No. Why should I? Make it a hundred if you like."
"All right. I'll take that."
"That's enough," I said. "Or you'll have to make a book and give me some of it."
"I'm satisfied," Cohn said. He smiled. "You'll probably win it back at bridge, anyway."
"You haven't got it yet," Bill said.
We went out to walk around under the arcade to the Café Iruña for coffee.
Cohn said he was going over and get a shave.
"Say," Bill said to me, "have I got any chance on that bet?"
"You've got a rotten chance. They've never been on time anywhere. If their money doesn't come it's a cinch they won't get in to-night."
"I was sorry as soon as I opened my mouth. But I had to call him. He's all right, I guess, but where does he get this inside stuff? Mike and Brett fixed it up with us about coming down here."
I saw Cohn coming over across the square.
"Here he comes."
"Well, let him not get superior and Jewish."
"The barber shop's closed," Cohn said. "It's not open till four."
We had coffee at the Iruña, sitting in comfortable wicker chairs looking out from the cool of the arcade at the big square.
After a while Bill went to write some letters and Cohn went over to the barber-shop.
It was still closed, so he decided to go up to the hotel and get a bath, and I sat out in front of the café and then went for a walk in the town.
It was very hot, but I kept on the shady side of the streets and went through the market and had a good time seeing the town again.
I went to the Ayuntamiento and found the old gentleman who subscribes for the bull-fight tickets for me every year, and he had gotten the money I sent him from Paris and renewed my subscriptions, so that was all set.
He was the archivist, and all the archives of the town were in his office.
That has nothing to do with the story.
Anyway, his office had a green baize door and a big wooden door, and when I went out I left him sitting among the archives that covered all the walls, and I shut both the doors, and as I went out of the building into the street the porter stopped me to brush off my coat.
"You must have been in a motor-car," he said.
The back of the collar and the upper part of the shoulders were gray with dust.
"From Bayonne."
"Well, well," he said. "I knew you were in a motor-car from the way the dust was." So I gave him two copper coins.
At the end of the street I saw the cathedral and walked up toward it.
The first time I ever saw it I thought the façade was ugly but I liked it now.
I went inside.
It was dim and dark and the pillars went high up, and there were people praying, and it smelt of incense, and there were some wonderful big windows.
I knelt and started to pray and prayed for everybody I thought of, Brett and Mike and Bill and Robert Cohn and myself, and all the bull-fighters, separately for the ones I liked, and lumping all the rest, then I prayed for myself again, and while I was praying for myself I found I was getting sleepy, so I prayed that the bull-fights would be good, and that it would be a fine fiesta, and that we would get some fishing.
I wondered if there was anything else I might pray for, and I thought I would like to have some money, so I prayed that I would make a lot of money, and then I started to think how I would make it, and thinking of making money reminded me of the count, and I started wondering about where he was, and regretting I hadn't seen him since that night in Montmartre, and about something funny Brett told me about him, and as all the time I was kneeling with my forehead on the wood in front of me, and was thinking of myself as praying, I was a little ashamed, and regretted that I was such a rotten Catholic, but realized there was nothing I could do about it, at least for a while, and maybe never, but that anyway it was a grand religion, and I only wished I felt religious and maybe I would the next time; and then I was out in the hot sun on the steps of the cathedral, and the forefingers and the thumb of my right hand were still damp, and I felt them dry in the sun.
The sunlight was hot and hard, and I crossed over beside some buildings, and walked back along side-streets to the hotel.
At dinner that night we found that Robert Cohn had taken a bath, had had a shave and a haircut and a shampoo, and something put on his hair afterward to make it stay down.
He was nervous, and I did not try to help him any.
The train was due in at nine o'clock from San Sebastian, and, if Brett and Mike were coming, they would be on it.
At twenty minutes to nine we were not half through dinner.
Robert Cohn got up from the table and said he would go to the station.
I said I would go with him, just to devil him.
Bill said he would be damned if he would leave his dinner.
I said we would be right back.
We walked to the station.
I was enjoying Cohn's nervousness.
I hoped Brett would be on the train.
At the station the train was late, and we sat on a baggage-truck and waited outside in the dark.
I have never seen a man in civil life as nervous as Robert Cohn--nor as eager.
I was enjoying it.
It was lousy to enjoy it, but I felt lousy.
Cohn had a wonderful quality of bringing out the worst in anybody.
After a while we heard the train-whistle way off below on the other side of the plateau, and then we saw the headlight coming up the hill.
We went inside the station and stood with a crowd of people just back of the gates, and the train came in and stopped, and everybody started coming out through the gates.
They were not in the crowd.
We waited till everybody had gone through and out of the station and gotten into buses, or taken cabs, or were walking with their friends or relatives through the dark into the town.
"I knew they wouldn't come," Robert said. We were going back to the hotel.
"I thought they might," I said.
Bill was eating fruit when we came in and finishing a bottle of wine.
"Didn't come, eh?"
"No."
"Do you mind if I give you that hundred pesetas in the morning, Cohn?" Bill asked. "I haven't changed any money here yet."
"Oh, forget about it," Robert Cohn said. "Let's bet on something else. Can you bet on bull-fights?"
"You could," Bill said, "but you don't need to."
"It would be like betting on the war," I said. "You don't need any economic interest."
"I'm very curious to see them," Robert said.
Montoya came up to our table.
He had a telegram in his hand.
"It's for you.
" He handed it to me.
It read: "Stopped night San Sebastian.
"It's from them," I said. I put it in my pocket. Ordinarily I should have handed it over.
"They've stopped over in San Sebastian," I said. "Send their regards to you."
Why I felt that impulse to devil him I do not know.
Of course I do know.
I was blind, unforgivingly jealous of what had happened to him.
The fact that I took it as a matter of course did not alter that any.
I certainly did hate him.
I do not think I ever really hated him until he had that little spell of superiority at lunch--that and when he went through all that barbering.
So I put the telegram in my pocket.
The telegram came to me, anyway.
"Well," I said. "We ought to pull out on the noon bus for Burguete. They can follow us if they get in to-morrow night."
There were only two trains up from San Sebastian, an early morning train and the one we had just met.
"That sounds like a good idea," Cohn said.
"The sooner we get on the stream the better."
"It's all one to me when we start," Bill said. "The sooner the better."
We sat in the Iruña for a while and had coffee and then took a little walk out to the bull-ring and across the field and under the trees at the edge of the cliff and looked down at the river in the dark, and I turned in early.
Bill and Cohn stayed out in the café quite late, I believe, because I was asleep when they came in.
In the morning I bought three tickets for the bus to Burguete.
It was scheduled to leave at two o'clock.
There was nothing earlier.
I was sitting over at the Iruña reading the papers when I saw Robert Cohn coming across the square.
He came up to the table and sat down in one of the wicker chairs.
"This is a comfortable café," he said. "Did you have a good night, Jake?"
"I slept like a log."
"I didn't sleep very well. Bill and I were out late, too."
"Where were you?"
"Here. And after it shut we went over to that other café. The old man there speaks German and English."
"The Café Suizo."
"That's it. He seems like a nice old fellow. I think it's a better café than this one."
"It's not so good in the daytime," I said. "Too hot. By the way, I got the bus tickets."
"I'm not going up to-day. You and Bill go on ahead."
"I've got your ticket."
"Give it to me. I'll get the money back."
"It's five pesetas."
Robert Cohn took out a silver five-peseta piece and gave it to me.
"I ought to stay," he said. "You see I'm afraid there's some sort of misunderstanding."
"Why," I said. "They may not come here for three or four days now if they start on parties at San Sebastian."
"That's just it," said Robert. "I'm afraid they expected to meet me at San Sebastian, and that's why they stopped over."
"What makes you think that?"
"Well, I wrote suggesting it to Brett."
"Why in hell didn't you stay there and meet them then?" I started to say, but I stopped. I thought that idea would come to him by itself, but I do not believe it ever did.
He was being confidential now and it was giving him pleasure to be able to talk with the understanding that I knew there was something between him and Brett.
"Well, Bill and I will go up right after lunch," I said.
"I wish I could go. We've been looking forward to this fishing all winter." He was being sentimental about it. "But I ought to stay. I really ought. As soon as they come I'll bring them right up."
"Let's find Bill."
"I want to go over to the barber-shop."
"See you at lunch."
I found Bill up in his room.
He was shaving.
"Oh, yes, he told me all about it last night," Bill said. "He's a great little confider. He said he had a date with Brett at San Sebastian."
"The lying bastard!"
"Oh, no," said Bill. "Don't get sore. Don't get sore at this stage of the trip. How did you ever happen to know this fellow, anyway?"
"Don't rub it in."
Bill looked around, half-shaved, and then went on talking into the mirror while he lathered his face.
"Didn't you send him with a letter to me in New York last winter? Thank God, I'm a travelling man. Haven't you got some more Jewish friends you could bring along?" He rubbed his chin with his thumb, looked at it, and then started scraping again.
"You've got some fine ones yourself."
"Oh, yes. I've got some darbs. But not alongside of this Robert Cohn. The funny thing is he's nice, too. I like him. But he's just so awful."
"He can be damn nice."
"I know it. That's the terrible part."
I laughed.
"Yes. Go on and laugh," said Bill. "You weren't out with him last night until two o'clock."
"Was he very bad?"
"Awful. What's all this about him and Brett, anyway? Did she ever have anything to do with him?"
He raised his chin up and pulled it from side to side.
"Sure. She went down to San Sebastian with him."
"What a damn-fool thing to do. Why did she do that?"
"She wanted to get out of town and she can't go anywhere alone. She said she thought it would be good for him."
"What bloody-fool things people do. Why didn't she go off with some of her own people? Or you?"--he slurred that over--"or me? Why not me?" He looked at his face carefully in the glass, put a big dab of lather on each cheek-bone. "It's an honest face. It's a face any woman would be safe with."
"She'd never seen it."
"She should have. All women should see it. It's a face that ought to be thrown on every screen in the country. Every woman ought to be given a copy of this face as she leaves the altar. Mothers should tell their daughters about this face. My son"--he pointed the razor at me--"go west with this face and grow up with the country."
He ducked down to the bowl, rinsed his face with cold water, put on some alcohol, and then looked at himself carefully in the glass, pulling down his long upper lip.
"My God!" he said, "isn't it an awful face?"
He looked in the glass.
"And as for this Robert Cohn," Bill said, "he makes me sick, and he can go to hell, and I'm damn glad he's staying here so we won't have him fishing with us."
"You're damn right."
"We're going trout-fishing. We're going trout-fishing in the Irati River, and we're going to get tight now at lunch on the wine of the country, and then take a swell bus ride."
"Come on. Let's go over to the Iruña and start," I said.
It was baking hot in the square when we came out after lunch with our bags and the rod-case to go to Burguete.
People were on top of the bus, and others were climbing up a ladder.
Bill went up and Robert sat beside Bill to save a place for me, and I went back in the hotel to get a couple of bottles of wine to take with us.
When I came out the bus was crowded.
Men and women were sitting on all the baggage and boxes on top, and the women all had their fans going in the sun.
It certainly was hot.
Robert climbed down and I fitted into the place he had saved on the one wooden seat that ran across the top.
Robert Cohn stood in the shade of the arcade waiting for us start.
A Basque with a big leather wine-bag in his lap lay across the top of the bus in front of our seat, leaning back against our legs.
He offered the wine-skin to Bill and to me, and when I tipped it up to drink he imitated the sound of a klaxon motor-horn so well and so suddenly that I spilled some of the wine, and everybody laughed.
He apologized and made me take another drink.
He made the klaxon again a little later, and it fooled me the second time.
He was very good at it.
The Basques liked it.
The man next to Bill was talking to him in Spanish and Bill was not getting it, so he offered the man one of the bottles of wine.
The man waved it away.
He said it was too hot and he had drunk too much at lunch.
When Bill offered the bottle the second time he took a long drink, and then the bottle went all over that part of the bus.
Every one took a drink very politely, and then they made us cork it up and put it away.
They all wanted us to drink from their leather wine-bottles.
They were peasants going up into the hills.
Finally, after a couple more false klaxons, the bus started, and Robert Cohn waved good-by to us, and all the Basques waved good-by to him.
As soon as we started out on the road outside of town it was cool.
It felt nice riding high up and close under the trees.
The bus went quite fast and made a good breeze, and as we went out along the road with the dust powdering the trees and down the hill, we had a fine view, back through the trees, of the town rising up from the bluff above the river.
The Basque lying against my knees pointed out the view with the neck of the wine-bottle, and winked at us.
He nodded his head.
"Pretty nice, eh?"
"These Basques are swell people," Bill said.
The Basque lying against my legs was tanned the color of saddle-leather.
He wore a black smock like all the rest.
There were wrinkles in his tanned neck.
He turned around and offered his wine-bag to Bill.
Bill handed him one of our bottles.
The Basque wagged a forefinger at him and handed the bottle back, slapping in the cork with the palm of his hand.
He shoved the wine-bag up.
"Arriba! Arriba!" he said. "Lift it up."
Bill raised the wine-skin and let the stream of wine spurt out and into his mouth, his head tipped back.
When he stopped drinking and tipped the leather bottle down a few drops ran down his chin.
"No! No!" several Basques said. "Not like that." One snatched the bottle away from the owner, who was himself about to give a demonstration. He was a young fellow and he held the wine-bottle at full arms' length and raised it high up, squeezing the leather bag with his hand so the stream of wine hissed into his mouth. He held the bag out there, the wine making a flat, hard trajectory into his mouth, and he kept on swallowing smoothly and regularly.
"Hey!" the owner of the bottle shouted. "Whose wine is that?"
The drinker waggled his little finger at him and smiled at us with his eyes.
Then he bit the stream off sharp, made a quick lift with the wine-bag and lowered it down to the owner.
He winked at us.
The owner shook the wine-skin sadly.
We passed through a town and stopped in front of the posada, and the driver took on several packages.
Then we started on again, and outside the town the road commenced to mount.
We were going through farming country with rocky hills that sloped down into the fields.
The grain-fields went up the hillsides.
Now as we went higher there was a wind blowing the grain.
The road was white and dusty, and the dust rose under the wheels and hung in the air behind us.
The road climbed up into the hills and left the rich grain-fields below.
Now there were only patches of grain on the bare hillsides and on each side of the water-courses.
We turned sharply out to the side of the road to give room to pass to a long string of six mules, following one after the other, hauling a high-hooded wagon loaded with freight.
The wagon and the mules were covered with dust.
Close behind was another string of mules and another wagon.
This was loaded with lumber, and the arriero driving the mules leaned back and put on the thick wooden brakes as we passed.
Up here the country was quite barren and the hills were rocky and hard-baked clay furrowed by the rain.
We came around a curve into a town, and on both sides opened out a sudden green valley.
A stream went through the centre of the town and fields of grapes touched the houses.
The bus stopped in front of a posada and many of the passengers got down, and a lot of the baggage was unstrapped from the roof from under the big tarpaulins and lifted down.
Bill and I got down and went into the posada.
There was a low, dark room with saddles and harness, and hay-forks made of white wood, and clusters of canvas rope-soled shoes and hams and slabs of bacon and white garlics and long sausages hanging from the roof.
It was cool and dusky, and we stood in front of a long wooden counter with two women behind it serving drinks.
Behind them were shelves stacked with supplies and goods.
We each had an aguardiente and paid forty centimes for the two drinks.
I gave the woman fifty centimes to make a tip, and she gave me back the copper piece, thinking I had misunderstood the price.
Two of our Basques came in and insisted on buying a drink.
So they bought a drink and then we bought a drink, and then they slapped us on the back and bought another drink.
Then we bought, and then we all went out into the sunlight and the heat, and climbed back on top of the bus.
There was plenty of room now for every one to sit on the seat, and the Basque who had been lying on the tin roof now sat between us.
The woman who had been serving drinks came out wiping her hands on her apron and talked to somebody inside the bus.
Then the driver came out swinging two flat leather mail-pouches and climbed up, and everybody waving we started off.
The road left the green valley at once, and we were up in the hills again.
Bill and the wine-bottle Basque were having a conversation.
A man leaned over from the other side of the seat and asked in English: "You're Americans?".
"Sure."
"I been there," he said. "Forty years ago."
He was an old man, as brown as the others, with the stubble of a white beard.
"How was it?"
"What you say?"
"How was America?"
"Oh, I was in California. It was fine."
"Why did you leave?"
"What you say?"
"Why did you come back here?"
"Oh! I come back to get married. I was going to go back but my wife she don't like to travel. Where you from?"
"Kansas City."
"I been there," he said. "I been in Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Denver, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City."
He named them carefully.
"How long were you over?"
"Fifteen years. Then I come back and got married."
"Have a drink?"
"All right," he said. "You can't get this in America, eh?"
"There's plenty if you can pay for it."
"What you come over here for?"
"We're going to the fiesta at Pamplona."
"You like the bull-fights?"
"Sure. Don't you?"
"Yes," he said. "I guess I like them."
Then after a little:.
"Where you go now?"
"Up to Burguete to fish."
"Well," he said, "I hope you catch something."
He shook hands and turned around to the back seat again.
The other Basques had been impressed.
He sat back comfortably and smiled at me when I turned around to look at the country.
But the effort of talking American seemed to have tired him.
He did not say anything after that.
The bus climbed steadily up the road.
The country was barren and rocks stuck up through the clay.
There was no grass beside the road.
Looking back we could see the country spread out below.
Far back the fields were squares of green and brown on the hillsides.
Making the horizon were the brown mountains.
They were strangely shaped.
As we climbed higher the horizon kept changing.
As the bus ground slowly up the road we could see other mountains coming up in the south.
Then the road came over the crest, flattened out, and went into a forest.
It was a forest of cork oaks, and the sun came through the trees in patches, and there were cattle grazing back in the trees.
We went through the forest and the road came out and turned along a rise of land, and out ahead of us was a rolling green plain, with dark mountains beyond it.
These were not like the brown, heat-baked mountains we had left behind.
These were wooded and there were clouds coming down from them.
The green plain stretched off.
It was cut by fences and the white of the road showed through the trunks of a double line of trees that crossed the plain toward the north.
As we came to the edge of the rise we saw the red roofs and white houses of Burguete ahead strung out on the plain, and away off on the shoulder of the first dark mountain was the gray metal-sheathed roof of the monastery of Roncesvalles.
"There's Roncevaux," I said.
"Where?"
"Way off there where the mountain starts."
"It's cold up here," Bill said.
"It's high," I said. "It must be twelve hundred metres."
"It's awful cold," Bill said.
The bus levelled down onto the straight line of road that ran to Burguete.
We passed a crossroads and crossed a bridge over a stream.
The houses of Burguete were along both sides of the road.
There were no side-streets.
We passed the church and the school-yard, and the bus stopped.
We got down and the driver handed down our bags and the rod-case.
A carabineer in his cocked hat and yellow leather cross-straps came up.
"What's in there?" he pointed to the rod-case.
I opened it and showed him.
He asked to see our fishing permits and I got them out.
He looked at the date and then waved us on.
"Is that all right?" I asked.
"Yes. Of course."
We went up the street, past the whitewashed stone houses, families sitting in their doorways watching us, to the inn.
The fat woman who ran the inn came out from the kitchen and shook hands with us.
She took off her spectacles, wiped them, and put them on again.
It was cold in the inn and the wind was starting to blow outside.
The woman sent a girl up-stairs with us to show the room.
There were two beds, a washstand, a clothes-chest, and a big, framed steel-engraving of Nuestra Señora de Roncesvalles.
The wind was blowing against the shutters.
The room was on the north side of the inn.
We washed, put on sweaters, and came down-stairs into the dining-room.
It had a stone floor, low ceiling, and was oak-panelled.
The shutters were up and it was so cold you could see your breath.
"My God!" said Bill. "It can't be this cold to-morrow. I'm not going to wade a stream in this weather."
There was an upright piano in the far corner of the room beyond the wooden tables and Bill went over and started to play.
"I got to keep warm," he said.
I went out to find the woman and ask her how much the room and board was.
She put her hands under her apron and looked away from me.
"Twelve pesetas."
"Why, we only paid that in Pamplona."
She did not say anything, just took off her glasses and wiped them on her apron.
"That's too much," I said. "We didn't pay more than that at a big hotel."
"We've put in a bathroom."
"Haven't you got anything cheaper?"
"Not in the summer. Now is the big season."
We were the only people in the inn.
Well, I thought, it's only a few days.
"Is the wine included?"
"Oh, yes."
"Well," I said. "It's all right."
I went back to Bill.
He blew his breath at me to show how cold it was, and went on playing.
I sat at one of the tables and looked at the pictures on the wall.
There was one panel of rabbits, dead, one of pheasants, also dead, and one panel of dead ducks.
The panels were all dark and smoky-looking.
There was a cupboard full of liqueur bottles.
I looked at them all.
Bill was still playing.
"How about a hot rum punch?" he said.
"This isn't going to keep me warm permanently.
I went out and told the woman what a rum punch was and how to make it.
In a few minutes a girl brought a stone pitcher, steaming, into the room.
Bill came over from the piano and we drank the hot punch and listened to the wind.
"There isn't too much rum in that."
I went over to the cupboard and brought the rum bottle and poured a half-tumblerful into the pitcher.
"Direct action," said Bill. "It beats legislation."
The girl came in and laid the table for supper.
"It blows like hell up here," Bill said.
The girl brought in a big bowl of hot vegetable soup and the wine.
We had fried trout afterward and some sort of a stew and a big bowl full of wild strawberries.
We did not lose money on the wine, and the girl was shy but nice about bringing it The old woman looked in once and counted the empty bottles.
After supper we went up-stairs and smoked and read in bed to keep warm.
Once in the night I woke and heard the wind blowing.
It felt good to be warm and in bed.
When I woke in the morning I went to the window and looked out.
It had cleared and there were no clouds on the mountains.
Outside under the window were some carts and an old diligence, the wood of the roof cracked and split by the weather.
It must have been left from the days before the motor-buses.
A goat hopped up on one of the carts and then to the roof of the diligence.
He jerked his head at the other goats below and when I waved at him he bounded down.
Bill was still sleeping, so I dressed, put on my shoes outside in the hall, and went down-stairs.
No one was stirring down-stairs, so I unbolted the door and went out.
It was cool outside in the early morning and the sun had not yet dried the dew that had come when the wind died down.
I hunted around in the shed behind the inn and found a sort of mattock, and went down toward the stream to try and dig some worms for bait.
The stream was clear and shallow but it did not look trouty.
On the grassy bank where it was damp I drove the mattock into the earth and loosened a chunk of sod.
There were worms underneath.
They slid out of sight as I lifted the sod and I dug carefully and got a good many.
Digging at the edge of the damp ground I filled two empty tobacco-tins with worms and sifted dirt onto them.
The goats watched me dig.
When I went back into the inn the woman was down in the kitchen, and I asked her to get coffee for us, and that we wanted a lunch.
Bill was awake and sitting on the edge of the bed.
"I saw you out of the window," he said. "Didn't want to interrupt you. What were you doing? Burying your money?"
"You lazy bum!"
"Been working for the common good? Splendid. I want you to do that every morning."
"Come on," I said. "Get up."
"What? Get up? I never get up."
He climbed into bed and pulled the sheet up to his chin.
"Try and argue me into getting up."
I went on looking for the tackle and putting it all together in the tackle-bag.
"Aren't you interested?" Bill asked.
"I'm going down and eat."
"Eat? Why didn't you say eat? I thought you just wanted me to get up for fun. Eat? Fine. Now you're reasonable. You go out and dig some more worms and I'll be right down."
"Oh, go to hell!"
"Work for the good of all." Bill stepped into his underclothes. "Show irony and pity."
I started out of the room with the tackle-bag, the nets, and the rod-case.
"Hey! come back!"
I put my head in the door.
"Aren't you going to show a little irony and pity?"
I thumbed my nose.
"That's not irony."
As I went down-stairs I heard Bill singing, "Irony and Pity.
When you're feeling.
Oh, Give them Irony and Give them Pity.
Oh, give them Irony.
When they're feeling.
Just a little irony.
Just a little pity.
" He kept on singing until he came down-stairs.
The tune was: "The Bells are Ringing for Me and my Gal.
" I was reading a week-old Spanish paper.
"What's all this irony and pity?"
"What? Don't you know about Irony and Pity?"
"No. Who got it up?"
"Everybody. They're mad about it in New York. It's just like the Fratellinis used to be."
The girl came in with the coffee and buttered toast.
Or, rather, it was bread toasted and buttered.
"Ask her if she's got any jam," Bill said. "Be ironical with her."
"Have you got any jam?"
"That's not ironical. I wish I could talk Spanish."
The coffee was good and we drank it out of big bowls.
The girl brought in a glass dish of raspberry jam.
"Thank you."
"Hey! that's not the way," Bill said. "Say something ironical. Make some crack about Primo de Rivera."
"I could ask her what kind of a jam they think they've gotten into in the Riff."
"Poor," said Bill. "Very poor. You can't do it. That's all. You don't understand irony. You have no pity. Say something pitiful."
"Robert Cohn."
"Not so bad. That's better. Now why is Cohn pitiful? Be ironic."
He took a big gulp of coffee.
"Aw, hell!" I said. "It's too early in the morning."
"There you go. And you claim you want to be a writer, too. You're only a newspaper man. An expatriated newspaper man. You ought to be ironical the minute you get out of bed. You ought to wake up with your mouth full of pity."
"Go on," I said. "Who did you get this stuff from?"
"Everybody. Don't you read? Don't you ever see anybody? You know what you are? You're an expatriate. Why don't you live in New York? Then you'd know these things. What do you want me to do? Come over here and tell you every year?"
"Take some more coffee," I said.
"Good. Coffee is good for you. It's the caffeine in it. Caffeine, we are here. Caffeine puts a man on her horse and a woman in his grave. You know what's the trouble with you? You're an expatriate. One of the worst type. Haven't you heard that? Nobody that ever left their own country ever wrote anything worth printing. Not even in the newspapers."
He drank the coffee.
"You're an expatriate. You've lost touch with the soil. You get precious. Fake European standards have ruined you. You drink yourself to death. You become obsessed by sex. You spend all your time talking, not working. You are an expatriate, see? You hang around cafés."
"It sounds like a swell life," I said. "When do I work?"
"You don't work. One group claims women support you. Another group claims you're impotent."
"No," I said. "I just had an accident."
"Never mention that," Bill said. "That's the sort of thing that can't be spoken of. That's what you ought to work up into a mystery. Like Henry's bicycle."
He had been going splendidly, but he stopped.
I was afraid he thought he had hurt me with that crack about being impotent.
I wanted to start him again.
"It wasn't a bicycle," I said. "He was riding horseback."
"I heard it was a tricycle."
"Well," I said. "A plane is sort of like a tricycle. The joystick works the same way."
"But you don't pedal it."
"No," I said, "I guess you don't pedal it."
"Let's lay off that," Bill said.
"All right. I was just standing up for the tricycle."
"I think he's a good writer, too," Bill said. "And you're a hell of a good guy. Anybody ever tell you you were a good guy?"
"I'm not a good guy."
"Listen. You're a hell of a good guy, and I'm fonder of you than anybody on earth. I couldn't tell you that in New York. It'd mean I was a faggot. That was what the Civil War was about. Abraham Lincoln was a faggot. He was in love with General Grant. So was Jefferson Davis. Lincoln just freed the slaves on a bet. The Dred Scott case was framed by the Anti-Saloon League. Sex explains it all. The Colonel's Lady and Judy O'Grady are Lesbians under their skin."
He stopped.
"Want to hear some more?"
"Shoot," I said.
"I don't know any more. Tell you some more at lunch."
"Old Bill," I said.
"You bum!"
We packed the lunch and two bottles of wine in the rucksack, and Bill put it on.
I carried the rod-case and the landing-nets slung over my back.
We started up the road and then went across a meadow and found a path that crossed the fields and went toward the woods on the slope of the first hill.
We walked across the fields on the sandy path.
The fields were rolling and grassy and the grass was short from the sheep grazing.
The cattle were up in the hills.
We heard their bells in the woods.
The path crossed a stream on a foot-log.
The log was surfaced off, and there was a sapling bent across for a rail.
In the flat pool beside the stream tadpoles spotted the sand.
We went up a steep bank and across the rolling fields.
Looking back we saw Burguete, white houses and red roofs, and the white road with a truck going along it and the dust rising.
Beyond the fields we crossed another faster-flowing stream.
A sandy road led down to the ford and beyond into the woods.
The path crossed the stream on another foot-log below the ford, and joined the road, and we went into the woods.
It was a beech wood and the trees were very old.
Their roots bulked above the ground and the branches were twisted.
We walked on the road between the thick trunks of the old beeches and the sunlight came through the leaves in light patches on the grass.
The trees were big, and the foliage was thick but it was not gloomy.
There was no undergrowth, only the smooth grass, very green and fresh, and the big gray trees well spaced as though it were a park.
"This is country," Bill said.
The road went up a hill and we got into thick woods, and the road kept on climbing.
Sometimes it dipped down but rose again steeply.
All the time we heard the cattle in the woods.
Finally, the road came out on the top of the hills.
We were on the top of the height of land that was the highest part of the range of wooded hills we had seen from Burguete.
There were wild strawberries growing on the sunny side of the ridge in a little clearing in the trees.
Ahead the road came out of the forest and went along the shoulder of the ridge of hills.
The hills ahead were not wooded, and there were great fields of yellow gorse.
Way off we saw the steep bluffs, dark with trees and jutting with gray stone, that marked the course of the Irati River.
"We have to follow this road along the ridge, cross these hills, go through the woods on the far hills, and come down to the Irati valley," I pointed out to Bill.
"That's a hell of a hike."
"It's too far to go and fish and come back the same day, comfortably."
"Comfortably. That's a nice word. We'll have to go like hell to get there and back and have any fishing at all."
It was a long walk and the country was very fine, but we were tired when we came down the steep road that led out of the wooded hills into the valley of the Rio de la Fabrica.
The road came out from the shadow of the woods into the hot sun.
Ahead was a river-valley.
Beyond the river was a steep hill.
There was a field of buckwheat on the hill.
We saw a white house under some trees on the hillside.
It was very hot and we stopped under some trees beside a dam that crossed the river.
Bill put the pack against one of the trees and we jointed up the rods, put on the reels, tied on leaders, and got ready to fish.
"You're sure this thing has trout in it?" Bill asked.
"It's full of them."
"I'm going to fish a fly. You got any McGintys?"
"There's some in there."
"You going to fish bait?"
"Yeah. I'm going to fish the dam here."
"Well, I'll take the fly-book, then." He tied on a fly. "Where'd I better go? Up or down?"
"Down is the best. They're plenty up above, too."
Bill went down the bank.
"Take a worm can."
"No, I don't want one. If they won't take a fly I'll just flick it around."
Bill was down below watching the stream.
"Say," he called up against the noise of the dam. "How about putting the wine in that spring up the road?"
"All right," I shouted. Bill waved his hand and started down the stream. I found the two wine-bottles in the pack, and carried them up the road to where the water of a spring flowed out of an iron pipe. There was a board over the spring and I lifted it and, knocking the corks firmly into the bottles, lowered them down into the water. It was so cold my hand and wrist felt numbed. I put back the slab of wood, and hoped nobody would find the wine.
I got my rod that was leaning against the tree, took the bait-can and landing-net, and walked out onto the dam.
It was built to provide a head of water for driving logs.
The gate was up, and I sat on one of the squared timbers and watched the smooth apron of water before the river tumbled into the falls.
In the white water at the foot of the dam it was deep.
As I baited up, a trout shot up out of the white water into the falls and was carried down.
Before I could finish baiting, another trout jumped at the falls, making the same lovely arc and disappearing into the water that was thundering down.
I put on a good-sized sinker and dropped into the white water close to the edge of the timbers of the dam.
I did not feel the first trout strike.
When I started to pull up I felt that I had one and brought him, fighting and bending the rod almost double, out of the boiling water at the foot of the falls, and swung him up and onto the dam.
He was a good trout, and I banged his head against the timber so that he quivered out straight, and then slipped him into my bag.
While I had him on, several trout had jumped at the falls.
As soon as I baited up and dropped in again I hooked another and brought him in the same way.
In a little while I had six.
They were all about the same size.
I laid them out, side by side, all their heads pointing the same way, and looked at them.
They were beautifully colored and firm and hard from the cold water.
It was a hot day, so I slit them all and shucked out the insides, gills and all, and tossed them over across the river.
I took the trout ashore, washed them in the cold, smoothly heavy water above the dam, and then picked some ferns and packed them all in the bag, three trout on a layer of ferns, then another layer of fems, then three more trout, and then covered them with ferns.
They looked nice in the ferns, and now the bag was bulky, and I put it in the shade of the tree.
It was very hot on the dam, so I put my worm-can in the shade with the bag, and got a book out of the pack and settled down under the tree to read until Bill should come up for lunch.
It was a little past noon and there was not much shade, but I sat against the trunk of two of the trees that grew together, and read.
The book was something by A.
Mason, and I was reading a wonderful story about a man who had been frozen in the Alps and then fallen into a glacier and disappeared, and his bride was going to wait twenty-four years exactly for his body to come out on the moraine, while her true love waited too, and they were still waiting when Bill came up.
"Get any?" he asked. He had his rod and his bag and his net all in one hand, and he was sweating. I hadn't heard him come up, because of the noise from the dam.
"Six. What did you get?"
Bill sat down, opened up his bag, laid a big trout on the grass.
He took out three more, each one a little bigger than the last, and laid them side by side in the shade from the tree.
His face was sweaty and happy.
"How are yours?"
"Smaller."
"Let's see them."
"They're packed."
"How big are they really?"
"They're all about the size of your smallest."
"You're not holding out on me?"
"I wish I were."
"Get them all on worms?"
"Yes."
"You lazy bum!"
Bill put the trout in the bag and started for the river, swinging the open bag.
He was wet from the waist down and I knew he must have been wading the stream.
I walked up the road and got out the two bottles of wine.
They were cold.
Moisture beaded on the bottles as I walked back to the trees.
I spread the lunch on a newspaper, and uncorked one of the bottles and leaned the other against a tree.
Bill came up drying his hands, his bag plump with ferns.
"Let's see that bottle," he said. He pulled the cork, and tipped up the bottle and drank. "Whew! That makes my eyes ache."
"Let's try it."
The wine was icy cold and tasted faintly rusty.
"That's not such filthy wine," Bill said.
"The cold helps it," I said.
We unwrapped the little parcels of lunch.
"Chicken."
"There's hard-boiled eggs."
"Find any salt?"
"First the egg," said Bill. "Then the chicken. Even Bryan could see that."
"He's dead. I read it in the paper yesterday."
"No. Not really?"
"Yes. Bryan's dead."
Bill laid down the egg he was peeling.
"Gentlemen," he said, and unwrapped a drumstick from a piece of newspaper. "I reverse the order. For Bryan's sake. As a tribute to the Great Commoner. First the chicken; then the egg."
"Wonder what day God created the chicken?"
"Oh," said Bill, sucking the drumstick, "how should we know? We should not question. Our stay on earth is not for long. Let us rejoice and believe and give thanks."
"Eat an egg."
Bill gestured with the drumstick in one hand and the bottle of wine in the other.
"Let us rejoice in our blessings. Let us utilize the fowls of the air. Let us utilize the product of the vine. Will you utilize a little, brother?"
"After you, brother."
Bill took a long drink.
"Utilize a little, brother," he handed me the bottle. "Let us not doubt, brother. Let us not pry into the holy mysteries of the hen-coop with simian fingers. Let us accept on faith and simply say--I want you to join with me in saying--What shall we say, brother?" He pointed the drumstick at me and went on. "Let me tell you. We will say, and I for one am proud to say--and I want you to say with me, on your knees, brother. Let no man be ashamed to kneel here in the great out-of-doors. Remember the woods were God's first temples. Let us kneel and say: 'Don't eat that, Lady--that's Mencken.'"
"Here," I said. "Utilize a little of this."
We uncorked the other bottle.
"What's the matter?" I said. "Didn't you like Bryan?"
"I loved Bryan," said Bill. "We were like brothers."
"Where did you know him?"
"He and Mencken and I all went to Holy Cross together."
"And Frankie Fritsch."
"It's a lie. Frankie Fritsch went to Fordham."
"Well," I said, "I went to Loyola with Bishop Manning."
"It's a lie," Bill said. "I went to Loyola with Bishop Manning myself."
"You're cock-eyed," I said.
"On wine?"
"Why not?"
"It's the humidity," Bill said. "They ought to take this damn humidity away."
"Have another shot."
"Is this all we've got?"
"Only the two bottles."
"Do you know what you are?" Bill looked at the bottle affectionately.
"No," I said.
"You're in the pay of the Anti-Saloon League."
"I went to Notre Dame with Wayne B. Wheeler."
"It's a lie," said Bill. "I went to Austin Business College with Wayne B. Wheeler. He was class president."
"Well," I said, "the saloon must go."
"You're right there, old classmate," Bill said. "The saloon must go, and I will take it with me."
"You're cock-eyed."
"On wine?"
"On wine."
"Well, maybe I am."
"Want to take a nap?"
"All right."
We lay with our heads in the shade and looked up into the trees.
"You asleep?"
"No," Bill said. "I was thinking."
I shut my eyes.
It felt good lying on the ground.
"Say," Bill said, "what about this Brett business?"
"What about it?"
"Were you ever in love with her?"
"Sure."
"For how long?"
"Off and on for a hell of a long time."
"Oh, hell!" Bill said. "I'm sorry, fella."
"It's all right," I said. "I don't give a damn any more."
"Really?"
"Really. Only I'd a hell of a lot rather not talk about it."
"You aren't sore I asked you?"
"Why the hell should I be?"
"I'm going to sleep," Bill said. He put a newspaper over his face.
"Listen, Jake," he said, "are you really a Catholic?"
"Technically."
"What does that mean?"
"I don't know."
"All right, I'll go to sleep now," he said. "Don't keep me awake by talking so much."
I went to sleep, too.
When I woke up Bill was packing the rucksack.
It was late in the afternoon and the shadow from the trees was long and went out over the dam.
I was stiff from sleeping on the ground.
"What did you do? Wake up?" Bill asked. "Why didn't you spend the night?" I stretched and rubbed my eyes.
"I had a lovely dream," Bill said. "I don't remember what it was about, but it was a lovely dream."
"I don't think I dreamt."
"You ought to dream," Bill said. "All our biggest business men have been dreamers. Look at Ford. Look at President Coolidge. Look at Rockefeller. Look at Jo Davidson."
I disjointed my rod and Bill's and packed them in the rod-case.
I put the reels in the tackle-bag.
Bill had packed the rucksack and we put one of the trout-bags in.
I carried the other.
"Well," said Bill, "have we got everything?"
"The worms."
"Your worms. Put them in there."
He had the pack on his back and I put the worm-cans in one of the outside flap pockets.
"You got everything now?"
I looked around on the grass at the foot of the elm-trees.
"Yes."
We started up the road into the woods.
It was a long walk home to Burguete, and it was dark when we came down across the fields to the road, and along the road between the houses of the town, their windows lighted, to the inn.
We stayed five days at Burguete and had good fishing.
The nights were cold and the days were hot, and there was always a breeze even in the heat of the day.
It was hot enough so that it felt good to wade in a cold stream, and the sun dried you when you came out and sat on the bank.
We found a stream with a pool deep enough to swim in.
In the evenings we played three-handed bridge with an Englishman named Harris, who had walked over from Saint Jean Pied de Port and was stopping at the inn for the fishing.
He was very pleasant and went with us twice to the Irati River.
There was no word from Robert Cohn nor from Brett and Mike.
One morning I went down to breakfast and the Englishman, Harris, was already at the table.
He was reading the paper through spectacles.
He looked up and smiled.
"Good morning," he said. "Letter for you. I stopped at the post and they gave it me with mine."
The letter was at my place at the table, leaning against a coffee-cup.
Harris was reading the paper again.
I opened the letter.
It had been forwarded from Pamplona.
It was dated San Sebastian, Sunday:.
DEAR JAKE,.
We got here Friday, Brett passed out on the train, so brought her here for 3 days rest with old friends of ours.
We go to Montoya Hotel Pamplona Tuesday, arriving at I don't know what hour.
Will you send a note by the bus to tell us what to do to rejoin you all on Wednesday.
All our love and sorry to be late, but Brett was really done in and will be quite all right by Tues.
and is practically so now.
I know her so well and try to look after her but it's not so easy.
Love to all the chaps,.
MICHAEL.
"What day of the week is it?" I asked Harris.
"Wednesday, I think. Yes, quite. Wednesday. Wonderful how one loses track of the days up here in the mountains."
"Yes. We've been here nearly a week."
"I hope you're not thinking of leaving?"
"Yes. We'll go in on the afternoon bus, I'm afraid."
"What a rotten business. I had hoped we'd all have another go at the Irati together."
"We have to go into Pamplona. We're meeting people there."
"What rotten luck for me. We've had a jolly time here at Burguete."
"Come on in to Pamplona. We can play some bridge there, and there's going to be a damned fine fiesta."
"I'd like to. Awfully nice of you to ask me. I'd best stop on here, though. I've not much more time to fish."
"You want those big ones in the Irati."
"I say, I do, you know. They're enormous trout there."
"I'd like to try them once more."
"Do. Stop over another day. Be a good chap."
"We really have to get into town," I said.
"What a pity."
After breakfast Bill and I were sitting warming in the sun on a bench out in front of the inn and talking it over.
I saw a girl coming up the road from the centre of the town.
She stopped in front of us and took a telegram out of the leather wallet that hung against her skirt.
"Por ustedes?"
I looked at it.
The address was: "Barnes, Burguete.
"Yes. It's for us."
She brought out a book for me to sign, and I gave her a couple of coppers.
The telegram was in Spanish: "Vengo Jueves Cohn.
I handed it to Bill.
"What does the word Cohn mean?" he asked.
"What a lousy telegram!" I said. "He could send ten words for the same price. 'I come Thursday.' That gives you a lot of dope, doesn't it?"
"It gives you all the dope that's of interest to Cohn."
"We're going in, anyway," I said. "There's no use trying to move Brett and Mike out here and back before the fiesta. Should we answer it?"
"We might as well," said Bill. "There's no need for us to be snooty."
We walked up to the post-office and asked for a telegraph blank.
"What will we say?" Bill asked.
"'Arriving to-night.' That's enough."
We paid for the message and walked back to the inn.
Harris was there and the three of us walked up to Roncesvalles.
We went through the monastery.
"It's a remarkable place," Harris said, when we came out. "But you know I'm not much on those sort of places."
"Me either," Bill said.
"It's a remarkable place, though," Harris said. "I wouldn't not have seen it. I'd been intending coming up each day."
"It isn't the same as fishing, though, is it?" Bill asked. He liked Harris.
"I say not."
We were standing in front of the old chapel of the monastery.
"Isn't that a pub across the way?" Harris asked. "Or do my eyes deceive me?"
"It has the look of a pub," Bill said.
"It looks to me like a pub," I said.
"I say," said Harris, "let's utilize it." He had taken up utilizing from Bill.
We had a bottle of wine apiece.
Harris would not let us pay.
He talked Spanish quite well, and the innkeeper would not take our money.
"I say. You don't know what it's meant to me to have you chaps up here."
"We've had a grand time, Harris."
Harris was a little tight.
"I say. Really you don't know how much it means. I've not had much fun since the war."
"We'll fish together again, some time. Don't you forget it, Harris."
"We must. We have had such a jolly good time."
"How about another bottle around?"
"Jolly good idea," said Harris.
"This is mine," said Bill. "Or we don't drink it."
"I wish you'd let me pay for it. It does give me pleasure, you know."
"This is going to give me pleasure," Bill said.
The innkeeper brought in the fourth bottle.
We had kept the same glasses.
Harris lifted his glass.
"I say. You know this does utilize well."
Bill slapped him on the back.
"Good old Harris."
"I say. You know my name isn't really Harris. It's Wilson-Harris. All one name. With a hyphen, you know."
"Good old Wilson-Harris," Bill said. "We call you Harris because we're so fond of you."
"I say, Barnes. You don't know what this all means to me."
"Come on and utilize another glass," I said.
"Barnes. Really, Barnes, you can't know. That's all."
"Drink up, Harris."
We walked back down the road from Roncesvalles with Harris between us.
We had lunch at the inn and Harris went with us to the bus.
He gave us his card, with his address in London and his club and his business address, and as we got on the bus he handed us each an envelope.
I opened mine and there were a dozen flies in it.
Harris had tied them himself.
He tied all his own flies.
"I say, Harris--" I began.
"No, no!" he said. He was climbing down from the bus. "They're not first-rate flies at all. I only thought if you fished them some time it might remind you of what a good time we had."
The bus started.
Harris stood in front of the post-office.
He waved.
As we started along the road he turned and walked back toward the inn.
"Say, wasn't that Harris nice?" Bill said.
"I think he really did have a good time."
"Harris? You bet he did."
"I wish he'd come into Pamplona."
"He wanted to fish."
"Yes. You couldn't tell how English would mix with each other, anyway."
"I suppose not."
We got into Pamplona late in the afternoon and the bus stopped in front of the Hotel Montoya.
Out in the plaza they were stringing electric-light wires to light the plaza for the fiesta.
A few kids came up when the bus stopped, and a customs officer for the town made all the people getting down from the bus open their bundles on the sidewalk.
We went into the hotel and on the stairs I met Montoya.
He shook hands with us, smiling in his embarrassed way.
"Your friends are here," he said.
"Mr. Campbell?"
"Yes. Mr. Cohn and Mr. Campbell and Lady Ashley."
He smiled as though there were something I would hear about.
"When did they get in?"
"Yesterday. I've saved you the rooms you had."
"That's fine. Did you give Mr. Campbell the room on the plaza?"
"Yes. All the rooms we looked at."
"Where are our friends now?"
"I think they went to the pelota."
"And how about the bulls?"
Montoya smiled.
"To-night," he said.
"To-night at seven o'clock they bring in the Villar bulls, and to-morrow come the Miuras.
Do you all go down?".
"Oh, yes. They've never seen a desencajonada."
Montoya put his hand on my shoulder.
"I'll see you there."
He smiled again.
He always smiled as though bull-fighting were a very special secret between the two of us; a rather shocking but really very deep secret that we knew about.
He always smiled as though there were something lewd about the secret to outsiders, but that it was something that we understood.
It would not do to expose it to people who would not understand.
"Your friend, is he aficionado, too?" Montoya smiled at Bill.
"Yes. He came all the way from New York to see the San Fermines."
"Yes?" Montoya politely disbelieved. "But he's not aficionado like you."
He put his hand on my shoulder again embarrassedly.
"Yes," I said. "He's a real aficionado."
"But he's not aficionado like you are."
Aficion means passion.
An aficionado is one who is passionate about the bull-fights.
All the good bull-fighters stayed at Montoya's hotel; that is, those with aficion stayed there.
The commercial bull-fighters stayed once, perhaps, and then did not come back.
The good ones came each year.
In Montoya's room were their photographs.
The photographs were dedicated to Juanito Montoya or to his sister.
The photographs of bull-fighters Montoya had really believed in were framed.
Photographs of bull-fighters who had been without aficion Montoya kept in a drawer of his desk.
They often had the most flattering inscriptions.
But they did not mean anything.
One day Montoya took them all out and dropped them in the waste-basket.
He did not want them around.
We often talked about bulls and bull-fighters.
I had stopped at the Montoya for several years.
We never talked for very long at a time.
It was simply the pleasure of discovering what we each felt.
Men would come in from distant towns and before they left Pamplona stop and talk for a few minutes with Montoya about bulls.
These men were aficionados.
Those who were aficionados could always get rooms even when the hotel was full.
Montoya introduced me to some of them.
They were always very polite at first, and it amused them very much that I should be an American.
Somehow it was taken for granted that an American could not have aficion.
He might simulate it or confuse it with excitement, but he could not really have it.
When they saw that I had aficion, and there was no password, no set questions that could bring it out, rather it was a sort of oral spiritual examination with the questions always a little on the defensive and never apparent, there was this same embarrassed putting the hand on the shoulder, or a "Buen hombre.
" But nearly always there was the actual touching.
It seemed as though they wanted to touch you to make it certain.
Montoya could forgive anything of a bull-fighter who had aficion.
He could forgive attacks of nerves, panic, bad unexplainable actions, all sorts of lapses.
For one who had aficion he could forgive anything.
At once he forgave me all my friends.
Without his ever saying anything they were simply a little something shameful between us, like the spilling open of the horses in bull-fighting.
Bill had gone up-stairs as we came in, and I found him washing and changing in his room.
"Well," he said, "talk a lot of Spanish?"
"He was telling me about the bulls coming in to-night."
"Let's find the gang and go down."
"All right. They'll probably be at the café."
"Have you got tickets?"
"Yes. I got them for all the unloadings."
"What's it like?" He was pulling his cheek before the glass, looking to see if there were unshaved patches under the line of the jaw.
"It's pretty good," I said. "They let the bulls out of the cages one at a time, and they have steers in the corral to receive them and keep them from fighting, and the bulls tear in at the steers and the steers run around like old maids trying to quiet them down."
"Do they ever gore the steers?"
"Sure. Sometimes they go right after them and kill them."
"Can't the steers do anything?"
"No. They're trying to make friends."
"What do they have them in for?"
"To quiet down the bulls and keep them from breaking horns against the stone walls, or goring each other."
"Must be swell being a steer."
We went down the stairs and out of the door and walked across the square toward the Café Iruña.
There were two lonely looking ticket-houses standing in the square.
Their windows, marked SOL, SOL Y SOMBRA, and SOMBRA, were shut.
They would not open until the day before the fiesta.
Across the square the white wicker tables and chairs of the Iruña extended out beyond the Arcade to the edge of the street.
I looked for Brett and Mike at the tables.
There they were.
Brett and Mike and Robert Cohn.
Brett was wearing a Basque beret.
So was Mike.
Robert Cohn was bare-headed and wearing his spectacles.
Brett saw us coming and waved.
Her eyes crinkled up as we came up to the table.
"Hello, you chaps!" she called.
Brett was happy.
Mike had a way of getting an intensity of feeling into shaking hands.
Robert Cohn shook hands because we were back.
"Where the hell have you been?" I asked.
"I brought them up here," Cohn said.
"What rot," Brett said. "We'd have gotten here earlier if you hadn't come."
"You'd never have gotten here."
"What rot! You chaps are brown. Look at Bill."
"Did you get good fishing?" Mike asked. "We wanted to join you."
"It wasn't bad. We missed you."
"I wanted to come," Cohn said, "but I thought I ought to bring them."
"You bring us. What rot."
"Was it really good?" Mike asked. "Did you take many?"
"Some days we took a dozen apiece. There was an Englishman up there."
"Named Harris," Bill said. "Ever know him, Mike? He was in the war, too."
"Fortunate fellow," Mike said. "What times we had. How I wish those dear days were back."
"Don't be an ass."
"Were you in the war, Mike?" Cohn asked.
"Was I not."
"He was a very distinguished soldier," Brett said. "Tell them about the time your horse bolted down Piccadilly."
"I'll not. I've told that four times."
"You never told me," Robert Cohn said.
"I'll not tell that story. It reflects discredit on me."
"Tell them about your medals."
"I'll not. That story reflects great discredit on me."
"What story's that?"
"Brett will tell you. She tells all the stories that reflect discredit on me."
"Go on. Tell it, Brett."
"Should I?"
"I'll tell it myself."
"What medals have you got, Mike?"
"I haven't got any medals."
"You must have some."
"I suppose I've the usual medals. But I never sent in for them. One time there was this wopping big dinner and the Prince of Wales was to be there, and the cards said medals will be worn. So naturally I had no medals, and I stopped at my tailor's and he was impressed by the invitation, and I thought that's a good piece of business, and I said to him: 'You've got to fix me up with some medals.' He said: 'What medals, sir?' And I said: 'Oh, any medals. Just give me a few medals.' So he said: 'What medals have you, sir?' And I said: 'How should I know?' Did he think I spent all my time reading the bloody gazette? 'Just give me a good lot. Pick them out yourself.' So he got me some medals, you know, miniature medals, and handed me the box, and I put it in my pocket and forgot it. Well, I went to the dinner, and it was the night they'd shot Henry Wilson, so the Prince didn't come and the King didn't come, and no one wore any medals, and all these coves were busy taking off their medals, and I had mine in my pocket."
He stopped for us to laugh.
"Is that all?"
"That's all. Perhaps I didn't tell it right."
"You didn't," said Brett. "But no matter."
We were all laughing.
"Ah, yes," said Mike. "I know now. It was a damn dull dinner, and I couldn't stick it, so I left. Later on in the evening I found the box in my pocket. What's this? I said. Medals? Bloody military medals? So I cut them all off their backing--you know, they put them on a strip--and gave them all around. Gave one to each girl. Form of souvenir. They thought I was hell's own shakes of a soldier. Give away medals in a night club. Dashing fellow."
"Tell the rest," Brett said.
"Don't you think that was funny?" Mike asked. We were all laughing. "It was. I swear it was. Any rate, my tailor wrote me and wanted the medals back. Sent a man around. Kept on writing for months. Seems some chap had left them to be cleaned. Frightfully military cove. Set hell's own store by them." Mike paused. "Rotten luck for the tailor," he said.
"You don't mean it," Bill said. "I should think it would have been grand for the tailor."
"Frightfully good tailor. Never believe it to see me now," Mike said. "I used to pay him a hundred pounds a year just to keep him quiet. So he wouldn't send me any bills. Frightful blow to him when I went bankrupt. It was right after the medals. Gave his letters rather a bitter tone."
"How did you go bankrupt?" Bill asked.
"Two ways," Mike said. "Gradually and then suddenly."
"What brought it on?"
"Friends," said Mike. "I had a lot of friends. False friends. Then I had creditors, too. Probably had more creditors than anybody in England."
"Tell them about in the court," Brett said.
"I don't remember," Mike said. "I was just a little tight."
"Tight!" Brett exclaimed. "You were blind!"
"Extraordinary thing," Mike said. "Met my former partner the other day. Offered to buy me a drink."
"Tell them about your learned counsel," Brett said.
"I will not," Mike said. "My learned counsel was blind, too. I say this is a gloomy subject. Are we going down and see these bulls unloaded or not?"
"Let's go down."
We called the waiter, paid, and started to walk through the town.
I started off walking with Brett, but Robert Cohn came up and joined her on the other side.
The three of us walked along, past the Ayuntamiento with the banners hung from the balcony, down past the market and down past the steep street that led to the bridge across the Arga.
There were many people walking to go and see the bulls, and carriages drove down the hill and across the bridge, the drivers, the horses, and the whips rising above the walking people in the street.
Across the bridge we turned up a road to the corrals.
We passed a wine-shop with a sign in the window: Good Wine 30 Centimes A Liter.
"That's where we'll go when funds get low," Brett said.
The woman standing in the door of the wine-shop looked at us as we passed.
She called to some one in the house and three girls came to the window and stared.
They were staring at Brett.
At the gate of the corrals two men took tickets from the people that went in.
We went in through the gate.
There were trees inside and a low, stone house.
At the far end was the stone wall of the corrals, with apertures in the stone that were like loopholes running all along the face of each corral.
A ladder led up to the top of the wall, and people were climbing up the ladder and spreading down to stand on the walls that separated the two corrals.
As we came up the ladder, walking across the grass under the trees, we passed the big, gray painted cages with the bulls in them.
There was one bull in each travelling-box.
They had come by train from a bull-breeding ranch in Castile, and had been unloaded off flat-cars at the station and brought up here to be let out of their cages into the corrals.
Each cage was stencilled with the name and the brand of the bull-breeder.
We climbed up and found a place on the wall looking down into the corral.
The stone walls were whitewashed, and there was straw on the ground and wooden feed-boxes and water-troughs set against the wall.
"Look up there," I said.
Beyond the river rose the plateau of the town.
All along the old walls and ramparts people were standing.
The three lines of fortifications made three black lines of people.
Above the walls there were heads in the windows of the houses.
At the far end of the plateau boys had climbed into the trees.
"They must think something is going to happen," Brett said.
"They want to see the bulls."
Mike and Bill were on the other wall across the pit of the corral.
They waved to us.
People who had come late were standing behind us, pressing against us when other people crowded them.
"Why don't they start?" Robert Cohn asked.
A single mule was hitched to one of the cages and dragged it up against the gate in the corral wall.
The men shoved and lifted it with crowbars into position against the gate.
Men were standing on the wall ready to pull up the gate of the corral and then the gate of the cage.
At the other end of the corral a gate opened and two steers came in, swaying their heads and trotting, their lean flanks swinging.
They stood together at the far end, their heads toward the gate where the bull would enter.
"They don't look happy," Brett said.
The men on top of the wall leaned back and pulled up the door of the corral.
Then they pulled up the door of the cage.
I leaned way over the wall and tried to see into the cage.
It was dark.
Some one rapped on the cage with an iron bar.
Inside something seemed to explode.
The bull, striking into the wood from side to side with his horns, made a great noise.
Then I saw a dark muzzle and the shadow of horns, and then, with a clattering on the wood in the hollow box, the bull charged and came out into the corral, skidding with his forefeet in the straw as he stopped, his head up, the great hump of muscle on his neck swollen tight, his body muscles quivering as he looked up at the crowd on the stone walls.
The two steers backed away against the wall, their heads sunken, their eyes watching the bull.
The bull saw them and charged.
A man shouted from behind one of the boxes and slapped his hat against the planks, and the bull, before he reached the steer, turned, gathered himself and charged where the man had been, trying to reach him behind the planks with a half-dozen quick, searching drives with the right horn.
"My God, isn't he beautiful?" Brett said. We were looking right down on him.
"Look how he knows how to use his horns," I said. "He's got a left and a right just like a boxer."
"Not really?"
"You watch."
"It goes too fast."
"Wait. There'll be another one in a minute."
They had backed up another cage into the entrance.
In the far corner a man, from behind one of the plank shelters, attracted the bull, and while the bull was facing away the gate was pulled up and a second bull came out into the corral.
He charged straight for the steers and two men ran out from behind the planks and shouted, to turn him.
He did not change his direction and the men shouted: "Hah! Hah! Toro!" and waved their arms; the two steers turned sideways to take the shock, and the bull drove into one of the steers.
"Don't look," I said to Brett. She was watching, fascinated.
"Fine," I said. "If it doesn't buck you."
"I saw it," she said. "I saw him shift from his left to his right horn."
"Damn good!"
The steer was down now, his neck stretched out, his head twisted, he lay the way he had fallen.
Suddenly the bull left off and made for the other steer which had been standing at the far end, his head swinging, watching it all.
The steer ran awkwardly and the bull caught him, hooked him lightly in the flank, and then turned away and looked up at the crowd on the walls, his crest of muscle rising.
The steer came up to him and made as though to nose at him and the bull hooked perfunctorily.
The next time he nosed at the steer and then the two of them trotted over to the other bull.
When the next bull came out, all three, the two bulls and the steer, stood together, their heads side by side, their horns against the newcomer.
In a few minutes the steer picked the new bull up, quieted him down, and made him one of the herd.
When the last two bulls had been unloaded the herd were all together.
The steer who had been gored had gotten to his feet and stood against the stone wall.
None of the bulls came near him, and he did not attempt to join the herd.
We climbed down from the wall with the crowd, and had a last look at the bulls through the loopholes in the wall of the corral.
They were all quiet now, their heads down.
We got a carriage outside and rode up to the café.
Mike and Bill came in half an hour later.
They had stopped on the way for several drinks.
We were sitting in the café.
"That's an extraordinary business," Brett said.
"Will those last ones fight as well as the first?" Robert Cohn asked. "They seemed to quiet down awfully fast."
"They all know each other," I said. "They're only dangerous when they're alone, or only two or three of them together."
"What do you mean, dangerous?" Bill said. "They all looked dangerous to me."
"They only want to kill when they're alone. Of course, if you went in there you'd probably detach one of them from the herd, and he'd be dangerous."
"That's too complicated," Bill said. "Don't you ever detach me from the herd, Mike."
"I say," Mike said, "they were fine bulls, weren't they? Did you see their horns?"
"Did I not," said Brett. "I had no idea what they were like."
"Did you see the one hit that steer?" Mike asked. "That was extraordinary."
"It's no life being a steer," Robert Cohn said.
"Don't you think so?" Mike said. "I would have thought you'd loved being a steer, Robert."
"What do you mean, Mike?"
"They lead such a quiet life. They never say anything and they're always hanging about so."
We were embarrassed.
Bill laughed.
Robert Cohn was angry.
Mike went on talking.
"I should think you'd love it. You'd never have to say a word. Come on, Robert. Do say something. Don't just sit there."
"I said something, Mike. Don't you remember? About the steers."
"Oh, say something more. Say something funny. Can't you see we're all having a good time here?"
"Come off it, Michael. You're drunk," Brett said.
"I'm not drunk. I'm quite serious. Is Robert Cohn going to follow Brett around like a steer all the time?"
"Shut up, Michael. Try and show a little breeding."
"Breeding be damned. Who has any breeding, anyway, except the bulls? Aren't the bulls lovely? Don't you like them, Bill? Why don't you say something, Robert? Don't sit there looking like a bloody funeral. What if Brett did sleep with you? She's slept with lots of better people than you."
"Shut up," Cohn said. He stood up. "Shut up, Mike."
"Oh, don't stand up and act as though you were going to hit me. That won't make any difference to me. Tell me, Robert. Why do you follow Brett around like a poor bloody steer? Don't you know you're not wanted? I know when I'm not wanted. Why don't you know when you're not wanted? You came down to San Sebastian where you weren't wanted, and followed Brett around like a bloody steer. Do you think that's right?"
"Shut up. You're drunk."
"Perhaps I am drunk. Why aren't you drunk? Why don't you ever get drunk, Robert? You know you didn't have a good time at San Sebastian because none of our friends would invite you on any of the parties. You can't blame them hardly. Can you? I asked them to. They wouldn't do it. You can't blame them, now. Can you? Now, answer me. Can you blame them?"
"Go to hell, Mike."
"I can't blame them. Can you blame them? Why do you follow Brett around? Haven't you any manners? How do you think it makes me feel?"
"You're a splendid one to talk about manners," Brett said. "You've such lovely manners."
"Come on, Robert," Bill said.
"What do you follow her around for?"
Bill stood up and took hold of Cohn.
"Don't go," Mike said. "Robert Cohn's going to buy a drink."
Bill went off with Cohn.
Cohn's face was sallow.
Mike went on talking.
I sat and listened for a while.
Brett looked disgusted.
"I say, Michael, you might not be such a bloody ass," she interrupted. "I'm not saying he's not right, you know." She turned to me.
The emotion left Mike's voice.
We were all friends together.
"I'm not so damn drunk as I sounded," he said.
"I know you're not," Brett said.
"We're none of us sober," I said.
"I didn't say anything I didn't mean."
"But you put it so badly," Brett laughed.
"He was an ass, though. He came down to San Sebastian where he damn well wasn't wanted. He hung around Brett and just looked at her. It made me damned well sick."
"He did behave very badly," Brett said.
"Mark you. Brett's had affairs with men before. She tells me all about everything. She gave me this chap Cohn's letters to read. I wouldn't read them."
"Damned noble of you."
"No, listen, Jake. Brett's gone off with men. But they weren't ever Jews, and they didn't come and hang about afterward."
"Damned good chaps," Brett said. "It's all rot to talk about it. Michael and I understand each other."
"She gave me Robert Cohn's letters. I wouldn't read them."
"You wouldn't read any letters, darling. You wouldn't read mine."
"I can't read letters," Mike said. "Funny, isn't it?"
"You can't read anything."
"No. You're wrong there. I read quite a bit. I read when I'm at home."
"You'll be writing next," Brett said. "Come on, Michael. Do buck up. You've got to go through with this thing now. He's here. Don't spoil the fiesta."
"Well, let him behave, then."
"He'll behave. I'll tell him."
"You tell him, Jake. Tell him either he must behave or get out."
"Yes," I said, "it would be nice for me to tell him."
"Look, Brett. Tell Jake what Robert calls you. That is perfect, you know."
"Oh, no. I can't."
"Go on. We're all friends. Aren't we all friends, Jake?"
"I can't tell him. It's too ridiculous."
"I'll tell him."
"You won't, Michael. Don't be an ass."
"He calls her Circe," Mike said. "He claims she turns men into swine. Damn good. I wish I were one of these literary chaps."
"He'd be good, you know," Brett said. "He writes a good letter."
"I know," I said. "He wrote me from San Sebastian."
"That was nothing," Brett said. "He can write a damned amusing letter."
"She made me write that. She was supposed to be ill."
"I damned well was, too."
"Come on," I said, "we must go in and eat."
"How should I meet Cohn?" Mike said.
"Just act as though nothing had happened."
"It's quite all right with me," Mike said. "I'm not embarrassed."
"If he says anything, just say you were tight."
"Quite. And the funny thing is I think I was tight."
"Come on," Brett said. "Are these poisonous things paid for? I must bathe before dinner."
We walked across the square.
It was dark and all around the square were the lights from the cafés under the arcades.
We walked across the gravel under the trees to the hotel.
They went up-stairs and I stopped to speak with Montoya.
"Well, how did you like the bulls?" he asked.
"Good. They were nice bulls."
"They're all right"--Montoya shook his head--"but they're not too good."
"What didn't you like about them?"
"I don't know. They just didn't give me the feeling that they were so good."
"I know what you mean."
"They're all right."
"Yes. They're all right."
"How did your friends like them?"
"Fine."
"Good," Montoya said.
I went up-stairs.
Bill was in his room standing on the balcony looking out at the square.
I stood beside him.
"Where's Cohn?"
"Up-stairs in his room."
"How does he feel?"
"Like hell, naturally. Mike was awful. He's terrible when he's tight."
"He wasn't so tight."
"The hell he wasn't. I know what we had before we came to the café."
"He sobered up afterward."
"Good. He was terrible. I don't like Cohn, God knows, and I think it was a silly trick for him to go down to San Sebastian, but nobody has any business to talk like Mike."
"How'd you like the bulls?"
"Grand. It's grand the way they bring them out."
"To-morrow come the Miuras."
"When does the fiesta start?"
"Day after to-morrow."
"We've got to keep Mike from getting so tight. That kind of stuff is terrible."
"We'd better get cleaned up for supper."
"Yes. That will be a pleasant meal."
"Won't it?"
As a matter of fact, supper was a pleasant meal.
Brett wore a black, sleeveless evening dress.
She looked quite beautiful.
Mike acted as though nothing had happened.
I had to go up and bring Robert Cohn down.
He was reserved and formal, and his face was still taut and sallow, but he cheered up finally.
He could not stop looking at Brett.
It seemed to make him happy.
It must have been pleasant for him to see her looking so lovely, and know he had been away with her and that every one knew it.
They could not take that away from him.
Bill was very funny.
So was Michael.
They were good together.
It was like certain dinners I remember from the war.
There was much wine, an ignored tension, and a feeling of things coming that you could not prevent happening.
Under the wine I lost the disgusted feeling and was happy.
It seemed they were all such nice people.
I do not know what time I got to bed.
I remember undressing, putting on a bathrobe, and standing out on the balcony.
I knew I was quite drunk, and when I came in I put on the light over the head of the bed and started to read.
I was reading a book by Turgenieff.
Probably I read the same two pages over several times.
It was one of the stories in "A Sportsman's Sketches.
" I had read it before, but it seemed quite new.
The country became very clear and the feeling of pressure in my head seemed to loosen.
I was very drunk and I did not want to shut my eyes because the room would go round and round.
If I kept on reading that feeling would pass.
I heard Brett and Robert Cohn come up the stairs.
Cohn said good night outside the door and went on up to his room.
I heard Brett go into the room next door.
Mike was already in bed.
He had come in with me an hour before.
He woke as she came in, and they talked together.
I heard them laugh.
I turned off the light and tried to go to sleep.
It was not necessary to read any more.
I could shut my eyes without getting the wheeling sensation.
But I could not sleep.
There is no reason why because it is dark you should look at things differently from when it is light.
The hell there isn't!.
I figured that all out once, and for six months I never slept with the electric light off.
That was another bright idea.
To hell with women, anyway.
To hell with you, Brett Ashley.
Women made such swell friends.
Awfully swell.
In the first place, you had to be in love with a woman to have a basis of friendship.
I had been having Brett for a friend.
I had not been thinking about her side of it.
I had been getting something for nothing.
That only delayed the presentation of the bill.
The bill always came.
That was one of the swell things you could count on.
I thought I had paid for everything.
Not like the woman pays and pays and pays.
No idea of retribution or punishment.
Just exchange of values.
You gave up something and got something else.
Or you worked for something.
You paid some way for everything that was any good.
I paid my way into enough things that I liked, so that I had a good time.
Either you paid by learning about them, or by experience, or by taking chances, or by money.
Enjoying living was learning to get your money's worth and knowing when you had it.
You could get your money's worth.
The world was a good place to buy in.
It seemed like a fine philosophy.
In five years, I thought, it will seem just as silly as all the other fine philosophies I've had.
Perhaps that wasn't true, though.
Perhaps as you went along you did learn something.
I did not care what it was all about.
All I wanted to know was how to live in it.
Maybe if you found out how to live in it you learned from that what it was all about.
I wished Mike would not behave so terribly to Cohn, though.
Mike was a bad drunk.
Brett was a good drunk.
Bill was a good drunk.
Cohn was never drunk.
Mike was unpleasant after he passed a certain point.
I liked to see him hurt Cohn.
I wished he would not do it, though, because afterward it made me disgusted at myself.
That was morality; things that made you disgusted afterward.
No, that must be immorality.
That was a large statement.
What a lot of bilge I could think up at night.
What rot, I could hear Brett say it.
What rot! When you were with English you got into the habit of using English expressions in your thinking.
The English spoken language--the upper classes, anyway--must have fewer words than the Eskimo.
Of course I didn't know anything about the Eskimo.
Maybe the Eskimo was a fine language.
Say the Cherokee.
I didn't know anything about the Cherokee, either.
The English talked with inflected phrases.
One phrase to mean everything.
I liked them, though.
I liked the way they talked.
Take Harris.
Still Harris was not the upper classes.
I turned on the light again and read.
I read the Turgenieff.
I knew that now, reading it in the oversensitized state of my mind after much too much brandy, I would remember it somewhere, and afterward it would seem as though it had really happened to me.
I would always have it.
That was another good thing you paid for and then had.
Some time along toward daylight I went to sleep.
* * * * *.
The next two days in Pamplona were quiet, and there were no more rows.
The town was getting ready for the fiesta.
Workmen put up the gate-posts that were to shut off the side streets when the bulls were released from the corrals and came running through the streets in the morning on their way to the ring.
The workmen dug holes and fitted in the timbers, each timber numbered for its regular place.
Out on the plateau beyond the town employees of the bull-ring exercised picador horses, galloping them stiff-legged on the hard, sun-baked fields behind the bull-ring.
The big gate of the bull-ring was open, and inside the amphitheatre was being swept.
The ring was rolled and sprinkled, and carpenters replaced weakened or cracked planks in the barrera.
Standing at the edge of the smooth rolled sand you could look up in the empty stands and see old women sweeping out the boxes.
Outside, the fence that led from the last street of the town to the entrance of the bull-ring was already in place and made a long pen; the crowd would come running down with the bulls behind them on the morning of the day of the first bull-fight.
Out across the plain, where the horse and cattle fair would be, some gypsies had camped under the trees.
The wine and aguardiente sellers were putting up their booths.
One booth advertised ANIS DEL TORO.
The cloth sign hung against the planks in the hot sun.
In the big square that was the centre of the town there was no change yet.
We sat in the white wicker chairs on the terrasse of the café and watched the motor-buses come in and unload peasants from the country coming in to the market, and we watched the buses fill up and start out with peasants sitting with their saddle-bags full of the things they had bought in the town.
The tall gray motor-buses were the only life of the square except for the pigeons and the man with a hose who sprinkled the gravelled square and watered the streets.
In the evening was the paseo.
For an hour after dinner every one, all the good-looking girls, the officers from the garrison, all the fashionable people of the town, walked in the street on one side of the square while the café tables filled with the regular after-dinner crowd.
During the morning I usually sat in the café and read the Madrid papers and then walked in the town or out into the country.
Sometimes Bill went along.
Sometimes he wrote in his room.
Robert Cohn spent the mornings studying Spanish or trying to get a shave at the barber-shop.
Brett and Mike never got up until noon.
We all had a vermouth at the café.
It was a quiet life and no one was drunk.
I went to church a couple of times, once with Brett.
She said she wanted to hear me go to confession, but I told her that not only was it impossible but it was not as interesting as it sounded, and, besides, it would be in a language she did not know.
We met Cohn as we came out of church, and although it was obvious he had followed us, yet he was very pleasant and nice, and we all three went for a walk out to the gypsy camp, and Brett had her fortune told.
It was a good morning, there were high white clouds above the mountains.
It had rained a little in the night and it was fresh and cool on the plateau, and there was a wonderful view.
We all felt good and we felt healthy, and I felt quite friendly to Cohn.
You could not be upset about anything on a day like that.
That was the last day before the fiesta.
At noon of Sunday, the 6th of July, the fiesta exploded.
There is no other way to describe it.
People had been coming in all day from the country, but they were assimilated in the town and you did not notice them.
The square was as quiet in the hot sun as on any other day.
The peasants were in the outlying wine-shops.
There they were drinking, getting ready for the fiesta.
They had come in so recently from the plains and the hills that it was necessary that they make their shifting in values gradually.
They could not start in paying café prices.
They got their money's worth in the wine-shops.
Money still had a definite value in hours worked and bushels of grain sold.
Late in the fiesta it would not matter what they paid, nor where they bought.
Now on the day of the starting of the fiesta of San Fermin they had been in the wine-shops of the narrow streets of the town since early morning.
Going down the streets in the morning on the way to mass in the cathedral, I heard them singing through the open doors of the shops.
They were warming up.
There were many people at the eleven o'clock mass.
San Fermin is also a religious festival.
I walked down the hill from the cathedral and up the street to the café on the square.
It was a little before noon.
Robert Cohn and Bill were sitting at one of the tables.
The marble-topped tables and the white wicker chairs were gone.
They were replaced by cast-iron tables and severe folding chairs.
The café was like a battleship stripped for action.
To-day the waiters did not leave you alone all morning to read without asking if you wanted to order something.
A waiter came up as soon as I sat down.
"What are you drinking?" I asked Bill and Robert.
"Sherry," Cohn said.
"Jerez," I said to the waiter.
Before the waiter brought the sherry the rocket that announced the fiesta went up in the square.
It burst and there was a gray ball of smoke high up above the Theatre Gayarre, across on the other side of the plaza.
The ball of smoke hung in the sky like a shrapnel burst, and as I watched, another rocket came up to it, trickling smoke in the bright sunlight.
I saw the bright flash as it burst and another little cloud of smoke appeared.
By the time the second rocket had burst there were so many people in the arcade, that had been empty a minute before, that the waiter, holding the bottle high up over his head, could hardly get through the crowd to our table.
People were coming into the square from all sides, and down the street we heard the pipes and the fifes and the drums coming.
They were playing the riau-riau music, the pipes shrill and the drums pounding, and behind them came the men and boys dancing.
When the fifers stopped they all crouched down in the street, and when the reed-pipes and the fifes shrilled, and the flat, dry, hollow drums tapped it out again, they all went up in the air dancing.
In the crowd you saw only the heads and shoulders of the dancers going up and down.
In the square a man, bent over, was playing on a reed-pipe, and a crowd of children were following him shouting, and pulling at his clothes.
He came out of the square, the children following him, and piped them past the café and down a side street.
We saw his blank pockmarked face as he went by, piping, the children close behind him shouting and pulling at him.
"He must be the village idiot," Bill said. "My God! look at that!"
Down the street came dancers.
The street was solid with dancers, all men.
They were all dancing in time behind their own fifers and drummers.
They were a club of some sort, and all wore workmen's blue smocks, and red handkerchiefs around their necks, and carried a great banner on two poles.
The banner danced up and down with them as they came down surrounded by the crowd.
"Hurray for Wine! Hurray for the Foreigners!" was painted on the banner.
"Where are the foreigners?" Robert Cohn asked.
"We're the foreigners," Bill said.
All the time rockets were going up.
The café tables were all full now.
The square was emptying of people and the crowd was filling the cafés.
"Where's Brett and Mike?" Bill asked.
"I'll go and get them," Cohn said.
"Bring them here."
The fiesta was really started.
It kept up day and night for seven days.
The dancing kept up, the drinking kept up, the noise went on.
The things that happened could only have happened during a fiesta.
Everything became quite unreal finally and it seemed as though nothing could have any consequences.
It seemed out of place to think of consequences during the fiesta.
All during the fiesta you had the feeling, even when it was quiet, that you had to shout any remark to make it heard.
It was the same feeling about any action.
It was a fiesta and it went on for seven days.
That afternoon was the big religious procession.
San Fermin was translated from one church to another.
In the procession were all the dignitaries, civil and religious.
We could not see them because the crowd was too great.
Ahead of the formal procession and behind it danced the riau-riau dancers.
There was one mass of yellow shirts dancing up and down in the crowd.
All we could see of the procession through the closely pressed people that crowded all the side streets and curbs were the great giants, cigar-store Indians, thirty feet high, Moors, a King and Queen, whirling and waltzing solemnly to the riau-riau.
They were all standing outside the chapel where San Fermin and the dignitaries had passed in, leaving a guard of soldiers, the giants, with the men who danced in them standing beside their resting frames, and the dwarfs moving with their whacking bladders through the crowd.
We started inside and there was a smell of incense and people filing back into the church, but Brett was stopped just inside the door because she had no hat, so we went out again and along the street that ran back from the chapel into town.
The street was lined on both sides with people keeping their place at the curb for the return of the procession.
Some dancers formed a circle around Brett and started to dance.
They wore big wreaths of white garlics around their necks.
They took Bill and me by the arms and put us in the circle.
Bill started to dance, too.
They were all chanting.
Brett wanted to dance but they did not want her to.
They wanted her as an image to dance around.
When the song ended with the sharp riau-riau! they rushed us into a wine-shop.
We stood at the counter.
They had Brett seated on a wine-cask.
It was dark in the wine-shop and full of men singing, hard-voiced singing.
Back of the counter they drew the wine from casks.
I put down money for the wine, but one of the men picked it up and put it back in my pocket.
"I want a leather wine-bottle," Bill said.
"There's a place down the street," I said. "I'll go get a couple."
The dancers did not want me to go out.
Three of them were sitting on the high wine-cask beside Brett, teaching her to drink out of the wine-skins.
They had hung a wreath of garlics around her neck.
Some one insisted on giving her a glass.
Somebody was teaching Bill a song.
Singing it into his ear.
Beating time on Bill's back.
I explained to them that I would be back.
Outside in the street I went down the street looking for the shop that made leather wine-bottles.
The crowd was packed on the sidewalks and many of the shops were shuttered, and I could not find it.
I walked as far as the church, looking on both sides of the street.
Then I asked a man and he took me by the arm and led me to it.
The shutters were up but the door was open.
Inside it smelled of fresh tanned leather and hot tar.
A man was stencilling completed wine-skins.
They hung from the roof in bunches.
He took one down, blew it up, screwed the nozzle tight, and then jumped on it.
"See! It doesn't leak."
"I want another one, too. A big one."
He took down a big one that would hold a gallon or more, from the roof.
He blew it up, his cheeks puffing ahead of the wine-skin, and stood on the bota holding on to a chair.
"What are you going to do? Sell them in Bayonne?"
"No. Drink out of them."
He slapped me on the back.
"Good man. Eight pesetas for the two. The lowest price."
The man who was stencilling the new ones and tossing them into a pile stopped.
"It's true," he said. "Eight pesetas is cheap."
I paid and went out and along the street back to the wine-shop.
It was darker than ever inside and very crowded.
I did not see Brett and Bill, and some one said they were in the back room.
At the counter the girl filled the two wine-skins for me.
One held two litres.
The other held five litres.
Filling them both cost three pesetas sixty centimos.
Some one at the counter, that I had never seen before, tried to pay for the wine, but I finally paid for it myself.
The man who had wanted to pay then bought me a drink.
He would not let me buy one in return, but said he would take a rinse of the mouth from the new wine-bag.
He tipped the big five-litre bag up and squeezed it so the wine hissed against the back of his throat.
"All right," he said, and handed back the bag.
In the back room Brett and Bill were sitting on barrels surrounded by the dancers.
Everybody had his arms on everybody else's shoulders, and they were all singing.
Mike was sitting at a table with several men in their shirt-sleeves, eating from a bowl of tuna fish, chopped onions and vinegar.
They were all drinking wine and mopping up the oil and vinegar with pieces of bread.
"Hello, Jake. Hello!" Mike called. "Come here. I want you to meet my friends. We're all having an hors-d'oeuvre."
I was introduced to the people at the table.
They supplied their names to Mike and sent for a fork for me.
"Stop eating their dinner, Michael," Brett shouted from the wine-barrels.
"I don't want to eat up your meal," I said when some one handed me a fork.
"Eat," he said. "What do you think it's here for?"
I unscrewed the nozzle of the big wine-bottle and handed it around.
Every one took a drink, tipping the wine-skin at arm's length.
Outside, above the singing, we could hear the music of the procession going by.
"Isn't that the procession?" Mike asked.
"Nada," some one said. "It's nothing. Drink up. Lift the bottle."
"Where did they find you?" I asked Mike.
"Some one brought me here," Mike said. "They said you were here."
"Where's Cohn?"
"He's passed out," Brett called. "They've put him away somewhere."
"Where is he?"
"I don't know."
"How should we know," Bill said. "I think he's dead."
"He's not dead," Mike said. "I know he's not dead. He's just passed out on Anis del Mono."
As he said Anis del Mono one of the men at the table looked up, brought out a bottle from inside his smock, and handed it to me.
"No," I said. "No, thanks!"
"Yes. Yes. Arriba! Up with the bottle!"
I took a drink.
It tasted of licorice and warmed all the way.
I could feel it warming in my stomach.
"Where the hell is Cohn?"
"I don't know," Mike said. "I'll ask. Where is the drunken comrade?" he asked in Spanish.
"You want to see him?"
"Yes," I said.
"Not me," said Mike. "This gent."
The Anis del Mono man wiped his mouth and stood up.
"Come on."
In a back room Robert Cohn was sleeping quietly on some wine-casks.
It was almost too dark to see his face.
They had covered him with a coat and another coat was folded under his head.
Around his neck and on his chest was a big wreath of twisted garlics.
"Let him sleep," the man whispered. "He's all right."
Two hours later Cohn appeared.
He came into the front room still with the wreath of garlics around his neck.
The Spaniards shouted when he came in.
Cohn wiped his eyes and grinned.
"I must have been sleeping," he said.
"Oh, not at all," Brett said.
"You were only dead," Bill said.
"Aren't we going to go and have some supper?" Cohn asked.
"Do you want to eat?"
"Yes. Why not? I'm hungry."
"Eat those garlics, Robert," Mike said. "I say. Do eat those garlics."
Cohn stood there.
His sleep had made him quite all right.
"Do let's go and eat," Brett said. "I must get a bath."
"Come on," Bill said. "Let's translate Brett to the hotel."
We said good-bye to many people and shook hands with many people and went out.
Outside it was dark.
"What time is it do you suppose?" Cohn asked.
"It's to-morrow," Mike said. "You've been asleep two days."
"No," said Cohn, "what time is it?"
"It's ten o'clock."
"What a lot we've drunk."
"You mean what a lot we've drunk. You went to sleep."
Going down the dark streets to the hotel we saw the sky-rockets going up in the square.
Down the side streets that led to the square we saw the square solid with people, those in the centre all dancing.
It was a big meal at the hotel.
It was the first meal of the prices being doubled for the fiesta, and there were several new courses.
After the dinner we were out in the town.
I remember resolving that I would stay up all night to watch the bulls go through the streets at six o'clock in the morning, and being so sleepy that I went to bed around four o'clock.
The others stayed up.
My own room was locked and I could not find the key, so I went up-stairs and slept on one of the beds in Cohn's room.
The fiesta was going on outside in the night, but I was too sleepy for it to keep me awake.
When I woke it was the sound of the rocket exploding that announced the release of the bulls from the corrals at the edge of town.
They would race through the streets and out to the bull-ring.
I had been sleeping heavily and I woke feeling I was too late.
I put on a coat of Cohn's and went out on the balcony.
Down below the narrow street was empty.
All the balconies were crowded with people.
Suddenly a crowd came down the street.
They were all running, packed close together.
They passed along and up the street toward the bull-ring and behind them came more men running faster, and then some stragglers who were really running.
Behind them was a little bare space, and then the bulls galloping, tossing their heads up and down.
It all went out of sight around the corner.
One man fell, rolled to the gutter, and lay quiet.
But the bulls went right on and did not notice him.
They were all running together.
After they went out of sight a great roar came from the bull-ring.
It kept on.
Then finally the pop of the rocket that meant the bulls had gotten through the people in the ring and into the corrals.
I went back in the room and got into bed.
I had been standing on the stone balcony in bare feet.
I knew our crowd must have all been out at the bull-ring.
Back in bed, I went to sleep.
Cohn woke me when he came in.
He started to undress and went over and closed the window because the people on the balcony of the house just across the street were looking in.
"Did you see the show?" I asked.
"Yes. We were all there."
"Anybody get hurt?"
"One of the bulls got into the crowd in the ring and tossed six or eight people."
"How did Brett like it?"
"It was all so sudden there wasn't any time for it to bother anybody."
"I wish I'd been up."
"We didn't know where you were. We went to your room but it was locked."
"Where did you stay up?"
"We danced at some club."
"I got sleepy," I said.
"My gosh! I'm sleepy now," Cohn said. "Doesn't this thing ever stop?"
"Not for a week."
Bill opened the door and put his head in.
"Where were you, Jake?"
"I saw them go through from the balcony. How was it?"
"Grand."
"Where you going?"
"To sleep."
No one was up before noon.
We ate at tables set out under the arcade.
The town was full of people.
We had to wait for a table.
After lunch we went over to the Iruña.
It had filled up, and as the time for the bull-fight came it got fuller, and the tables were crowded closer.
There was a close, crowded hum that came every day before the bull-fight.
The café did not make this same noise at any other time, no matter how crowded it was.
This hum went on, and we were in it and a part of it.
I had taken six seats for all the fights.
Three of them were barreras, the first row at the ring-side, and three were sobrepuertos, seats with wooden backs, half-way up the amphitheatre.
Mike thought Brett had best sit high up for her first time, and Cohn wanted to sit with them.
Bill and I were going to sit in the barreras, and I gave the extra ticket to a waiter to sell.
Bill said something to Cohn about what to do and how to look so he would not mind the horses.
Bill had seen one season of bull-fights.
"I'm not worried about how I'll stand it. I'm only afraid I may be bored," Cohn said.
"You think so?"
"Don't look at the horses, after the bull hits them," I said to Brett. "Watch the charge and see the picador try and keep the bull off, but then don't look again until the horse is dead if it's been hit."
"I'm a little nervy about it," Brett said. "I'm worried whether I'll be able to go through with it all right."
"You'll be all right. There's nothing but that horse part that will bother you, and they're only in for a few minutes with each bull. Just don't watch when it's bad."
"She'll be all right," Mike said. "I'll look after her."
"I don't think you'll be bored," Bill said.
"I'm going over to the hotel to get the glasses and the wine-skin," I said. "See you back here. Don't get cock-eyed."
"I'll come along," Bill said. Brett smiled at us.
We walked around through the arcade to avoid the heat of the square.
"That Cohn gets me," Bill said. "He's got this Jewish superiority so strong that he thinks the only emotion he'll get out of the fight will be being bored."
"We'll watch him with the glasses," I said.
"Oh, to hell with him!"
"He spends a lot of time there."
"I want him to stay there."
In the hotel on the stairs we met Montoya.
"Come on," said Montoya. "Do you want to meet Pedro Romero?"
"Fine," said Bill. "Let's go see him."
We followed Montoya up a flight and down the corridor.
"He's in room number eight," Montoya explained. "He's getting dressed for the bull-fight."
Montoya knocked on the door and opened it.
It was a gloomy room with a little light coming in from the window on the narrow street.
There were two beds separated by a monastic partition.
The electric light was on.
The boy stood very straight and unsmiling in his bull-fighting clothes.
His jacket hung over the back of a chair.
They were just finishing winding his sash.
His black hair shone under the electric light.
He wore a white linen shirt and the sword-handler finished his sash and stood up and stepped back.
Pedro Romero nodded, seeming very far away and dignified when we shook hands.
Montoya said something about what great aficionados we were, and that we wanted to wish him luck.
Romero listened very seriously.
Then he turned to me.
He was the best-looking boy I have ever seen.
"You go to the bull-fight," he said in English.
"You know English," I said, feeling like an idiot.
"No," he answered, and smiled.
One of three men who had been sitting on the beds came up and asked us if we spoke French.
"Would you like me to interpret for you? Is there anything you would like to ask Pedro Romero?".
We thanked him.
What was there that you would like to ask? The boy was nineteen years old, alone except for his sword-handler, and the three hangers-on, and the bull-fight was to commence in twenty minutes.
We wished him "Mucha suerte," shook hands, and went out.
He was standing, straight and handsome and altogether by himself, alone in the room with the hangers-on as we shut the door.
"He's a fine boy, don't you think so?" Montoya asked.
"He's a good-looking kid," I said.
"He looks like a torero," Montoya said. "He has the type."
"He's a fine boy."
"We'll see how he is in the ring," Montoya said.
We found the big leather wine-bottle leaning against the wall in my room, took it and the field-glasses, locked the door, and went down-stairs.
It was a good bull-light.
Bill and I were very excited about Pedro Romero.
Montoya was sitting about ten places away.
After Romero had killed his first bull Montoya caught my eye and nodded his head.
This was a real one.
There had not been a real one for a long time.
Of the other two matadors, one was very fair and the other was passable.
But there was no comparison with Romero, although neither of his bulls was much.
Several times during the bull-fight I looked up at Mike and Brett and Cohn, with the glasses.
They seemed to be all right.
Brett did not look upset.
All three were leaning forward on the concrete railing in front of them.
"Let me take the glasses," Bill said.
"Does Cohn look bored?" I asked.
"That kike!"
Outside the ring, after the bull-fight was over, you could not move in the crowd.
We could not make our way through but had to be moved with the whole thing, slowly, as a glacier, back to town.
We had that disturbed emotional feeling that always comes after a bull-fight, and the feeling of elation that comes after a good bull-fight.
The fiesta was going on.
The drums pounded and the pipe music was shrill, and everywhere the flow of the crowd was broken by patches of dancers.
The dancers were in a crowd, so you did not see the intricate play of the feet.
All you saw was the heads and shoulders going up and down, up and down.
Finally, we got out of the crowd and made for the café.
The waiter saved chairs for the others, and we each ordered an absinthe and watched the crowd in the square and the dancers.
"What do you suppose that dance is?" Bill asked.
"It's a sort of jota."
"They're not all the same," Bill said. "They dance differently to all the different tunes."
"It's swell dancing."
In front of us on a clear part of the street a company of boys were dancing.
The steps were very intricate and their faces were intent and concentrated.
They all looked down while they danced.
Their rope-soled shoes tapped and spatted on the pavement.
The toes touched.
The heels touched.
The balls of the feet touched.
Then the music broke wildly and the step was finished and they were all dancing on up the street.
"Here come the gentry," Bill said.
They were crossing the street.
"Hello, men," I said.
"Hello, gents!" said Brett. "You saved us seats? How nice."
"I say," Mike said, "that Romero what'shisname is somebody. Am I wrong?"
"Oh, isn't he lovely," Brett said. "And those green trousers."
"Brett never took her eyes off them."
"I say, I must borrow your glasses to-morrow."
"How did it go?"
"Wonderfully! Simply perfect. I say, it is a spectacle!"
"How about the horses?"
"I couldn't help looking at them."
"She couldn't take her eyes off them," Mike said. "She's an extraordinary wench."
"They do have some rather awful things happen to them," Brett said. "I couldn't look away, though."
"Did you feel all right?"
"I didn't feel badly at all."
"Robert Cohn did," Mike put in. "You were quite green, Robert."
"The first horse did bother me," Cohn said.
"You weren't bored, were you?" asked Bill.
Cohn laughed.
"No. I wasn't bored. I wish you'd forgive me that."
"It's all right," Bill said, "so long as you weren't bored."
"He didn't look bored," Mike said. "I thought he was going to be sick."
"I never felt that bad. It was just for a minute."
"I thought he was going to be sick. You weren't bored, were you, Robert?"
"Let up on that, Mike. I said I was sorry I said it."
"He was, you know. He was positively green."
"Oh, shove it along, Michael."
"You mustn't ever get bored at your first bull-fight, Robert," Mike said. "It might make such a mess."
"Oh, shove it along, Michael," Brett said.
"He said Brett was a sadist," Mike said. "Brett's not a sadist. She's just a lovely, healthy wench."
"Are you a sadist, Brett?" I asked.
"Hope not."
"He said Brett was a sadist just because she has a good, healthy stomach."
"Won't be healthy long."
Bill got Mike started on something else than Cohn.
The waiter brought the absinthe glasses.
"Did you really like it?" Bill asked Cohn.
"No, I can't say I liked it. I think it's a wonderful show."
"Gad, yes! What a spectacle!" Brett said.
"I wish they didn't have the horse part," Cohn said.
"They're not important," Bill said. "After a while you never notice anything disgusting."
"It is a bit strong just at the start," Brett said. "There's a dreadful moment for me just when the bull starts for the horse."
"The bulls were fine," Cohn said.
"They were very good," Mike said.
"I want to sit down below, next time." Brett drank from her glass of absinthe.
"She wants to see the bull-fighters close by," Mike said.
"They are something," Brett said. "That Romero lad is just a child."
"He's a damned good-looking boy," I said. "When we were up in his room I never saw a better-looking kid."
"How old do you suppose he is?"
"Nineteen or twenty."
"Just imagine it."
The bull-fight on the second day was much better than on the first.
Brett sat between Mike and me at the barrera, and Bill and Cohn went up above.
Romero was the whole show.
I do not think Brett saw any other bull-fighter.
No one else did either, except the hard-shelled technicians.
It was all Romero.
There were two other matadors, but they did not count.
I sat beside Brett and explained to Brett what it was all about.
I told her about watching the bull, not the horse, when the bulls charged the picadors, and got her to watching the picador place the point of his pic so that she saw what it was all about, so that it became more something that was going on with a definite end, and less of a spectacle with unexplained horrors.
I had her watch how Romero took the bull away from a fallen horse with his cape, and how he held him with the cape and turned him, smoothly and suavely, never wasting the bull.
She saw how Romero avoided every brusque movement and saved his bulls for the last when he wanted them, not winded and discomposed but smoothly worn down.
She saw how close Romero always worked to the bull, and I pointed out to her the tricks the other bull-fighters used to make it look as though they were working closely.
She saw why she liked Romero's cape-work and why she did not like the others.
Romero never made any contortions, always it was straight and pure and natural in line.
The others twisted themselves like corkscrews, their elbows raised, and leaned against the flanks of the bull after his horns had passed, to give a faked look of danger.
Afterward, all that was faked turned bad and gave an unpleasant feeling.
Romero's bull-fighting gave real emotion, because he kept the absolute purity of line in his movements and always quietly and calmly let the horns pass him close each time.
He did not have to emphasize their closeness.
Brett saw how something that was beautiful done close to the bull was ridiculous if it were done a little way off.
I told her how since the death of Joselito all the bull-fighters had been developing a technic that simulated this appearance of danger in order to give a fake emotional feeling, while the bull-fighter was really safe.
Romero had the old thing, the holding of his purity of line through the maximum of exposure, while he dominated the bull by making him realize he was unattainable, while he prepared him for the killing.
"I've never seen him do an awkward thing," Brett said.
"You won't until he gets frightened," I said.
"He'll never be frightened," Mike said. "He knows too damned much."
"He knew everything when he started. The others can't ever learn what he was born with."
"And God, what looks," Brett said.
"I believe, you know, that she's falling in love with this bull-fighter chap," Mike said.
"I wouldn't be surprised."
"Be a good chap, Jake. Don't tell her anything more about him. Tell her how they beat their old mothers."
"Tell me what drunks they are."
"Oh, frightful," Mike said. "Drunk all day and spend all their time beating their poor old mothers."
"He looks that way," Brett said.
"Doesn't he?" I said.
They had hitched the mules to the dead bull and then the whips cracked, the men ran, and the mules, straining forward, their legs pushing, broke into a gallop, and the bull, one horn up, his head on its side, swept a swath smoothly across the sand and out the red gate.
"This next is the last one."
"Not really," Brett said. She leaned forward on the barrera. Romero waved his picadors to their places, then stood, his cape against his chest, looking across the ring to where the bull would come out.
After it was over we went out and were pressed tight in the crowd.
"These bull-fights are hell on one," Brett said. "I'm limp as a rag."
"Oh, you'll get a drink," Mike said.
The next day Pedro Romero did not fight.
It was Miura bulls, and a very bad bull-fight.
The next day there was no bull-fight scheduled.
But all day and all night the fiesta kept on.
In the morning it was raining.
A fog had come over the mountains from the sea.
You could not see the tops of the mountains.
The plateau was dull and gloomy, and the shapes of the trees and the houses were changed.
I walked out beyond the town to look at the weather.
The bad weather was coming over the mountains from the sea.
The flags in the square hung wet from the white poles and the banners were wet and hung damp against the front of the houses, and in between the steady drizzle the rain came down and drove every one under the arcades and made pools of water in the square, and the streets wet and dark and deserted; yet the fiesta kept up without any pause.
It was only driven under cover.
The covered seats of the bull-ring had been crowded with people sitting out of the rain watching the concourse of Basque and Navarrais dancers and singers, and afterward the Val Carlos dancers in their costumes danced down the street in the rain, the drums sounding hollow and damp, and the chiefs of the bands riding ahead on their big, heavy-footed horses, their costumes wet, the horses' coats wet in the rain.
The crowd was in the cafés and the dancers came in, too, and sat, their tight-wound white legs under the tables, shaking the water from their belled caps, and spreading their red and purple jackets over the chairs to dry.
It was raining hard outside.
I left the crowd in the café and went over to the hotel to get shaved for dinner.
I was shaving in my room when there was a knock on the door.
"Come in," I called.
Montoya walked in.
"How are you?" he said.
"Fine," I said.
"No bulls to-day."
"No," I said, "nothing but rain."
"Where are your friends?"
"Over at the Iruña."
Montoya smiled his embarrassed smile.
"Look," he said. "Do you know the American ambassador?"
"Yes," I said. "Everybody knows the American ambassador."
"He's here in town, now."
"Yes," I said. "Everybody's seen them."
"I've seen them, too," Montoya said. He didn't say anything. I went on shaving.
"Sit down," I said. "Let me send for a drink."
"No, I have to go."
I finished shaving and put my face down into the bowl and washed it with cold water.
Montoya was standing there looking more embarrassed.
"Look," he said. "I've just had a message from them at the Grand Hotel that they want Pedro Romero and Marcial Lalanda to come over for coffee to-night after dinner."
"Well," I said, "it can't hurt Marcial any."
"Marcial has been in San Sebastian all day. He drove over in a car this morning with Marquez. I don't think they'll be back to-night."
Montoya stood embarrassed.
He wanted me to say something.
"Don't give Romero the message," I said.
"You think so?"
"Absolutely."
Montoya was very pleased.
"I wanted to ask you because you were an American," he said.
"That's what I'd do."
"Look," said Montoya. "People take a boy like that. They don't know what he's worth. They don't know what he means. Any foreigner can flatter him. They start this Grand Hotel business, and in one year they're through."
"Like Algabeno," I said.
"Yes, like Algabeno."
"They're a fine lot," I said. "There's one American woman down here now that collects bull-fighters."
"I know. They only want the young ones."
"Yes," I said. "The old ones get fat."
"Or crazy like Gallo."
"Well," I said, "it's easy. All you have to do is not give him the message."
"He's such a fine boy," said Montoya. "He ought to stay with his own people. He shouldn't mix in that stuff."
"Won't you have a drink?" I asked.
"No," said Montoya, "I have to go." He went out.
I went down-stairs and out the door and took a walk around through the arcades around the square.
It was still raining.
I looked in at the Iruña for the gang and they were not there, so I walked on around the square and back to the hotel.
They were eating dinner in the down-stairs dining-room.
They were well ahead of me and it was no use trying to catch them.
Bill was buying shoe-shines for Mike.
Bootblacks opened the street door and each one Bill called over and started to work on Mike.
"This is the eleventh time my boots have been polished," Mike said. "I say, Bill is an ass."
The bootblacks had evidently spread the report.
Another came in.
"Limpia botas?" he said to Bill.
"No," said Bill. "For this Señor."
The bootblack knelt down beside the one at work and started on Mike's free shoe that shone already in the electric light.
"Bill's a yell of laughter," Mike said.
I was drinking red wine, and so far behind them that I felt a little uncomfortable about all this shoe-shining.
I looked around the room.
At the next table was Pedro Romero.
He stood up when I nodded, and asked me to come over and meet a friend.
His table was beside ours, almost touching.
I met the friend, a Madrid bull-fight critic, a little man with a drawn face.
I told Romero how much I liked his work, and he was very pleased.
We talked Spanish and the critic knew a little French.
I reached to our table for my wine-bottle, but the critic took my arm.
Romero laughed.
"Drink here," he said in English.
He was very bashful about his English, but he was really very pleased with it, and as we went on talking he brought out words he was not sure of, and asked me about them.
He was anxious to know the English for Corrida de toros, the exact translation.
Bull-fight he was suspicious of.
I explained that bull-fight in Spanish was the lidia of a toro.
The Spanish word corrida means in English the running of bulls--the French translation is Course de taureaux.
The critic put that in.
There is no Spanish word for bull-fight.
Pedro Romero said he had learned a little English in Gibraltar.
He was born in Ronda.
That is not far above Gibraltar.
He started bull-fighting in Malaga in the bull-fighting school there.
He had only been at it three years.
The bull-fight critic joked him about the number of Malagueño expressions he used.
He was nineteen years old, he said.
His older brother was with him as a banderillero, but he did not live in this hotel.
He lived in a smaller hotel with the other people who worked for Romero.
He asked me how many times I had seen him in the ring.
I told him only three.
It was really only two, but I did not want to explain after I had made the mistake.
"Where did you see me the other time? In Madrid?"
"Yes," I lied. I had read the accounts of his two appearances in Madrid in the bull-fight papers, so I was all right.
"The first or the second time?"
"The first."
"I was very bad," he said. "The second time I was better. You remember?" He turned to the critic.
He was not at all embarrassed.
He talked of his work as something altogether apart from himself.
There was nothing conceited or braggartly about him.
"I like it very much that you like my work," he said. "But you haven't seen it yet. To-morrow, if I get a good bull, I will try and show it to you."
When he said this he smiled, anxious that neither the bull-fight critic nor I would think he was boasting.
"I am anxious to see it," the critic said. "I would like to be convinced."
"He doesn't like my work much." Romero turned to me. He was serious.
The critic explained that he liked it very much, but that so far it had been incomplete.
"Wait till to-morrow, if a good one comes out."
"Have you seen the bulls for to-morrow?" the critic asked me.
"Yes. I saw them unloaded."
Pedro Romero leaned forward.
"What did you think of them?"
"Very nice," I said. "About twenty-six arrobas. Very short horns. Haven't you seen them?"
"Oh, yes," said Romero.
"They won't weigh twenty-six arrobas," said the critic.
"No," said Romero.
"They've got bananas for horns," the critic said.
"You call them bananas?" asked Romero. He turned to me and smiled. "You wouldn't call them bananas?"
"No," I said. "They're horns all right."
"They're very short," said Pedro Romero. "Very, very short. Still, they aren't bananas."
"I say, Jake," Brett called from the next table, "you have deserted us."
"Just temporarily," I said. "We're talking bulls."
"You are superior."
"Tell him that bulls have no balls," Mike shouted. He was drunk.
Romero looked at me inquiringly.
"Drunk," I said. "Borracho! Muy borracho!"
"You might introduce your friends," Brett said. She had not stopped looking at Pedro Romero. I asked them if they would like to have coffee with us. They both stood up. Romero's face was very brown. He had very nice manners.
I introduced them all around and they started to sit down, but there was not enough room, so we all moved over to the big table by the wall to have coffee.
Mike ordered a bottle of Fundador and glasses for everybody.
There was a lot of drunken talking.
"Tell him I think writing is lousy," Bill said. "Go on, tell him. Tell him I'm ashamed of being a writer."
Pedro Romero was sitting beside Brett and listening to her.
"Go on. Tell him!" Bill said.
Romero looked up smiling.
"This gentleman," I said, "is a writer."
Romero was impressed.
"This other one, too," I said, pointing at Cohn.
"He looks like Villalta," Romero said, looking at Bill. "Rafael, doesn't he look like Villalta?"
"I can't see it," the critic said.
"Really," Romero said in Spanish. "He looks a lot like Villalta. What does the drunken one do?"
"Nothing."
"Is that why he drinks?"
"No. He's waiting to marry this lady."
"Tell him bulls have no balls!" Mike shouted, very drunk, from the other end of the table.
"What does he say?"
"He's drunk."
"Jake," Mike called. "Tell him bulls have no balls!"
"You understand?" I said.
"Yes."
I was sure he didn't, so it was all right.
"Tell him Brett wants to see him put on those green pants."
"Pipe down, Mike."
"Tell him Brett is dying to know how he can get into those pants."
"Pipe down."
During this Romero was fingering his glass and talking with Brett.
Brett was talking French and he was talking Spanish and a little English, and laughing.
Bill was filling the glasses.
"Tell him Brett wants to come into----"
"Oh, pipe down, Mike, for Christ's sake!"
Romero looked up smiling.
"Pipe down! I know that," he said.
Just then Montoya came into the room.
He started to smile at me, then he saw Pedro Romero with a big glass of cognac in his hand, sitting laughing between me and a woman with bare shoulders, at a table full of drunks.
He did not even nod.
Montoya went out of the room.
Mike was on his feet proposing a toast.
"Let's all drink to--" he began.
"Pedro Romero," I said.
Everybody stood up.
Romero took it very seriously, and we touched glasses and drank it down, I rushing it a little because Mike was trying to make it clear that that was not at all what he was going to drink to.
But it went off all right, and Pedro Romero shook hands with every one and he and the critic went out together.
"My God! he's a lovely boy," Brett said. "And how I would love to see him get into those clothes. He must use a shoe-horn."
"I started to tell him," Mike began. "And Jake kept interrupting me. Why do you interrupt me? Do you think you talk Spanish better than I do?"
"Oh, shut up, Mike! Nobody interrupted you."
"No, I'd like to get this settled." He turned away from me. "Do you think you amount to something, Cohn? Do you think you belong here among us? People who are out to have a good time? For God's sake don't be so noisy, Cohn!"
"Oh, cut it out, Mike," Cohn said.
"Do you think Brett wants you here? Do you think you add to the party? Why don't you say something?"
"I said all I had to say the other night, Mike."
"I'm not one of you literary chaps." Mike stood shakily and leaned against the table. "I'm not clever. But I do know when I'm not wanted. Why don't you see when you're not wanted, Cohn? Go away. Go away, for God's sake. Take that sad Jewish face away. Don't you think I'm right?"
He looked at us.
"Sure," I said. "Let's all go over to the Iruña."
"No. Don't you think I'm right? I love that woman."
"Oh, don't start that again. Do shove it along, Michael," Brett said.
"Don't you think I'm right, Jake?"
Cohn still sat at the table.
His face had the sallow, yellow look it got when he was insulted, but somehow he seemed to be enjoying it.
The childish, drunken heroics of it.
It was his affair with a lady of title.
"Jake," Mike said. He was almost crying. "You know I'm right. Listen, you!" He turned to Cohn: "Go away! Go away now!"
"But I won't go, Mike," said Cohn.
"Then I'll make you!" Mike started toward him around the table. Cohn stood up and took off his glasses. He stood waiting, his face sallow, his hands fairly low, proudly and firmly waiting for the assault, ready to do battle for his lady love.
I grabbed Mike.
"Come on to the café," I said.
"You can't hit him here in the hotel.
"Good!" said Mike. "Good idea!"
We started off.
I looked back as Mike stumbled up the stairs and saw Cohn putting his glasses on again.
Bill was sitting at the table pouring another glass of Fundador.
Brett was sitting looking straight ahead at nothing.
Outside on the square it had stopped raining and the moon was trying to get through the clouds.
There was a wind blowing.
The military band was playing and the crowd was massed on the far side of the square where the fireworks specialist and his son were trying to send up fire balloons.
A balloon would start up jerkily, on a great bias, and be torn by the wind or blown against the houses of the square.
Some fell into the crowd.
The magnesium flared and the fireworks exploded and chased about in the crowd.
There was no one dancing in the square.
The gravel was too wet.
Brett came out with Bill and joined us.
We stood in the crowd and watched Don Manuel Orquito, the fireworks king, standing on a little platform, carefully starting the balloons with sticks, standing above the heads of the crowd to launch the balloons off into the wind.
The wind brought them all down, and Don Manuel Orquito's face was sweaty in the light of his complicated fireworks that fell into the crowd and charged and chased, sputtering and cracking, between the legs of the people.
The people shouted as each new luminous paper bubble careened, caught fire, and fell.
"They're razzing Don Manuel," Bill said.
"How do you know he's Don Manuel?" Brett said.
"His name's on the programme. Don Manuel Orquito, the pirotecnico of esta ciudad."
"Globos illuminados," Mike said. "A collection of globos illuminados. That's what the paper said."
The wind blew the band music away.
"I say, I wish one would go up," Brett said. "That Don Manuel chap is furious."
"He's probably worked for weeks fixing them to go off, spelling out 'Hail to San Fermin,'" Bill said.
"Globos illuminados," Mike said. "A bunch of bloody globos illuminados."
"Come on," said Brett. "We can't stand here."
"Her ladyship wants a drink," Mike said.
"How you know things," Brett said.
Inside, the café was crowded and very noisy.
No one noticed us come in.
We could not find a table.
There was a great noise going on.
"Come on, let's get out of here," Bill said.
Outside the paseo was going in under the arcade.
There were some English and Americans from Biarritz in sport clothes scattered at the tables.
Some of the women stared at the people going by with lorgnons.
We had acquired, at some time, a friend of Bill's from Biarritz.
She was staying with another girl at the Grand Hotel.
The other girl had a headache and had gone to bed.
"Here's the pub," Mike said. It was the Bar Milano, a small, tough bar where you could get food and where they danced in the back room. We all sat down at a table and ordered a bottle of Fundador. The bar was not full. There was nothing going on.
"This is a hell of a place," Bill said.
"It's too early."
"Let's take the bottle and come back later," Bill said. "I don't want to sit here on a night like this."
"Let's go and look at the English," Mike said. "I love to look at the English."
"They're awful," Bill said. "Where did they all come from?"
"They come from Biarritz," Mike said, "They come to see the last day of the quaint little Spanish fiesta."
"I'll festa them," Bill said.
"You're an extraordinarily beautiful girl." Mike turned to Bill's friend. "When did you come here?"
"Come off it, Michael."
"I say, she is a lovely girl. Where have I been? Where have I been looking all this while? You're a lovely thing. Have we met? Come along with me and Bill. We're going to festa the English."
"I'll festa them," Bill said, "What the hell are they doing at this fiesta?"
"Come on," Mike said. "Just us three. We're going to festa the bloody English. I hope you're not English? I'm Scotch. I hate the English. I'm going to festa them. Come on, Bill."
Through the window we saw them, all three arm in arm, going toward the café.
Rockets were going up in the square.
"I'm going to sit here," Brett said.
"I'll stay with you," Cohn said.
"Oh, don't!" Brett said. "For God's sake, go off somewhere. Can't you see Jake and I want to talk?"
"I didn't," Cohn said. "I thought I'd sit here because I felt a little tight."
"What a hell of a reason for sitting with any one. If you're tight, go to bed. Go on to bed."
"Was I rude enough to him?" Brett asked. Cohn was gone. "My God! I'm so sick of him!"
"He doesn't add much to the gayety."
"He depresses me so."
"He's behaved very badly."
"Damned badly. He had a chance to behave so well."
"He's probably waiting just outside the door now."
"Yes. He would. You know I do know how he feels. He can't believe it didn't mean anything."
"I know."
"Nobody else would behave as badly. Oh, I'm so sick of the whole thing. And Michael. Michael's been lovely, too."
"It's been damned hard on Mike."
"Yes. But he didn't need to be a swine."
"Everybody behaves badly," I said. "Give them the proper chance."
"You wouldn't behave badly." Brett looked at me.
"I'd be as big an ass as Cohn," I said.
"Darling, don't let's talk a lot of rot."
"All right. Talk about anything you like."
"Don't be difficult. You're the only person I've got, and I feel rather awful to-night."
"You've got Mike."
"Yes, Mike. Hasn't he been pretty?"
"Well," I said, "it's been damned hard on Mike, having Cohn around and seeing him with you."
"Don't I know it, darling? Please don't make me feel any worse than I do."
Brett was nervous as I had never seen her before.
She kept looking away from me and looking ahead at the wall.
"Want to go for a walk?"
"Yes. Come on."
I corked up the Fundador bottle and gave it to the bartender.
"Let's have one more drink of that," Brett said. "My nerves are rotten."
We each drank a glass of the smooth amontillado brandy.
"Come on," said Brett.
As we came out the door I saw Cohn walk out from under the arcade.
"He was there," Brett said.
"He can't be away from you."
"Poor devil!"
"I'm not sorry for him. I hate him, myself."
"I hate him, too," she shivered. "I hate his damned suffering."
We walked arm in arm down the side street away from the crowd and the lights of the square.
The street was dark and wet, and we walked along it to the fortifications at the edge of town.
We passed wine-shops with light coming out from their doors onto the black, wet street, and sudden bursts of music.
"Want to go in?"
"No."
We walked out across the wet grass and onto the stone wall of the fortifications.
I spread a newspaper on the stone and Brett sat down.
Across the plain it was dark, and we could see the mountains.
The wind was high up and took the clouds across the moon.
Below us were the dark pits of the fortifications.
Behind were the trees and the shadow of the cathedral, and the town silhouetted against the moon.
"Don't feel bad," I said.
"I feel like hell," Brett said. "Don't let's talk."
We looked out at the plain.
The long lines of trees were dark in the moonlight.
There were the lights of a car on the road climbing the mountain.
Up on the top of the mountain we saw the lights of the fort.
Below to the left was the river.
It was high from the rain, and black and smooth.
Trees were dark along the banks.
We sat and looked out.
Brett stared straight ahead.
Suddenly she shivered.
"It's cold."
"Want to walk back?"
"Through the park."
We climbed down.
It was clouding over again.
In the park it was dark under the trees.
"Do you still love me, Jake?"
"Yes," I said.
"Because I'm a goner," Brett said.
"How?"
"I'm a goner. I'm mad about the Romero boy. I'm in love with him, I think."
"I wouldn't be if I were you."
"I can't help it. I'm a goner. It's tearing me all up inside."
"Don't do it."
"I can't help it. I've never been able to help anything."
"You ought to stop it."
"How can I stop it? I can't stop things. Feel that?"
Her hand was trembling.
"I'm like that all through."
"You oughtn't to do it."
"I can't help it. I'm a goner now, anyway. Don't you see the difference?"
"No."
"I've got to do something. I've got to do something I really want to do. I've lost my self-respect."
"You don't have to do that."
"Oh, darling, don't be difficult. What do you think it's meant to have that damned Jew about, and Mike the way he's acted?"
"Sure."
"I can't just stay tight all the time."
"No."
"Oh, darling, please stay by me. Please stay by me and see me through this."
"Sure."
"I don't say it's right. It is right though for me. God knows, I've never felt such a bitch."
"What do you want me to do?"
"Come on," Brett said. "Let's go and find him."
Together we walked down the gravel path in the park in the dark, under the trees and then out from under the trees and past the gate into the street that led into town.
Pedro Romero was in the café.
He was at a table with other bull-fighters and bull-fight critics.
They were smoking cigars.
When we came in they looked up.
Romero smiled and bowed.
We sat down at a table half-way down the room.
"Ask him to come over and have a drink."
"Not yet. He'll come over."
"I can't look at him."
"He's nice to look at," I said.
"I've always done just what I wanted."
"I know."
"I do feel such a bitch."
"Well," I said.
"My God!" said Brett, "the things a woman goes through."
"Yes?"
"Oh, I do feel such a bitch."
I looked across at the table.
Pedro Romero smiled.
He said something to the other people at his table, and stood up.
He came over to our table.
I stood up and we shook hands.
"Won't you have a drink?"
"You must have a drink with me," he said. He seated himself, asking Brett's permission without saying anything. He had very nice manners. But he kept on smoking his cigar. It went well with his face.
"You like cigars?" I asked.
"Oh, yes. I always smoke cigars."
It was part of his system of authority.
It made him seem older.
I noticed his skin.
It was clear and smooth and very brown.
There was a triangular scar on his cheek-bone.
I saw he was watching Brett.
He felt there was something between them.
He must have felt it when Brett gave him her hand.
He was being very careful.
I think he was sure, but he did not want to make any mistake.
"You fight to-morrow?" I said.
"Yes," he said. "Algabeno was hurt to-day in Madrid. Did you hear?"
"No," I said. "Badly?"
He shook his head.
"Nothing. Here," he showed his hand. Brett reached out and spread the fingers apart.
"Oh!" he said in English, "you tell fortunes?"
"Sometimes. Do you mind?"
"No. I like it." He spread his hand flat on the table. "Tell me I live for always, and be a millionaire."
He was still very polite, but he was surer of himself.
"Look," he said, "do you see any bulls in my hand?".
He laughed.
His hand was very fine and the wrist was small.
"There are thousands of bulls," Brett said. She was not at all nervous now. She looked lovely.
"Good," Romero laughed. "At a thousand duros apiece," he said to me in Spanish. "Tell me some more."
"It's a good hand," Brett said. "I think he'll live a long time."
"Say it to me. Not to your friend."
"I said you'd live a long time."
"I know it," Romero said. "I'm never going to die."
I tapped with my finger-tips on the table.
Romero saw it.
He shook his head.
"No. Don't do that. The bulls are my best friends."
I translated to Brett.
"You kill your friends?" she asked.
"Always," he said in English, and laughed. "So they don't kill me." He looked at her across the table.
"You know English well."
"Yes," he said. "Pretty well, sometimes. But I must not let anybody know. It would be very bad, a torero who speaks English."
"Why?" asked Brett.
"It would be bad. The people would not like it. Not yet."
"Why not?"
"They would not like it. Bull-fighters are not like that."
"What are bull-fighters like?"
He laughed and tipped his hat down over his eyes and changed the angle of his cigar and the expression of his face.
"Like at the table," he said. I glanced over. He had mimicked exactly the expression of Nacional. He smiled, his face natural again. "No. I must forget English."
"Don't forget it, yet," Brett said.
"No?"
"No."
"All right."
He laughed again.
"I would like a hat like that," Brett said.
"Good. I'll get you one."
"Right. See that you do."
"I will. I'll get you one to-night."
I stood up.
Romero rose, too.
"Sit down," I said. "I must go and find our friends and bring them here."
He looked at me.
It was a final look to ask if it were understood.
It was understood all right.
"Sit down," Brett said to him. "You must teach me Spanish."
He sat down and looked at her across the table.
I went out.
The hard-eyed people at the bull-fighter table watched me go.
It was not pleasant.
When I came back and looked in the café, twenty minutes later, Brett and Pedro Romero were gone.
The coffee-glasses and our three empty cognac-glasses were on the table.
A waiter came with a cloth and picked up the glasses and mopped off the table.
Outside the Bar Milano I found Bill and Mike and Edna.
Edna was the girl's name.
"We've been thrown out," Edna said.
"By the police," said Mike. "There's some people in there that don't like me."
"I've kept them out of four fights," Edna said. "You've got to help me."
Bill's face was red.
"Come back in, Edna," he said. "Go on in there and dance with Mike."
"It's silly," Edna said. "There'll just be another row."
"Damned Biarritz swine," Bill said.
"Come on," Mike said. "After all, it's a pub. They can't occupy a whole pub."
"Good old Mike," Bill said. "Damned English swine come here and insult Mike and try and spoil the fiesta."
"They're so bloody," Mike said. "I hate the English."
"They can't insult Mike," Bill said. "Mike is a swell fellow. They can't insult Mike. I won't stand it. Who cares if he is a damn bankrupt?" His voice broke.
"Who cares?" Mike said. "I don't care. Jake doesn't care. Do you care?"
"No," Edna said. "Are you a bankrupt?"
"Of course I am. You don't care, do you, Bill?"
Bill put his arm around Mike's shoulder.
"I wish to hell I was a bankrupt. I'd show those bastards."
"They're just English," Mike said. "It never makes any difference what the English say."
"The dirty swine," Bill said. "I'm going to clean them out."
"Bill," Edna looked at me. "Please don't go in again, Bill. They're so stupid."
"That's it," said Mike. "They're stupid. I knew that was what it was."
"They can't say things like that about Mike," Bill said.
"Do you know them?" I asked Mike.
"No. I never saw them. They say they know me."
"I won't stand it," Bill said.
"Come on. Let's go over to the Suizo," I said.
"They're a bunch of Edna's friends from Biarritz," Bill said.
"They're simply stupid," Edna said.
"One of them's Charley Blackman, from Chicago," Bill said.
"I was never in Chicago," Mike said.
Edna started to laugh and could not stop.
"Take me away from here," she said, "you bankrupts."
"What kind of a row was it?" I asked Edna. We were walking across the square to the Suizo. Bill was gone.
"I don't know what happened, but some one had the police called to keep Mike out of the back room. There were some people that had known Mike at Cannes. What's the matter with Mike?"
"Probably he owes them money" I said. "That's what people usually get bitter about."
In front of the ticket-booths out in the square there were two lines of people waiting.
They were sitting on chairs or crouched on the ground with blankets and newspapers around them.
They were waiting for the wickets to open in the morning to buy tickets for the bull-fight.
The night was clearing and the moon was out.
Some of the people in the line were sleeping.
At the Café Suizo we had just sat down and ordered Fundador when Robert Cohn came up.
"Where's Brett?" he asked.
"I don't know."
"She was with you."
"She must have gone to bed."
"She's not."
"I don't know where she is."
His face was sallow under the light.
He was standing up.
"Tell me where she is."
"Sit down," I said. "I don't know where she is."
"The hell you don't!"
"You can shut your face."
"Tell me where Brett is."
"I'll not tell you a damn thing."
"You know where she is."
"If I did I wouldn't tell you."
"Oh, go to hell, Cohn," Mike called from the table. "Brett's gone off with the bull-fighter chap. They're on their honeymoon."
"You shut up."
"Oh, go to hell!" Mike said languidly.
"Is that where she is?" Cohn turned to me.
"Go to hell!"
"She was with you. Is that where she is?"
"Go to hell!"
"I'll make you tell me"--he stepped forward--"you damned pimp."
I swung at him and he ducked.
I saw his face duck sideways in the light.
He hit me and I sat down on the pavement.
As I started to get on my feet he hit me twice.
I went down backward under a table.
I tried to get up and felt I did not have any legs.
I felt I must get on my feet and try and hit him.
Mike helped me up.
Some one poured a carafe of water on my head.
Mike had an arm around me, and I found I was sitting on a chair.
Mike was pulling at my ears.
"I say, you were cold," Mike said.
"Where the hell were you?"
"Oh, I was around."
"You didn't want to mix in it?"
"He knocked Mike down, too," Edna said.
"He didn't knock me out," Mike said. "I just lay there."
"Does this happen every night at your fiestas?" Edna asked. "Wasn't that Mr. Cohn?"
"I'm all right," I said. "My head's a little wobbly."
There were several waiters and a crowd of people standing around.
"Vaya!" said Mike. "Get away. Go on."
The waiters moved the people away.
"It was quite a thing to watch," Edna said. "He must be a boxer."
"He is."
"I wish Bill had been here," Edna said. "I'd like to have seen Bill knocked down, too. I've always wanted to see Bill knocked down. He's so big."
"I was hoping he would knock down a waiter," Mike said, "and get arrested. I'd like to see Mr. Robert Cohn in jail."
"No," I said.
"Oh, no," said Edna. "You don't mean that."
"I do, though," Mike said. "I'm not one of these chaps likes being knocked about. I never play games, even."
Mike took a drink.
"I never liked to hunt, you know. There was always the danger of having a horse fall on you. How do you feel, Jake?"
"All right."
"You're nice," Edna said to Mike. "Are you really a bankrupt?"
"I'm a tremendous bankrupt," Mike said. "I owe money to everybody. Don't you owe any money?"
"Tons."
"I owe everybody money," Mike said. "I borrowed a hundred pesetas from Montoya to-night."
"The hell you did," I said.
"I'll pay it back," Mike said. "I always pay everything back."
"That's why you're a bankrupt, isn't it?" Edna said.
I stood up.
I had heard them talking from a long way away.
It all seemed like some bad play.
"I'm going over to the hotel," I said. Then I heard them talking about me.
"Is he all right?" Edna asked.
"We'd better walk with him."
"I'm all right," I said. "Don't come. I'll see you all later."
I walked away from the café.
They were sitting at the table.
I looked back at them and at the empty tables.
There was a waiter sitting at one of the tables with his head in his hands.
Walking across the square to the hotel everything looked new and changed.
I had never seen the trees before.
I had never seen the flagpoles before, nor the front of the theatre.
It was all different.
I felt as I felt once coming home from an out-of-town football game.
I was carrying a suitcase with my football things in it, and I walked up the street from the station in the town I had lived in all my life and it was all new.
They were raking the lawns and burning leaves in the road, and I stopped for a long time and watched.
It was all strange.
Then I went on, and my feet seemed to be a long way off, and everything seemed to come from a long way off, and I could hear my feet walking a great distance away.
I had been kicked in the head early in the game.
It was like that crossing the square.
It was like that going up the stairs in the hotel.
Going up the stairs took a long time, and I had the feeling that I was carrying my suitcase.
There was a light in the room.
Bill came out and met me in the hall.
"Say," he said, "go up and see Cohn. He's been in a jam, and he's asking for you."
"The hell with him."
"Go on. Go on up and see him."
I did not want to climb another flight of stairs.
"What are you looking at me that way for?"
"I'm not looking at you. Go on up and see Cohn. He's in bad shape."
"You were drunk a little while ago," I said.
"I'm drunk now," Bill said. "But you go up and see Cohn. He wants to see you."
"All right," I said. It was just a matter of climbing more stairs. I went on up the stairs carrying my phantom suitcase. I walked down the hall to Cohn's room. The door was shut and I knocked.
"Who is it?"
"Barnes."
"Come in, Jake."
I opened the door and went in, and set down my suitcase.
There was no light in the room.
Cohn was lying, face down, on the bed in the dark.
"Hello, Jake."
"Don't call me Jake."
I stood by the door.
It was just like this that I had come home.
Now it was a hot bath that I needed.
A deep, hot bath, to lie back in.
"Where's the bathroom?" I asked.
Cohn was crying.
There he was, face down on the bed, crying.
He had on a white polo shirt, the kind he'd worn at Princeton.
"I'm sorry, Jake. Please forgive me."
"Forgive you, hell."
"Please forgive me, Jake."
I did not say anything.
I stood there by the door.
"I was crazy. You must see how it was."
"Oh, that's all right."
"I couldn't stand it about Brett."
"You called me a pimp."
I did not care.
I wanted a hot bath.
I wanted a hot bath in deep water.
"I know. Please don't remember it. I was crazy."
"That's all right."
He was crying.
His voice was funny.
He lay there in his white shirt on the bed in the dark.
His polo shirt.
"I'm going away in the morning."
He was crying without making any noise.
"I just couldn't stand it about Brett. I've been through hell, Jake. It's been simply hell. When I met her down here Brett treated me as though I were a perfect stranger. I just couldn't stand it. We lived together at San Sebastian. I suppose you know it. I can't stand it any more."
He lay there on the bed.
"Well," I said, "I'm going to take a bath."
"You were the only friend I had, and I loved Brett so."
"Well," I said, "so long."
"I guess it isn't any use," he said. "I guess it isn't any damn use."
"What?"
"Everything. Please say you forgive me, Jake."
"Sure," I said. "It's all right."
"I felt so terribly. I've been through such hell, Jake. Now everything's gone. Everything."
"Well," I said, "so long. I've got to go."
He rolled over, sat on the edge of the bed, and then stood up.
"So long, Jake," he said. "You'll shake hands, won't you?"
"Sure. Why not?"
We shook hands.
In the dark I could not see his face very well.
"Well," I said, "see you in the morning."
"I'm going away in the morning."
"Oh, yes," I said.
I went out.
Cohn was standing in the door of the room.
"Are you all right, Jake?" he asked.
"Oh, yes," I said. "I'm all right."
I could not find the bathroom.
After a while I found it.
There was a deep stone tub.
I turned on the taps and the water would not run.
I sat down on the edge of the bath-tub.
When I got up to go I found I had taken off my shoes.
I hunted for them and found them and carried them down-stairs.
I found my room and went inside and undressed and got into bed.
* * * * *.
I woke with a headache and the noise of the bands going by in the street.
I remembered I had promised to take Bill's friend Edna to see the bulls go through the street and into the ring.
I dressed and went down-stairs and out into the cold early morning.
People were crossing the square, hurrying toward the bull-ring.
Across the square were the two lines of men in front of the ticket-booths.
They were still waiting for the tickets to go on sale at seven o'clock.
I hurried across the street to the café.
The waiter told me that my friends had been there and gone.
"How many were they?"
"Two gentlemen and a lady."
That was all right.
Bill and Mike were with Edna.
She had been afraid last night they would pass out.
That was why I was to be sure to take her.
I drank the coffee and hurried with the other people toward the bull-ring.
I was not groggy now.
There was only a bad headache.
Everything looked sharp and clear, and the town smelt of the early morning.
The stretch of ground from the edge of the town to the bull-ring was muddy.
There was a crowd all along the fence that led to the ring, and the outside balconies and the top of the bull-ring were solid with people.
I heard the rocket and I knew I could not get into the ring in time to see the bulls come in, so I shoved through the crowd to the fence.
I was pushed close against the planks of the fence.
Between the two fences of the runway the police were clearing the crowd along.
They walked or trotted on into the bull-ring.
Then people commenced to come running.
A drunk slipped and fell.
Two policemen grabbed him and rushed him over to the fence.
The crowd were running fast now.
There was a great shout from the crowd, and putting my head through between the boards I saw the bulls just coming out of the street into the long running pen.
They were going fast and gaining on the crowd.
Just then another drunk started out from the fence with a blouse in his hands.
He wanted to do capework with the bulls.
The two policemen tore out, collared him, one hit him with a club, and they dragged him against the fence and stood flattened out against the fence as the last of the crowd and the bulls went by.
There were so many people running ahead of the bulls that the mass thickened and slowed up going through the gate into the ring, and as the bulls passed, galloping together, heavy, muddy-sided, horns swinging, one shot ahead, caught a man in the running crowd in the back and lifted him in the air.
Both the man's arms were by his sides, his head went back as the horn went in, and the bull lifted him and then dropped him.
The bull picked another man running in front, but the man disappeared into the crowd, and the crowd was through the gate and into the ring with the bulls behind them.
The red door of the ring went shut, the crowd on the outside balconies of the bull-ring were pressing through to the inside, there was a shout, then another shout.
The man who had been gored lay face down in the trampled mud.
People climbed over the fence, and I could not see the man because the crowd was so thick around him.
From inside the ring came the shouts.
Each shout meant a charge by some bull into the crowd.
You could tell by the degree of intensity in the shout how bad a thing it was that was happening.
Then the rocket went up that meant the steers had gotten the bulls out of the ring and into the corrals.
I left the fence and started back toward the town.
Back in the town I went to the café to have a second coffee and some buttered toast.
The waiters were sweeping out the café and mopping off the tables.
One came over and took my order.
"Anything happen at the encierro?"
"I didn't see it all. One man was badly cogido."
"Where?"
"Here." I put one hand on the small of my back and the other on my chest, where it looked as though the horn must have come through. The waiter nodded his head and swept the crumbs from the table with his cloth.
"Badly cogido," he said. "All for sport. All for pleasure."
He went away and came back with the long-handled coffee and milk pots.
He poured the milk and coffee.
It came out of the long spouts in two streams into the big cup.
The waiter nodded his head.
"Badly cogido through the back," he said. He put the pots down on the table and sat down in the chair at the table. "A big horn wound. All for fun. Just for fun. What do you think of that?"
"I don't know."
"That's it. All for fun. Fun, you understand."
"You're not an aficionado?"
"Me? What are bulls? Animals. Brute animals." He stood up and put his hand on the small of his back. "Right through the back. A cornada right through the back. For fun--you understand."
He shook his head and walked away, carrying the coffee-pots.
Two men were going by in the street.
The waiter shouted to them.
They were grave-looking.
One shook his head.
"Muerto!" he called.
The waiter nodded his head.
The two men went on.
They were on some errand.
The waiter came over to my table.
"You hear? Muerto. Dead. He's dead. With a horn through him. All for morning fun. Es muy flamenco."
"It's bad."
"Not for me," the waiter said. "No fun in that for me."
Later in the day we learned that the man who was killed was named Vicente Girones, and came from near Tafalla.
The next day in the paper we read that he was twenty-eight years old, and had a farm, a wife, and two children.
He had continued to come to the fiesta each year after he was married.
The next day his wife came in from Tafalla to be with the body, and the day after there was a service in the chapel of San Fermin, and the coffin was carried to the railway-station by members of the dancing and drinking society of Tafalla.
The drums marched ahead, and there was music on the fifes, and behind the men who carried the coffin walked the wife and two children.
Behind them marched all the members of the dancing and drinking societies of Pamplona, Estella, Tafalla, and Sanguesa who could stay over for the funeral.
The coffin was loaded into the baggage-car of the train, and the widow and the two children rode, sitting, all three together, in an open third-class railway-carriage.
The train started with a jerk, and then ran smoothly, going down grade around the edge of the plateau and out into the fields of grain that blew in the wind on the plain on the way to Tafalla.
The bull who killed Vicente Girones was named Bocanegra, was Number 118 of the bull-breeding establishment of Sanchez Tabemo, and was killed by Pedro Romero as the third bull of that same afternoon.
His ear was cut by popular acclamation and given to Pedro Romero, who, in turn, gave it to Brett, who wrapped it in a handkerchief belonging to myself, and left both ear and handkerchief, along with a number of Muratti cigarette-stubs, shoved far back in the drawer of the bed-table that stood beside her bed in the Hotel Montoya, in Pamplona.
* * * * *.
Back in the hotel, the night watchman was sitting on a bench inside the door.
He had been there all night and was very sleepy.
He stood up as I came in.
Three of the waitresses came in at the same time.
They had been to the morning show at the bull-ring.
They went up-stairs laughing.
I followed them up-stairs and went into my room.
I took off my shoes and lay down on the bed.
The window was open onto the balcony and the sunlight was bright in the room.
I did not feel sleepy.
It must have been half past three o'clock when I had gone to bed and the bands had waked me at six.
My jaw was sore on both sides.
I felt it with my thumb and fingers.
That damn Cohn.
He should have hit somebody the first time he was insulted, and then gone away.
He was so sure that Brett loved him.
He was going to stay, and true love would conquer all.
Some one knocked on the door.
"Come in."
It was Bill and Mike.
They sat down on the bed.
"Some encierro," Bill said. "Some encierro."
"I say, weren't you there?" Mike asked. "Ring for some beer, Bill."
"What a morning!" Bill said. He mopped off his face. "My God! what a morning! And here's old Jake. Old Jake, the human punching-bag."
"What happened inside?"
"Good God!" Bill said, "what happened, Mike?"
"There were these bulls coming in," Mike said. "Just ahead of them was the crowd, and some chap tripped and brought the whole lot of them down."
"And the bulls all came in right over them," Bill said.
"I heard them yell."
"That was Edna," Bill said.
"Chaps kept coming out and waving their shirts."
"One bull went along the barrera and hooked everybody over."
"They took about twenty chaps to the infirmary," Mike said.
"What a morning!" Bill said. "The damn police kept arresting chaps that wanted to go and commit suicide with the bulls."
"The steers took them in, in the end," Mike said.
"It took about an hour."
"It was really about a quarter of an hour," Mike objected.
"Oh, go to hell," Bill said. "You've been in the war. It was two hours and a half for me."
"Where's that beer?" Mike asked.
"What did you do with the lovely Edna?"
"We took her home just now. She's gone to bed."
"How did she like it?"
"Fine. We told her it was just like that every morning."
"She was impressed," Mike said.
"She wanted us to go down in the ring, too," Bill said. "She likes action."
"I said it wouldn't be fair to my creditors," Mike said.
"What a morning," Bill said. "And what a night!"
"How's your jaw, Jake?" Mike asked.
"Sore," I said.
Bill laughed.
"Why didn't you hit him with a chair?"
"You can talk," Mike said. "He'd have knocked you out, too. I never saw him hit me. I rather think I saw him just before, and then quite suddenly I was sitting down in the street, and Jake was lying under a table."
"Where did he go afterward?" I asked.
"Here she is," Mike said. "Here's the beautiful lady with the beer."
The chambermaid put the tray with the beer-bottles and glasses down on the table.
"Now bring up three more bottles," Mike said.
"Where did Cohn go after he hit me?" I asked Bill.
"Don't you know about that?" Mike was opening a beer-bottle. He poured the beer into one of the glasses, holding the glass close to the bottle.
"Really?" Bill asked.
"Why he went in and found Brett and the bull-fighter chap in the bull-fighter's room, and then he massacred the poor, bloody bull-fighter."
"No."
"Yes."
"What a night!" Bill said.
"He nearly killed the poor, bloody bull-fighter. Then Cohn wanted to take Brett away. Wanted to make an honest woman of her, I imagine. Damned touching scene."
He took a long drink of the beer.
"He is an ass."
"What happened?"
"Brett gave him what for. She told him off. I think she was rather good."
"I'll bet she was," Bill said.
"Then Cohn broke down and cried, and wanted to shake hands with the bull-fighter fellow. He wanted to shake hands with Brett, too."
"I know. He shook hands with me."
"Did he? Well, they weren't having any of it. The bull-fighter fellow was rather good. He didn't say much, but he kept getting up and getting knocked down again. Cohn couldn't knock him out. It must have been damned funny."
"Where did you hear all this?"
"Brett. I saw her this morning."
"What happened finally?"
"It seems the bull-fighter fellow was sitting on the bed. He'd been knocked down about fifteen times, and he wanted to fight some more. Brett held him and wouldn't let him get up. He was weak, but Brett couldn't hold him, and he got up. Then Cohn said he wouldn't hit him again. Said he couldn't do it. Said it would be wicked. So the bull-fighter chap sort of rather staggered over to him. Cohn went back against the wall.
"'So you won't hit me?'
"'No,' said Cohn. 'I'd be ashamed to.'
"So the bull-fighter fellow hit him just as hard as he could in the face, and then sat down on the floor. He couldn't get up, Brett said. Cohn wanted to pick him up and carry him to the bed. He said if Cohn helped him he'd kill him, and he'd kill him anyway this morning if Cohn wasn't out of town. Cohn was crying, and Brett had told him off, and he wanted to shake hands. I've told you that before."
"Tell the rest," Bill said.
"It seems the bull-fighter chap was sitting on the floor. He was waiting to get strength enough to get up and hit Cohn again. Brett wasn't having any shaking hands, and Cohn was crying and telling her how much he loved her, and she was telling him not to be a ruddy ass. Then Cohn leaned down to shake hands with the bull-fighter fellow. No hard feelings, you know. All for forgiveness. And the bull-fighter chap hit him in the face again."
"That's quite a kid," Bill said.
"He ruined Cohn," Mike said. "You know I don't think Cohn will ever want to knock people about again."
"When did you see Brett?"
"This morning. She came in to get some things. She's looking after this Romero lad."
He poured out another bottle of beer.
"Brett's rather cut up. But she loves looking after people. That's how we came to go off together. She was looking after me."
"I know," I said.
"I'm rather drunk," Mike said. "I think I'll stay rather drunk. This is all awfully amusing, but it's not too pleasant. It's not too pleasant for me."
He drank off the beer.
"I gave Brett what for, you know. I said if she would go about with Jews and bull-fighters and such people, she must expect trouble." He leaned forward. "I say, Jake, do you mind if I drink that bottle of yours? She'll bring you another one."
"Please," I said. "I wasn't drinking it, anyway."
Mike started to open the bottle.
"Would you mind opening it?" I pressed up the wire fastener and poured it for him.
"You know," Mike went on, "Brett was rather good. She's always rather good. I gave her a fearful hiding about Jews and bull-fighters, and all those sort of people, and do you know what she said: 'Yes. I've had such a hell of a happy life with the British aristocracy!'"
He took a drink.
"That was rather good. Ashley, chap she got the title from, was a sailor, you know. Ninth baronet. When he came home he wouldn't sleep in a bed. Always made Brett sleep on the floor. Finally, when he got really bad, he used to tell her he'd kill her. Always slept with a loaded service revolver. Brett used to take the shells out when he'd gone to sleep. She hasn't had an absolutely happy life. Brett. Damned shame, too. She enjoys things so."
He stood up.
His hand was shaky.
"I'm going in the room. Try and get a little sleep."
He smiled.
"We go too long without sleep in these fiestas. I'm going to start now and get plenty of sleep. Damn bad thing not to get sleep. Makes you frightfully nervy."
"We'll see you at noon at the Iruña," Bill said.
Mike went out the door.
We heard him in the next room.
He rang the bell and the chambermaid came and knocked at the door.
"Bring up half a dozen bottles of beer and a bottle of Fundador," Mike told her.
"Si, Señorito."
"I'm going to bed," Bill said. "Poor old Mike. I had a hell of a row about him last night."
"Where? At that Milano place?"
"Yes. There was a fellow there that had helped pay Brett and Mike out of Cannes, once. He was damned nasty."
"I know the story."
"I didn't. Nobody ought to have a right to say things about Mike."
"That's what makes it bad."
"They oughtn't to have any right. I wish to hell they didn't have any right. I'm going to bed."
"Was anybody killed in the ring?"
"I don't think so. Just badly hurt."
"A man was killed outside in the runway."
"Was there?" said Bill.
At noon we were all at the café.
It was crowded.
We were eating shrimps and drinking beer.
The town was crowded.
Every street was full.
Big motor-cars from Biarritz and San Sebastian kept driving up and parking around the square.
They brought people for the bull-fight.
Sight-seeing cars came up, too.
There was one with twenty-five Englishwomen in it.
They sat in the big, white car and looked through their glasses at the fiesta.
The dancers were all quite drunk.
It was the last day of the fiesta.
The fiesta was solid and unbroken, but the motor-cars and tourist-cars made little islands of onlookers.
When the cars emptied, the onlookers were absorbed into the crowd.
You did not see them again except as sport clothes, odd-looking at a table among the closely packed peasants in black smocks.
The fiesta absorbed even the Biarritz English so that you did not see them unless you passed close to a table.
All the time there was music in the street.
The drums kept on pounding and the pipes were going.
Inside the cafés men with their hands gripping the table, or on each other's shoulders, were singing the hard-voiced singing.
"Here comes Brett," Bill said.
I looked and saw her coming through the crowd in the square, walking, her head up, as though the fiesta were being staged in her honor, and she found it pleasant and amusing.
"Hello, you chaps!" she said. "I say, I have a thirst."
"Get another big beer," Bill said to the waiter.
"Shrimps?"
"Is Cohn gone?" Brett asked.
"Yes," Bill said. "He hired a car."
The beer came.
Brett started to lift the glass mug and her hand shook.
She saw it and smiled, and leaned forward and took a long sip.
"Good beer."
"Very good," I said. I was nervous about Mike. I did not think he had slept. He must have been drinking all the time, but he seemed to be under control.
"I heard Cohn had hurt you, Jake," Brett said.
"No. Knocked me out. That was all."
"I say, he did hurt Pedro Romero," Brett said. "He hurt him most badly."
"How is he?"
"He'll be all right. He won't go out of the room."
"Does he look badly?"
"Very. He was really hurt. I told him I wanted to pop out and see you chaps for a minute."
"Is he going to fight?"
"Rather. I'm going with you, if you don't mind."
"How's your boy friend?" Mike asked. He had not listened to anything that Brett had said.
"Brett's got a bull-fighter," he said. "She had a Jew named Cohn, but he turned out badly."
Brett stood up.
"I am not going to listen to that sort of rot from you, Michael."
"How's your boy friend?"
"Damned well," Brett said. "Watch him this afternoon."
"Brett's got a bull-fighter," Mike said. "A beautiful, bloody bull-fighter."
"Would you mind walking over with me? I want to talk to you, Jake."
"Tell him all about your bull-fighter," Mike said. "Oh, to hell with your bull-fighter!" He tipped the table so that all the beers and the dish of shrimps went over in a crash.
"Come on," Brett said. "Let's get out of this."
In the crowd crossing the square I said: "How is it?".
"I'm not going to see him after lunch until the fight. His people come in and dress him. They're very angry about me, he says."
Brett was radiant.
She was happy.
The sun was out and the day was bright.
"I feel altogether changed," Brett said. "You've no idea, Jake."
"Anything you want me to do?"
"No, just go to the fight with me."
"We'll see you at lunch?"
"No. I'm eating with him."
We were standing under the arcade at the door of the hotel.
They were carrying tables out and setting them up under the arcade.
"Want to take a turn out to the park?" Brett asked. "I don't want to go up yet. I fancy he's sleeping."
We walked along past the theatre and out of the square and along through the barracks of the fair, moving with the crowd between the lines of booths.
We came out on a cross-street that led to the Paseo de Sarasate.
We could see the crowd walking there, all the fashionably dressed people.
They were making the turn at the upper end of the park.
"Don't let's go there," Brett said. "I don't want staring at just now."
We stood in the sunlight.
It was hot and good after the rain and the clouds from the sea.
"I hope the wind goes down," Brett said. "It's very bad for him."
"So do I."
"He says the bulls are all right."
"They're good."
"Is that San Fermin's?"
Brett looked at the yellow wall of the chapel.
"Yes. Where the show started on Sunday."
"Let's go in. Do you mind? I'd rather like to pray a little for him or something."
We went in through the heavy leather door that moved very lightly.
It was dark inside.
Many people were praying.
You saw them as your eyes adjusted themselves to the half-light.
We knelt at one of the long wooden benches.
After a little I felt Brett stiffen beside me, and saw she was looking straight ahead.
"Come on," she whispered throatily. "Let's get out of here. Makes me damned nervous."
Outside in the hot brightness of the street Brett looked up at the tree-tops in the wind.
The praying had not been much of a success.
"Don't know why I get so nervy in church," Brett said. "Never does me any good."
We walked along.
"I'm damned bad for a religious atmosphere," Brett said. "I've the wrong type of face.
"You know," Brett said, "I'm not worried about him at all. I just feel happy about him."
"Good."
"I wish the wind would drop, though."
"It's liable to go down by five o'clock."
"Let's hope."
"You might pray," I laughed.
"Never does me any good. I've never gotten anything I prayed for. Have you?"
"Oh, yes."
"Oh, rot," said Brett. "Maybe it works for some people, though. You don't look very religious, Jake."
"I'm pretty religious."
"Oh, rot," said Brett. "Don't start proselyting to-day. To-day's going to be bad enough as it is."
It was the first time I had seen her in the old happy, careless way since before she went off with Cohn.
We were back again in front of the hotel.
All the tables were set now, and already several were filled with people eating.
"Do look after Mike," Brett said. "Don't let him get too bad."
"Your frients haff gone up-stairs," the German maître d'hôtel said in English. He was a continual eavesdropper. Brett turned to him:
"Thank you, so much. Have you anything else to say?"
"No, ma'am."
"Good," said Brett.
"Save us a table for three," I said to the German. He smiled his dirty little pink-and-white smile.
"Iss madam eating here?"
"No," Brett said.
"Den I think a tabul for two will be enuff."
"Don't talk to him," Brett said. "Mike must have been in bad shape," she said on the stairs. We passed Montoya on the stairs. He bowed and did not smile.
"I'll see you at the café," Brett said. "Thank you, so much, Jake."
We had stopped at the floor our rooms were on.
She went straight down the hall and into Romero's room.
She did not knock.
She simply opened the door, went in, and closed it behind her.
I stood in front of the door of Mike's room and knocked.
There was no answer.
I tried the knob and it opened.
Inside the room was in great disorder.
All the bags were opened and clothing was strewn around.
There were empty bottles beside the bed.
Mike lay on the bed looking like a death mask of himself.
He opened his eyes and looked at me.
"Hello, Jake," he said very slowly. "I'm getting a lit tle sleep. I've want ed a lit tle sleep for a long time."
"Let me cover you over."
"No. I'm quite warm."
"Don't go. I have n't got ten to sleep yet."
"You'll sleep, Mike. Don't worry, boy."
"Brett's got a bull-fighter," Mike said. "But her Jew has gone away."
He turned his head and looked at me.
"Damned good thing, what?"
"Yes. Now go to sleep, Mike. You ought to get some sleep."
"I'm just start ing. I'm go ing to get a lit tle sleep."
He shut his eyes.
I went out of the room and turned the door to quietly.
Bill was in my room reading the paper.
"See Mike?"
"Yes."
"Let's go and eat."
"I won't eat down-stairs with that German head waiter. He was damned snotty when I was getting Mike up-stairs."
"He was snotty to us, too."
"Let's go out and eat in the town."
We went down the stairs.
On the stairs we passed a girl coming up with a covered tray.
"There goes Brett's lunch," Bill said.
"And the kid's," I said.
Outside on the terrace under the arcade the German head waiter came up.
His red cheeks were shiny.
He was being polite.
"I haff a tabul for two for you gentlemen," he said.
"Go sit at it," Bill said. We went on out across the street.
We ate at a restaurant in a side street off the square.
They were all men eating in the restaurant.
It was full of smoke and drinking and singing.
The food was good and so was the wine.
We did not talk much.
Afterward we went to the café and watched the fiesta come to the boiling-point.
Brett came over soon after lunch.
She said she had looked in the room and that Mike was asleep.
When the fiesta boiled over and toward the bull-ring we went with the crowd.
Brett sat at the ringside between Bill and me.
Directly below us was the callejon, the passageway between the stands and the red fence of the barrera.
Behind us the concrete stands filled solidly.
Out in front, beyond the red fence, the sand of the ring was smooth-rolled and yellow.
It looked a little heavy from the rain, but it was dry in the sun and firm and smooth.
The sword-handlers and bull-ring servants came down the callejon carrying on their shoulders the wicker baskets of fighting capes and muletas.
They were bloodstained and compactly folded and packed in the baskets.
The sword-handlers opened the heavy leather sword-cases so the red wrapped hilts of the sheaf of swords showed as the leather case leaned against the fence.
They unfolded the dark-stained red flannel of the muletas and fixed batons in them to spread the stuff and give the matador something to hold.
Brett watched it all.
She was absorbed in the professional details.
"He's his name stencilled on all the capes and muletas," she said. "Why do they call them muletas?"
"I don't know."
"I wonder if they ever launder them."
"I don't think so. It might spoil the color."
"The blood must stiffen them," Bill said.
"Funny," Brett said. "How one doesn't mind the blood."
Below in the narrow passage of the callejon the sword-handlers arranged everything.
All the seats were full.
Above, all the boxes were full.
There was not an empty seat except in the President's box.
When he came in the fight would start.
Across the smooth sand, in the high doorway that led into the corrals, the bull-fighters were standing, their arms furled in their capes, talking, waiting for the signal to march in across the arena.
Brett was watching them with the glasses.
"Here, would you like to look?"
I looked through the glasses and saw the three matadors.
Romero was in the centre, Belmonte on his left, Marcial on his right.
Back of them were their people, and behind the banderilleros, back in the passageway and in the open space of the corral, I saw the picadors.
Romero was wearing a black suit.
His tricornered hat was low down over his eyes.
I could not see his face clearly under the hat, but it looked badly marked.
He was looking straight ahead.
Marcial was smoking a cigarette guardedly, holding it in his hand.
Belmonte looked ahead, his face wan and yellow, his long wolf jaw out.
He was looking at nothing.
Neither he nor Romero seemed to have anything in common with the others.
They were all alone.
The President came in; there was handclapping above us in the grand stand, and I handed the glasses to Brett.
There was applause.
The music started.
Brett looked through the glasses.
"Here, take them," she said.
Through the glasses I saw Belmonte speak to Romero.
Marcial straightened up and dropped his cigarette, and, looking straight ahead, their heads back, their free arms swinging, the three matadors walked out.
Behind them came all the procession, opening out, all striding in step, all the capes furled, everybody with free arms swinging, and behind rode the picadors, their pics rising like lances.
Behind all came the two trains of mules and the bull-ring servants.
The matadors bowed, holding their hats on, before the President's box, and then came over to the barrera below us.
Pedro Romero took off his heavy gold-brocaded cape and handed it over the fence to his sword-handler.
He said something to the sword-handler.
Close below us we saw Romero's lips were puffed, both eyes were discolored.
His face was discolored and swollen.
The sword-handler took the cape, looked up at Brett, and came over to us and handed up the cape.
"Spread it out in front of you," I said.
Brett leaned forward.
The cape was heavy and smoothly stiff with gold.
The sword-handler looked back, shook his head, and said something.
A man beside me leaned over toward Brett.
"He doesn't want you to spread it," he said. "You should fold it and keep it in your lap."
Brett folded the heavy cape.
Romero did not look up at us.
He was speaking to Belmonte.
Belmonte had sent his formal cape over to some friends.
He looked across at them and smiled, his wolf smile that was only with the mouth.
Romero leaned over the barrera and asked for the water-jug.
The sword-handler brought it and Romero poured water over the percale of his fighting-cape, and then scuffed the lower folds in the sand with his slippered foot.
"What's that for?" Brett asked.
"To give it weight in the wind."
"His face looks bad," Bill said.
"He feels very badly," Brett said. "He should be in bed."
The first bull was Belmonte's.
Belmonte was very good.
But because he got thirty thousand pesetas and people had stayed in line all night to buy tickets to see him, the crowd demanded that he should be more than very good.
Belmonte's great attraction is working close to the bull.
In bull-fighting they speak of the terrain of the bull and the terrain of the bull-fighter.
As long as a bull-fighter stays in his own terrain he is comparatively safe.
Each time he enters into the terrain of the bull he is in great danger.
Belmonte, in his best days, worked always in the terrain of the bull.
This way he gave the sensation of coming tragedy.
People went to the corrida to see Belmonte, to be given tragic sensations, and perhaps to see the death of Belmonte.
Fifteen years ago they said if you wanted to see Belmonte you should go quickly, while he was still alive.
Since then he has killed more than a thousand bulls.
When he retired the legend grew up about how his bull-fighting had been, and when he came out of retirement the public were disappointed because no real man could work as close to the bulls as Belmonte was supposed to have done, not, of course, even Belmonte.
Also Belmonte imposed conditions and insisted that his bulls should not be too large, nor too dangerously armed with horns, and so the element that was necessary to give the sensation of tragedy was not there, and the public, who wanted three times as much from Belmonte, who was sick with a fistula, as Belmonte had ever been able to give, felt defrauded and cheated, and Belmonte's jaw came further out in contempt, and his face turned yellower, and he moved with greater difficulty as his pain increased, and finally the crowd were actively against him, and he was utterly contemptuous and indifferent.
He had meant to have a great afternoon, and instead it was an afternoon of sneers, shouted insults, and finally a volley of cushions and pieces of bread and vegetables, thrown down at him in the plaza where he had had his greatest triumphs.
His jaw only went further out.
Sometimes he turned to smile that toothed, long-jawed, lipless smile when he was called something particularly insulting, and always the pain that any movement produced grew stronger and stronger, until finally his yellow face was parchment color, and after his second bull was dead and the throwing of bread and cushions was over, after he had saluted the President with the same wolf-jawed smile and contemptuous eyes, and handed his sword over the barrera to be wiped, and put back in its case, he passed through into the callejon and leaned on the barrera below us, his head on his arms, not seeing, not hearing anything, only going through his pain.
When he looked up, finally, he asked for a drink of water.
He swallowed a little, rinsed his mouth, spat the water, took his cape, and went back into the ring.
Because they were against Belmonte the public were for Romero.
From the moment he left the barrera and went toward the bull they applauded him.
Belmonte watched Romero, too, watched him always without seeming to.
He paid no attention to Marcial.
Marcial was the sort of thing he knew all about.
He had come out of retirement to compete with Marcial, knowing it was a competition gained in advance.
He had expected to compete with Marcial and the other stars of the decadence of bull-fighting, and he knew that the sincerity of his own bull-fighting would be so set off by the false æsthetics of the bull-fighters of the decadent period that he would only have to be in the ring.
His return from retirement had been spoiled by Romero.
Romero did always, smoothly, calmly, and beautifully, what he, Belmonte, could only bring himself to do now sometimes.
The crowd felt it, even the people from Biarritz, even the American ambassador saw it, finally.
It was a competition that Belmonte would not enter because it would lead only to a bad horn wound or death.
Belmonte was no longer well enough.
He no longer had his greatest moments in the bull-ring.
He was not sure that there were any great moments.
Things were not the same and now life only came in flashes.
He had flashes of the old greatness with his bulls, but they were not of value because he had discounted them in advance when he had picked the bulls out for their safety, getting out of a motor and leaning on a fence, looking over at the herd on the ranch of his friend the bull-breeder.
So he had two small, manageable bulls without much horns, and when he felt the greatness again coming, just a little of it through the pain that was always with him, it had been discounted and sold in advance, and it did not give him a good feeling.
It was the greatness, but it did not make bull-fighting wonderful to him any more.
Pedro Romero had the greatness.
He loved bull-fighting, and I think he loved the bulls, and I think he loved Brett.
Everything of which he could control the locality he did in front of her all that afternoon.
Never once did he look up.
He made it stronger that way, and did it for himself, too, as well as for her.
Because he did not look up to ask if it pleased he did it all for himself inside, and it strengthened him, and yet he did it for her, too.
But he did not do it for her at any loss to himself.
He gained by it all through the afternoon.
His first "quite" was directly below us.
The three matadors take the bull in turn after each charge he makes at a picador.
Belmonte was the first.
Marcial was the second.
Then came Romero.
The three of them were standing at the left of the horse.
The picador, his hat down over his eyes, the shaft of his pic angling sharply toward the bull, kicked in the spurs and held them and with the reins in his left hand walked the horse forward toward the bull.
The bull was watching.
Seemingly he watched the white horse, but really he watched the triangular steel point of the pic.
Romero, watching, saw the bull start to turn his head.
He did not want to charge.
Romero flicked his cape so the color caught the bull's eye.
The bull charged with the reflex, charged, and found not the flash of color but a white horse, and a man leaned far over the horse, shot the steel point of the long hickory shaft into the hump of muscle on the bull's shoulder, and pulled his horse sideways as he pivoted on the pic, making a wound, enforcing the iron into the bull's shoulder, making him bleed for Belmonte.
The bull did not insist under the iron.
He did not really want to get at the horse.
He turned and the group broke apart and Romero was taking him out with his cape.
He took him out softly and smoothly, and then stopped and, standing squarely in front of the bull, offered him the cape.
The bull's tail went up and he charged, and Romero moved his arms ahead of the bull, wheeling, his feet firmed.
The dampened, mud-weighted cape swung open and full as a sail fills, and Romero pivoted with it just ahead of the bull.
At the end of the pass they were facing each other again.
Romero smiled.
The bull wanted it again, and Romero's cape filled again, this time on the other side.
Each time he let the bull pass so close that the man and the bull and the cape that filled and pivoted ahead of the bull were all one sharply etched mass.
It was all so slow and so controlled.
It was as though he were rocking the bull to sleep.
He made four veronicas like that, and finished with a half-veronica that turned his back on the bull and came away toward the applause, his hand on his hip, his cape on his arm, and the bull watching his back going away.
In his own bulls he was perfect.
His first bull did not see well.
After the first two passes with the cape Romero knew exactly how bad the vision was impaired.
He worked accordingly.
It was not brilliant bull-fighting.
It was only perfect bull-fighting.
The crowd wanted the bull changed.
They made a great row.
Nothing very fine could happen with a bull that could not see the lures, but the President would not order him replaced.
"Why don't they change him?" Brett asked.
"They've paid for him. They don't want to lose their money."
"It's hardly fair to Romero."
"Watch how he handles a bull that can't see the color."
"It's the sort of thing I don't like to see."
It was not nice to watch if you cared anything about the person who was doing it.
With the bull who could not see the colors of the capes, or the scarlet flannel of the muleta, Romero had to make the bull consent with his body.
He had to get so close that the bull saw his body, and would start for it, and then shift the bull's charge to the flannel and finish out the pass in the classic manner.
The Biarritz crowd did not like it They thought Romero was afraid, and that was why he gave that little sidestep each time as he transferred the bull's charge from his own body to the flannel.
They preferred Belmonte's imitation of himself or Marcial's imitation of Belmonte.
There were three of them in the row behind us.
"What's he afraid of the bull for? The bull's so dumb he only goes after the cloth."
"He's just a young bull-fighter. He hasn't learned it yet."
"But I thought he was fine with the cape before."
"Probably he's nervous now."
Out in the centre of the ring, all alone, Romero was going on with the same thing, getting so close that the bull could see him plainly, offering the body, offering it again a little closer, the bull watching dully, then so close that the bull thought he had him, offering again and finally drawing the charge and then, just before the horns came, giving the bull the red cloth to follow with at little, almost imperceptible, jerk that so offended the critical judgment of the Biarritz bull-fight experts.
"He's going to kill now," I said to Brett. "The bull's still strong. He wouldn't wear himself out."
Out in the centre of the ring Romero profiled in front of the bull, drew the sword out from the folds of the muleta, rose on his toes, and sighted along the blade.
The bull charged as Romero charged.
Romero's left hand dropped the muleta over the bull's muzzle to blind him, his left shoulder went forward between the horns as the sword went in, and for just an instant he and the bull were one, Romero way out over the bull, the right arm extended high up to where the hilt of the sword had gone in between the bull's shoulders.
Then the figure was broken.
There was a little jolt as Romero came clear, and then he was standing, one hand up, facing the bull, his shirt ripped out from under his sleeve, the white blowing in the wind, and the bull, the red sword hilt tight between his shoulders, his head going down and his legs settling.
"There he goes," Bill said.
Romero was close enough so the bull could see him.
His hand still up, he spoke to the bull.
The bull gathered himself, then his head went forward and he went over slowly, then all over, suddenly, four feet in the air.
They handed the sword to Romero, and carrying it blade down, the muleta in his other hand, he walked over to in front of the President's box, bowed, straightened, and came over to the barrera and handed over the sword and muleta.
"Bad one," said the sword-handler.
"He made me sweat," said Romero. He wiped off his face. The sword-handler handed him the water-jug. Romero wiped his lips. It hurt him to drink out of the jug. He did not look up at us.
Marcial had a big day.
They were still applauding him when Romero's last bull came in.
It was the bull that had sprinted out and killed the man in the morning running.
During Romero's first bull his hurt face had been very noticeable.
Everything he did showed it.
All the concentration of the awkwardly delicate working with the bull that could not see well brought it out.
The fight with Cohn had not touched his spirit but his face had been smashed and his body hurt.
He was wiping all that out now.
Each thing that he did with this bull wiped that out a little cleaner.
It was a good bull, a big bull, and with horns, and it turned and recharged easily and surely.
He was what Romero wanted in bulls.
When he had finished his work with the muleta and was ready to kill, the crowd made him go on.
They did not want the bull killed yet, they did not want it to be over.
Romero went on.
It was like a course in bull-fighting.
All the passes he linked up, all completed, all slow, templed and smooth.
There were no tricks and no mystifications.
There was no brusqueness.
And each pass as it reached the summit gave you a sudden ache inside.
The crowd did not want it ever to be finished.
The bull was squared on all four feet to be killed, and Romero killed directly below us.
He killed not as he had been forced to by the last bull, but as he wanted to.
He profiled directly in front of the bull, drew the sword out of the folds of the muleta and sighted along the blade.
The bull watched him.
Romero spoke to the bull and tapped one of his feet.
The bull charged and Romero waited for the charge, the muleta held low, sighting along the blade, his feet firm.
Then without taking a step forward, he became one with the bull, the sword was in high between the shoulders, the bull had followed the low-swung flannel, that disappeared as Romero lurched clear to the left, and it was over.
The bull tried to go forward, his legs commenced to settle, he swung from side to side, hesitated, then went down on his knees, and Romero's older brother leaned forward behind him and drove a short knife into the bull's neck at the base of the horns.
The first time he missed.
He drove the knife in again, and the bull went over, twitching and rigid.
Romero's brother, holding the bull's horn in one hand, the knife in the other, looked up at the President's box.
Handkerchiefs were waving all over the bull-ring.
The President looked down from the box and waved his handkerchief.
The brother cut the notched black ear from the dead bull and trotted over with it to Romero.
The bull lay heavy and black on the sand, his tongue out.
Boys were running toward him from all parts of the arena, making a little circle around him.
They were starting to dance around the bull.
Romero took the ear from his brother and held it up toward the President.
The President bowed and Romero, running to get ahead of the crowd, came toward us.
He leaned up against the barrera and gave the ear to Brett.
He nodded his head and smiled.
The crowd were all about him.
Brett held down the cape.
"You liked it?" Romero called.
Brett did not say anything.
They looked at each other and smiled.
Brett had the ear in her hand.
"Don't get bloody," Romero said, and grinned. The crowd wanted him. Several boys shouted at Brett. The crowd was the boys, the dancers, and the drunks. Romero turned and tried to get through the crowd. They were all around him trying to lift him and put him on their shoulders. He fought and twisted away, and started running, in the midst of them, toward the exit. He did not want to be carried on people's shoulders. But they held him and lifted him. It was uncomfortable and his legs were spraddled and his body was very sore. They were lifting him and all running toward the gate. He had his hand on somebody's shoulder. He looked around at us apologetically. The crowd, running, went out the gate with him.
We all three went back to the hotel.
Brett went up-stairs.
Bill and I sat in the down-stairs dining-room and ate some hard-boiled eggs and drank several bottles of beer.
Belmonte came down in his street clothes with his manager and two other men.
They sat at the next table and ate.
Belmonte ate very little.
They were leaving on the seven o'clock train for Barcelona.
Belmonte wore a blue-striped shirt and a dark suit, and ate soft-boiled eggs.
The others ate a big meal.
Belmonte did not talk.
He only answered questions.
Bill was tired after the bull-fight.
So was I.
We both took a bull-fight very hard.
We sat and ate the eggs and I watched Belmonte and the people at his table.
The men with him were tough-looking and businesslike.
"Come on over to the café," Bill said. "I want an absinthe."
It was the last day of the fiesta.
Outside it was beginning to be cloudy again.
The square was full of people and the fireworks experts were making up their set pieces for the night and covering them over with beech branches.
Boys were watching.
We passed stands of rockets with long bamboo stems.
Outside the café there was a great crowd.
The music and the dancing were going on.
The giants and the dwarfs were passing.
"Where's Edna?" I asked Bill.
"I don't know."
We watched the beginning of the evening of the last night of the fiesta.
The absinthe made everything seem better.
I drank it without sugar in the dripping glass, and it was pleasantly bitter.
"I feel sorry about Cohn," Bill said. "He had an awful time."
"Oh, to hell with Cohn," I said.
"Where do you suppose he went?"
"Up to Paris."
"What do you suppose he'll do?"
"Oh, to hell with him."
"What do you suppose he'll do?"
"Pick up with his old girl, probably."
"Who was his old girl?"
"Somebody named Frances."
We had another absinthe.
"When do you go back?" I asked.
"To-morrow."
After a little while Bill said: "Well, it was a swell fiesta.
"Yes," I said; "something doing all the time."
"You wouldn't believe it. It's like a wonderful nightmare."
"Sure," I said. "I'd believe anything. Including nightmares."
"What's the matter? Feel low?"
"Low as hell."
"Have another absinthe. Here, waiter! Another absinthe for this señor."
"I feel like hell," I said.
"Drink that," said Bill. "Drink it slow."
It was beginning to get dark.
The fiesta was going on.
I began to feel drunk but I did not feel any better.
"How do you feel?"
"I feel like hell."
"Have another?"
"It won't do any good."
"Try it. You can't tell; maybe this is the one that gets it. Hey, waiter! Another absinthe for this señor!"
I poured the water directly into it and stirred it instead of letting it drip.
Bill put in a lump of ice.
I stirred the ice around with a spoon in the brownish, cloudy mixture.
"How is it?"
"Fine."
"Don't drink it fast that way. It will make you sick."
I set down the glass.
I had not meant to drink it fast.
"I feel tight."
"You ought to."
"That's what you wanted, wasn't it?"
"Sure. Get tight. Get over your damn depression."
"Well, I'm tight. Is that what you want?"
"Sit down."
"I won't sit down," I said. "I'm going over to the hotel."
I was very drunk.
I was drunker than I ever remembered having been.
At the hotel I went up-stairs.
Brett's door was open.
I put my head in the room.
Mike was sitting on the bed.
He waved a bottle.
"Jake," he said. "Come in, Jake."
I went in and sat down.
The room was unstable unless I looked at some fixed point.
"Brett, you know. She's gone off with the bull-fighter chap."
"No."
"Yes. She looked for you to say good-bye. They went on the seven o'clock train."
"Did they?"
"Bad thing to do," Mike said. "She shouldn't have done it."
"No."
"Have a drink? Wait while I ring for some beer."
"I'm drunk," I said. "I'm going in and lie down."
"Are you blind? I was blind myself."
"Yes," I said, "I'm blind."
"Well, bung-o," Mike said. "Get some sleep, old Jake."
I went out the door and into my own room and lay on the bed.
The bed went sailing off and I sat up in bed and looked at the wall to make it stop.
Outside in the square the fiesta was going on.
It did not mean anything.
Later Bill and Mike came in to get me to go down and eat with them.
I pretended to be asleep.
"He's asleep. Better let him alone."
"He's blind as a tick," Mike said. They went out.
I got up and went to the balcony and looked out at the dancing in the square.
The world was not wheeling any more.
It was just very clear and bright, and inclined to blur at the edges.
I washed, brushed my hair.
I looked strange to myself in the glass, and went down-stairs to the dining-room.
"Here he is!" said Bill. "Good old Jake! I knew you wouldn't pass out."
"Hello, you old drunk," Mike said.
"I got hungry and woke up."
"Eat some soup," Bill said.
The three of us sat at the table, and it seemed as though about six people were missing.
BOOK III.
In the morning it was all over.
The fiesta was finished.
I woke about nine o'clock, had a bath, dressed, and went down-stairs.
The square was empty and there were no people on the streets.
A few children were picking up rocket-sticks in the square.
The cafés were just opening and the waiters were carrying out the comfortable white wicker chairs and arranging them around the marble-topped tables in the shade of the arcade.
They were sweeping the streets and sprinkling them with a hose.
I sat in one of the wicker chairs and leaned back comfortably.
The waiter was in no hurry to come.
The white-paper announcements of the unloading of the bulls and the big schedules of special trains were still up on the pillars of the arcade.
A waiter wearing a blue apron came out with a bucket of water and a cloth, and commenced to tear down the notices, pulling the paper off in strips and washing and rubbing away the paper that stuck to the stone.
The fiesta was over.
I drank a coffee and after a while Bill came over.
I watched him come walking across the square.
He sat down at the table and ordered a coffee.
"Well," he said, "it's all over."
"Yes," I said. "When do you go?"
"I don't know. We better get a car, I think. Aren't you going back to Paris?"
"No. I can stay away another week. I think I'll go to San Sebastian."
"I want to get back."
"What's Mike going to do?"
"He's going to Saint Jean de Luz."
"Let's get a car and all go as far as Bayonne. You can get the train up from there to-night."
"Good. Let's go after lunch."
"All right. I'll get the car."
We had lunch and paid the bill.
Montoya did not come near us.
One of the maids brought the bill.
The car was outside.
The chauffeur piled and strapped the bags on top of the car and put them in beside him in the front seat and we got in.
The car went out of the square, along through the side streets, out under the trees and down the hill and away from Pamplona.
It did not seem like a very long ride.
Mike had a bottle of Fundador.
I only took a couple of drinks.
We came over the mountains and out of Spain and down the white roads and through the overfoliaged, wet, green, Basque country, and finally into Bayonne.
We left Bill's baggage at the station, and he bought a ticket to Paris.
His train left at seven-ten.
We came out of the station.
The car was standing out in front.
"What shall we do about the car?" Bill asked.
"Oh, bother the car," Mike said. "Let's just keep the car with us."
"All right," Bill said. "Where shall we go?"
"Let's go to Biarritz and have a drink."
"Old Mike the spender," Bill said.
We drove in to Biarritz and left the car outside a very Ritz place.
We went into the bar and sat on high stools and drank a whiskey and soda.
"That drink's mine," Mike said.
"Let's roll for it."
So we rolled poker dice out of a deep leather dice-cup.
Bill was out first roll.
Mike lost to me and handed the bartender a hundred-franc note.
The whiskeys were twelve francs apiece.
We had another round and Mike lost again.
Each time he gave the bartender a good tip.
In a room off the bar there was a good jazz band playing.
It was a pleasant bar.
We had another round.
I went out on the first roll with four kings.
Bill and Mike rolled.
Mike won the first roll with four jacks.
Bill won the second.
On the final roll Mike had three kings and let them stay.
He handed the dice-cup to Bill.
Bill rattled them and rolled, and there were three kings, an ace, and a queen.
"It's yours, Mike," Bill said. "Old Mike, the gambler."
"I'm so sorry," Mike said. "I can't get it."
"What's the matter?"
"I've no money," Mike said. "I'm stony. I've just twenty francs. Here, take twenty francs."
Bill's face sort of changed.
"I just had enough to pay Montoya. Damned lucky to have it, too."
"I'll cash you a check," Bill said.
"That's damned nice of you, but you see I can't write checks."
"What are you going to do for money?"
"Oh, some will come through. I've two weeks allowance should be here. I can live on tick at this pub in Saint Jean."
"What do you want to do about the car?" Bill asked me. "Do you want to keep it on?"
"It doesn't make any difference. Seems sort of idiotic."
"Come on, let's have another drink," Mike said.
"Fine. This one is on me," Bill said. "Has Brett any money?" He turned to Mike.
"I shouldn't think so. She put up most of what I gave to old Montoya."
"She hasn't any money with her?" I asked.
"I shouldn't think so. She never has any money. She gets five hundred quid a year and pays three hundred and fifty of it in interest to Jews."
"I suppose they get it at the source," said Bill.
"Quite. They're not really Jews. We just call them Jews. They're Scotsmen, I believe."
"Hasn't she any at all with her?" I asked.
"I hardly think so. She gave it all to me when she left."
"Well," Bill said, "we might as well have another drink."
"Damned good idea," Mike said. "One never gets anywhere by discussing finances."
"No," said Bill. Bill and I rolled for the next two rounds. Bill lost and paid. We went out to the car.
"Anywhere you'd like to go, Mike?" Bill asked.
"Let's take a drive. It might do my credit good. Let's drive about a little."
"Fine. I'd like to see the coast. Let's drive down toward Hendaye."
"I haven't any credit along the coast."
"You can't ever tell," said Bill.
We drove out along the coast road.
There was the green of the headlands, the white, red-roofed villas, patches of forest, and the ocean very blue with the tide out and the water curling far out along the beach.
We drove through Saint Jean de Luz and passed through villages farther down the coast.
Back of the rolling country we were going through we saw the mountains we had come over from Pamplona.
The road went on ahead.
Bill looked at his watch.
It was time for us to go back.
He knocked on the glass and told the driver to turn around.
The driver backed the car out into the grass to turn it.
In back of us were the woods, below a stretch of meadow, then the sea.
At the hotel where Mike was going to stay in Saint Jean we stopped the car and he got out.
The chauffeur carried in his bags.
Mike stood by the side of the car.
"Good-bye, you chaps," Mike said. "It was a damned fine fiesta."
"So long, Mike," Bill said.
"I'll see you around," I said.
"Don't worry about money," Mike said. "You can pay for the car, Jake, and I'll send you my share."
"So long, Mike."
"So long, you chaps. You've been damned nice."
We all shook hands.
We waved from the car to Mike.
He stood in the road watching.
We got to Bayonne just before the train left.
A porter carried Bill's bags in from the consigne.
I went as far as the inner gate to the tracks.
"So long, fella," Bill said.
"So long, kid!"
"It was swell. I've had a swell time."
"Will you be in Paris?"
"No, I have to sail on the 17th. So long, fella!"
"So long, old kid!"
He went in through the gate to the train.
The porter went ahead with the bags.
I watched the train pull out.
Bill was at one of the windows.
The window passed, the rest of the train passed, and the tracks were empty.
I went outside to the car.
"How much do we owe you?" I asked the driver. The price to Bayonne had been fixed at a hundred and fifty pesetas.
"Two hundred pesetas."
"How much more will it be if you drive me to San Sebastian on your way back?"
"Fifty pesetas."
"Don't kid me."
"Thirty-five pesetas."
"It's not worth it," I said. "Drive me to the Hotel Panier Fleuri."
At the hotel I paid the driver and gave him a tip.
The car was powdered with dust.
I rubbed the rod-case through the dust.
It seemed the last thing that connected me with Spain and the fiesta.
The driver put the car in gear and went down the street.
I watched it turn off to take the road to Spain.
I went into the hotel and they gave me a room.
It was the same room I had slept in when Bill and Cohn and I were in Bayonne.
That seemed a very long time ago.
I washed, changed my shirt, and went out in the town.
At a newspaper kiosque I bought a copy of the New York Herald and sat in a café to read it.
It felt strange to be in France again.
There was a safe, suburban feeling.
I wished I had gone up to Paris with Bill, except that Paris would have meant more fiesta-ing.
I was through with fiestas for a while.
It would be quiet in San Sebastian.
The season does not open there until August.
I could get a good hotel room and read and swim.
There was a fine beach there.
There were wonderful trees along the promenade above the beach, and there were many children sent down with their nurses before the season opened.
In the evening there would be band concerts under the trees across from the Café Marinas.
I could sit in the Marinas and listen.
"How does one eat inside?" I asked the waiter. Inside the café was a restaurant.
"Well. Very well. One eats very well."
"Good."
I went in and ate dinner.
It was a big meal for France but it seemed very carefully apportioned after Spain.
I drank a bottle of wine for company.
It was a Château Margaux.
It was pleasant to be drinking slowly and to be tasting the wine and to be drinking alone.
A bottle of wine was good company.
Afterward I had coffee.
The waiter recommended a Basque liqueur called Izzarra.
He brought in the bottle and poured a liqueur-glass full.
He said Izzarra was made of the flowers of the Pyrenees.
The veritable flowers of the Pyrenees.
It looked like hair-oil and smelled like Italian strega.
I told him to take the flowers of the Pyrenees away and bring me a vieux marc.
The marc was good.
I had a second marc after the coffee.
The waiter seemed a little offended about the flowers of the Pyrenees, so I overtipped him.
That made him happy.
It felt comfortable to be in a country where it is so simple to make people happy.
You can never tell whether a Spanish waiter will thank you.
Everything is on such a clear financial basis in France.
It is the simplest country to live in.
No one makes things complicated by becoming your friend for any obscure reason.
If you want people to like you you have only to spend a little money.
I spent a little money and the waiter liked me.
He appreciated my valuable qualities.
He would be glad to see me back.
I would dine there again some time and he would be glad to see me, and would want me at his table.
It would be a sincere liking because it would have a sound basis.
I was back in France.
Next morning I tipped every one a little too much at the hotel to make more friends, and left on the morning train for San Sebastian.
At the station I did not tip the porter more than I should because I did not think I would ever see him again.
I only wanted a few good French friends in Bayonne to make me welcome in case I should come back there again.
I knew that if they remembered me their friendship would be loyal.
At Irun we had to change trains and show passports.
I hated to leave France.
Life was so simple in France.
I felt I was a fool to be going back into Spain.
In Spain you could not tell about anything.
I felt like a fool to be going back into it, but I stood in line with my passport, opened my bags for the customs, bought a ticket, went through a gate, climbed onto the train, and after forty minutes and eight tunnels I was at San Sebastian.
Even on a hot day San Sebastian has a certain early-morning quality.
The trees seem as though their leaves were never quite dry.
The streets feel as though they had just been sprinkled.
It is always cool and shady on certain streets on the hottest day.
I went to a hotel in the town where I had stopped before, and they gave me a room with a balcony that opened out above the roofs of the town.
There was a green mountainside beyond the roofs.
I unpacked my bags and stacked my books on the table beside the head of the bed, put out my shaving things, hung up some clothes in the big armoire, and made up a bundle for the laundry.
Then I took a shower in the bathroom and went down to lunch.
Spain had not changed to summer-time, so I was early.
I set my watch again.
I had recovered an hour by coming to San Sebastian.
As I went into the dining-room the concierge brought me a police bulletin to fill out.
I signed it and asked him for two telegraph forms, and wrote a message to the Hotel Montoya, telling them to forward all mail and telegrams for me to this address.
I calculated how many days I would be in San Sebastian and then wrote out a wire to the office asking them to hold mail, but forward all wires for me to San Sebastian for six days.
Then I went in and had lunch.
After lunch I went up to my room, read a while, and went to sleep.
When I woke it was half past four.
I found my swimming-suit, wrapped it with a comb in a towel, and went down-stairs and walked up the street to the Concha.
The tide was about half-way out.
The beach was smooth and firm, and the sand yellow.
I went into a bathing-cabin, undressed, put on my suit, and walked across the smooth sand to the sea.
The sand was warm under bare feet.
There were quite a few people in the water and on the beach.
Out beyond where the headlands of the Concha almost met to form the harbor there was a white line of breakers and the open sea.
Although the tide was going out, there were a few slow rollers.
They came in like undulations in the water, gathered weight of water, and then broke smoothly on the warm sand.
I waded out.
The water was cold.
As a roller came I dove, swam out under water, and came to the surface with all the chill gone.
I swam out to the raft, pulled myself up, and lay on the hot planks.
A boy and girl were at the other end.
The girl had undone the top strap of her bathing-suit and was browning her back.
The boy lay face downward on the raft and talked to her.
She laughed at things he said, and turned her brown back in the sun.
I lay on the raft in the sun until I was dry.
Then I tried several dives.
I dove deep once, swimming down to the bottom.
I swam with my eyes open and it was green and dark.
The raft made a dark shadow.
I came out of water beside the raft, pulled up, dove once more, holding it for length, and then swam ashore.
I lay on the beach until I was dry, then went into the bathing-cabin, took off my suit, sloshed myself with fresh water, and rubbed dry.
I walked around the harbor under the trees to the casino, and then up one of the cool streets to the Café Marinas.
There was an orchestra playing inside the café and I sat out on the terrace and enjoyed the fresh coolness in the hot day, and had a glass of lemon-juice and shaved ice and then a long whiskey and soda.
I sat in front of the Marinas for a long time and read and watched the people, and listened to the music.
Later when it began to get dark, I walked around the harbor and out along the promenade, and finally back to the hotel for supper.
There was a bicycle-race on, the Tour du Pays Basque, and the riders were stopping that night in San Sebastian.
In the dining-room, at one side, there was a long table of bicycle-riders, eating with their trainers and managers.
They were all French and Belgians, and paid close attention to their meal, but they were having a good time.
At the head of the table were two good-looking French girls, with much Rue du Faubourg Montmartre chic.
I could not make out whom they belonged to.
They all spoke in slang at the long table and there were many private jokes and some jokes at the far end that were not repeated when the girls asked to hear them.
The next morning at five o'clock the race resumed with the last lap, San Sebastian-Bilbao.
The bicycle-riders drank much wine, and were burned and browned by the sun.
They did not take the race seriously except among themselves.
They had raced among themselves so often that it did not make much difference who won.
Especially in a foreign country.
The money could be arranged.
The man who had a matter of two minutes lead in the race had an attack of boils, which were very painful.
He sat on the small of his back.
His neck was very red and the blond hairs were sunburned.
The other riders joked him about his boils.
He tapped on the table with his fork.
"Listen," he said, "to-morrow my nose is so tight on the handle-bars that the only thing touches those boils is a lovely breeze."
One of the girls looked at him down the table, and he grinned and turned red.
The Spaniards, they said, did not know how to pedal.
I had coffee out on the terrasse with the team manager of one of the big bicycle manufacturers.
He said it had been a very pleasant race, and would have been worth watching if Bottechia had not abandoned it at Pamplona.
The dust had been bad, but in Spain the roads were better than in France.
Bicycle road-racing was the only sport in the world, he said.
Had I ever followed the Tour de France? Only in the papers.
The Tour de France was the greatest sporting event in the world.
Following and organizing the road races had made him know France.
Few people know France.
All spring and all summer and all fall he spent on the road with bicycle road-racers.
Look at the number of motor-cars now that followed the riders from town to town in a road race.
It was a rich country and more sportif every year.
It would be the most sportif country in the world.
It was bicycle road-racing did it.
That and football.
He knew France.
La France Sportive.
He knew road-racing.
We had a cognac.
After all, though, it wasn't bad to get back to Paris.
There is only one Paname.
In all the world, that is.
Paris is the town the most sportif in the world.
Did I know the Chope de Negre? Did I not.
I would see him there some time.
I certainly would.
We would drink another fine together.
We certainly would.
They started at six o'clock less a quarter in the morning.
Would I be up for the depart? I would certainly try to.
Would I like him to call me? It was very interesting.
I would leave a call at the desk.
He would not mind calling me.
I could not let him take the trouble.
I would leave a call at the desk.
We said good-bye until the next morning.
In the morning when I awoke the bicycle-riders and their following cars had been on the road for three hours.
I had coffee and the papers in bed and then dressed and took my bathing-suit down to the beach.
Everything was fresh and cool and damp in the early morning.
Nurses in uniform and in peasant costume walked under the trees with children.
The Spanish children were beautiful.
Some bootblacks sat together under a tree talking to a soldier.
The soldier had only one arm.
The tide was in and there was a good breeze and a surf on the beach.
I undressed in one of the bath-cabins, crossed the narrow line of beach and went into the water.
I swam out, trying to swim through the rollers, but having to dive sometimes.
Then in the quiet water I turned and floated.
Floating I saw only the sky, and felt the drop and lift of the swells.
I swam back to the surf and coasted in, face down, on a big roller, then turned and swam, trying to keep in the trough and not have a wave break over me.
It made me tired, swimming in the trough, and I turned and swam out to the raft.
The water was buoyant and cold.
It felt as though you could never sink.
I swam slowly, it seemed like a long swim with the high tide, and then pulled up on the raft and sat, dripping, on the boards that were becoming hot in the sun.
I looked around at the bay, the old town, the casino, the line of trees along the promenade, and the big hotels with their white porches and gold-lettered names.
Off on the right, almost closing the harbor, was a green hill with a castle.
The raft rocked with the motion of the water.
On the other side of the narrow gap that led into the open sea was another high headland.
I thought I would like to swim across the bay but I was afraid of cramp.
I sat in the sun and watched the bathers on the beach.
They looked very small.
After a while I stood up, gripped with my toes on the edge of the raft as it tipped with my weight, and dove cleanly and deeply, to come up through the lightening water, blew the salt water out of my head, and swam slowly and steadily in to shore.
After I was dressed and had paid for the bath-cabin, I walked back to the hotel.
The bicycle-racers had left several copies of L'Auto around, and I gathered them up in the reading-room and took them out and sat in an easy chair in the sun to read about and catch up on French sporting life.
While I was sitting there the concierge came out with a blue envelope in his hand.
"A telegram for you, sir."
I poked my finger along under the fold that was fastened down, spread it open, and read it.
It had been forwarded from Paris:.
COULD YOU COME HOTEL MONTANA MADRID.
AM RATHER IN TROUBLE BRETT.
I tipped the concierge and read the message again.
A postman was coming along the sidewalk.
He turned in the hotel.
He had a big moustache and looked very military.
He came out of the hotel again.
The concierge was just behind him.
"Here's another telegram for you, sir."
"Thank you," I said.
I opened it.
It was forwarded from Pamplona.
COULD YOU COME HOTEL MONTANA MADRID.
AM RATHER IN TROUBLE BRETT.
The concierge stood there waiting for another tip, probably.
"What time is there a train for Madrid?"
"It left at nine this morning. There is a slow train at eleven, and the Sud Express at ten to-night."
"Get me a berth on the Sud Express. Do you want the money now?"
"Just as you wish," he said. "I will have it put on the bill."
"Do that."
Well, that meant San Sebastian all shot to hell.
I suppose, vaguely, I had expected something of the sort.
I saw the concierge standing in the doorway.
"Bring me a telegram form, please."
He brought it and I took out my fountain-pen and printed:.
LADY ASHLEY HOTEL MONTANA MADRID.
ARRIVING SUD EXPRESS TOMORROW LOVE.
JAKE.
That seemed to handle it.
That was it.
Send a girl off with one man.
Introduce her to another to go off with him.
Now go and bring her back.
And sign the wire with love.
That was it all right.
I went in to lunch.
I did not sleep much that night on the Sud Express.
In the morning I had breakfast in the dining-car and watched the rock and pine country between Avila and Escorial.
I saw the Escorial out of the window, gray and long and cold in the sun, and did not give a damn about it.
I saw Madrid come up over the plain, a compact white sky-line on the top of a little cliff away off across the sun-hardened country.
The Norte station in Madrid is the end of the line.
All trains finish there.
They don't go on anywhere.
Outside were cabs and taxis and a line of hotel runners.
It was like a country town.
I took a taxi and we climbed up through the gardens, by the empty palace and the unfinished church on the edge of the cliff, and on up until we were in the high, hot, modern town.
The taxi coasted down a smooth street to the Puerta del Sol, and then through the traffic and out into the Carrera San Jeronimo.
All the shops had their awnings down against the heat.
The windows on the sunny side of the street were shuttered.
The taxi stopped at the curb.
I saw the sign HOTEL MONTANA on the second floor.
The taxi-driver carried the bags in and left them by the elevator.
I could not make the elevator work, so I walked up.
On the second floor up was a cut brass sign: HOTEL MONTANA.
I rang and no one came to the door.
I rang again and a maid with a sullen face opened the door.
"Is Lady Ashley here?" I asked.
She looked at me dully.
"Is an Englishwoman here?"
She turned and called some one inside.
A very fat woman came to the door.
Her hair was gray and stiffly oiled in scallops around her face.
She was short and commanding.
"Muy buenos," I said. "Is there an Englishwoman here? I would like to see this English lady."
"Muy buenos. Yes, there is a female English. Certainly you can see her if she wishes to see you."
"She wishes to see me."
"The chica will ask her."
"It is very hot."
"It is very hot in the summer in Madrid."
"And how cold in winter."
"Yes, it is very cold in winter."
Did I want to stay myself in person in the Hotel Montana?.
Of that as yet I was undecided, but it would give me pleasure if my bags were brought up from the ground floor in order that they might not be stolen.
Nothing was ever stolen in the Hotel Montana.
In other fondas, yes.
Not here.
The personages of this establishment were rigidly selectioned.
I was happy to hear it.
Nevertheless I would welcome the upbringal of my bags.
The maid came in and said that the female English wanted to see the male English now, at once.
"Good," I said. "You see. It is as I said."
"Clearly."
I followed the maid's back down a long, dark corridor.
At the end she knocked on a door.
"Hello," said Brett. "Is it you, Jake?"
"It's me."
"Come in. Come in."
I opened the door.
The maid closed it after me.
Brett was in bed.
She had just been brushing her hair and held the brush in her hand.
The room was in that disorder produced only by those who have always had servants.
"Darling!" Brett said.
I went over to the bed and put my arms around her.
She kissed me, and while she kissed me I could feel she was thinking of something else.
She was trembling in my arms.
She felt very small.
"Darling! I've had such a hell of a time."
"Tell me about it."
"Nothing to tell. He only left yesterday. I made him go."
"Why didn't you keep him?"
"I don't know. It isn't the sort of thing one does. I don't think I hurt him any."
"You were probably damn good for him."
"He shouldn't be living with any one. I realized that right away."
"No."
"Oh, hell!" she said, "let's not talk about it. Let's never talk about it."
"All right."
"It was rather a knock his being ashamed of me. He was ashamed of me for a while, you know."
"No."
"Oh, yes. They ragged him about me at the café, I guess. He wanted me to grow my hair out. Me, with long hair. I'd look so like hell."
"It's funny."
"He said it would make me more womanly. I'd look a fright."
"What happened?"
"Oh, he got over that. He wasn't ashamed of me long."
"What was it about being in trouble?"
"I didn't know whether I could make him go, and I didn't have a sou to go away and leave him. He tried to give me a lot of money, you know. I told him I had scads of it. He knew that was a lie. I couldn't take his money, you know."
"No."
"Oh, let's not talk about it. There were some funny things, though. Do give me a cigarette."
I lit the cigarette.
"He learned his English as a waiter in Gib."
"Yes."
"He wanted to marry me, finally."
"Really?"
"Of course. I can't even marry Mike."
"Maybe he thought that would make him Lord Ashley."
"No. It wasn't that. He really wanted to marry me. So I couldn't go away from him, he said. He wanted to make it sure I could never go away from him. After I'd gotten more womanly, of course."
"You ought to feel set up."
"I do. I'm all right again. He's wiped out that damned Cohn."
"Good."
"You know I'd have lived with him if I hadn't seen it was bad for him. We got along damned well."
"Outside of your personal appearance."
"Oh, he'd have gotten used to that."
She put out the cigarette.
"I'm thirty-four, you know. I'm not going to be one of these bitches that ruins children."
"No."
"I'm not going to be that way. I feel rather good, you know. I feel rather set up."
"Good."
She looked away.
I thought she was looking for another cigarette.
Then I saw she was crying.
I could feel her crying.
Shaking and crying.
She wouldn't look up.
I put my arms around her.
"Don't let's ever talk about it. Please don't let's ever talk about it."
"Dear Brett."
"I'm going back to Mike." I could feel her crying as I held her close. "He's so damned nice and he's so awful. He's my sort of thing."
She would not look up.
I stroked her hair.
I could feel her shaking.
"I won't be one of those bitches," she said. "But, oh, Jake, please let's never talk about it."
We left the Hotel Montana.
The woman who ran the hotel would not let me pay the bill.
The bill had been paid.
"Oh, well. Let it go," Brett said. "It doesn't matter now."
We rode in a taxi down to the Palace Hotel, left the bags, arranged for berths on the Sud Express for the night, and went into the bar of the hotel for a cocktail.
We sat on high stools at the bar while the barman shook the Martinis in a large nickelled shaker.
"It's funny what a wonderful gentility you get in the bar of a big hotel," I said.
"Barmen and jockeys are the only people who are polite any more."
"No matter how vulgar a hotel is, the bar is always nice."
"It's odd."
"Bartenders have always been fine."
"You know," Brett said, "it's quite true. He is only nineteen. Isn't it amazing?"
We touched the two glasses as they stood side by side on the bar.
They were coldly beaded.
Outside the curtained window was the summer heat of Madrid.
"I like an olive in a Martini," I said to the barman.
"Right you are, sir. There you are."
"Thanks."
"I should have asked, you know."
The barman went far enough up the bar so that he would not hear our conversation.
Brett had sipped from the Martini as it stood, on the wood.
Then she picked it up.
Her hand was steady enough to lift it after that first sip.
"It's good. Isn't it a nice bar?"
"They're all nice bars."
"You know I didn't believe it at first. He was born in 1905. I was in school in Paris, then. Think of that."
"Anything you want me to think about it?"
"Don't be an ass. Would you buy a lady a drink?"
"We'll have two more Martinis."
"As they were before, sir?"
"They were very good." Brett smiled at him.
"Thank you, ma'am."
"Well, bung-o," Brett said.
"Bung-o!"
"You know," Brett said, "he'd only been with two women before. He never cared about anything but bull-fighting."
"He's got plenty of time."
"I don't know. He thinks it was me. Not the show in general."
"Well, it was you."
"Yes. It was me."
"I thought you weren't going to ever talk about it."
"How can I help it?"
"You'll lose it if you talk about it."
"I just talk around it. You know I feel rather damned good, Jake."
"You should."
"You know it makes one feel rather good deciding not to be a bitch."
"Yes."
"It's sort of what we have instead of God."
"Some people have God," I said. "Quite a lot."
"He never worked very well with me."
"Should we have another Martini?"
The barman shook up two more Martinis and poured them out into fresh glasses.
"Where will we have lunch?" I asked Brett. The bar was cool. You could feel the heat outside through the window.
"Here?" asked Brett.
"It's rotten here in the hotel. Do you know a place called Botin's?" I asked the barman.
"Yes, sir. Would you like to have me write out the address?"
"Thank you."
We lunched up-stairs at Botin's.
It is one of the best restaurants in the world.
We had roast young suckling pig and drank rioja alta.
Brett did not eat much.
She never ate much.
I ate a very big meal and drank three bottles of rioja alta.
"How do you feel, Jake?" Brett asked. "My God! what a meal you've eaten."
"I feel fine. Do you want a dessert?"
"Lord, no."
Brett was smoking.
"You like to eat, don't you?" she said.
"Yes." I said. "I like to do a lot of things."
"What do you like to do?"
"Oh," I said, "I like to do a lot of things. Don't you want a dessert?"
"You asked me that once," Brett said.
"Yes," I said. "So I did. Let's have another bottle of rioja alta."
"It's very good."
"You haven't drunk much of it," I said.
"I have. You haven't seen."
"Let's get two bottles," I said. The bottles came. I poured a little in my glass, then a glass for Brett, then filled my glass. We touched glasses.
"Bung-o!" Brett said. I drank my glass and poured out another. Brett put her hand on my arm.
"Don't get drunk, Jake," she said. "You don't have to."
"How do you know?"
"Don't," she said. "You'll be all right."
"I'm not getting drunk," I said. "I'm just drinking a little wine. I like to drink wine."
"Don't get drunk," she said. "Jake, don't get drunk."
"Want to go for a ride?" I said. "Want to ride through the town?"
"Right," Brett said. "I haven't seen Madrid. I should see Madrid."
"I'll finish this," I said.
Down-stairs we came out through the first-floor dining-room to the street.
A waiter went for a taxi.
It was hot and bright.
Up the street was a little square with trees and grass where there were taxis parked.
A taxi came up the street, the waiter hanging out at the side.
I tipped him and told the driver where to drive, and got in beside Brett.
The driver started up the street.
I settled back.
Brett moved close to me.
We sat close against each other.
I put my arm around her and she rested against me comfortably.
It was very hot and bright, and the houses looked sharply white.
We turned out onto the Gran Via.
"Oh, Jake," Brett said, "we could have had such a damned good time together."
Ahead was a mounted policeman in khaki directing traffic.
He raised his baton.
The car slowed suddenly pressing Brett against me.
"Yes," I said. "Isn't it pretty to think so?"
The Undefeated.
Manuel Garcia climbed the stairs to Don Miguel Retana's office.
He set down his suitcase and knocked on the door.
There was no answer.
Manuel, standing in the hallway, felt there was some one in the room.
He felt it through the door.
"Retana," he said, listening.
There was no answer.
He's there, all right, Manuel thought.
"Retana," he said and banged the door.
"Who's there?" said some one in the office.
"Me, Manolo," Manuel said.
"What do you want?" asked the voice.
"I want to work," Manuel said.
Something in the door clicked several times and it swung open.
Manuel went in, carrying his suitcase.
A little man sat behind a desk at the far side of the room.
Over his head was a bull's head, stuffed by a Madrid taxidermist; on the walls were framed photographs and bull-fight posters.
The little man sat looking at Manuel.
"I thought they'd killed you," he said.
Manuel knocked with his knuckles on the desk.
The little man sat looking at him across the desk.
"How many corridas you had this year?" Retana asked.
"One," he answered.
"Just that one?" the little man asked.
"That's all."
"I read about it in the papers," Retana said. He leaned back in the chair and looked at Manuel.
Manuel looked up at the stuffed bull.
He had seen it often before.
He felt a certain family interest in it.
It had killed his brother, the promising one, about nine years ago.
Manuel remembered the day.
There was a brass plate on the oak shield the bull's head was mounted on.
Manuel could not read it, but he imagined it was in memory of his brother.
Well, he had been a good kid.
The plate said: "The Bull 'Mariposa' of the Duke of Veragua, which accepted 9 varas for 7 caballos, and caused the death of Antonio Garcia, Novillero, April 27, 1909.
Retana saw him looking at the stuffed bull's head.
"The lot the Duke sent me for Sunday will make a scandal," he said. "They're all bad in the legs. What do they say about them at the Café?"
"I don't know," Manuel said. "I just got in."
"Yes," Retana said. "You still have your bag."
He looked at Manuel, leaning back behind the big desk.
"Sit down," he said. "Take off your cap."
Manuel sat down; his cap off, his face was changed.
He looked pale, and his coleta pinned forward on his head, so that it would not show under the cap, gave him a strange look.
"You don't look well," Retana said.
"I just got out of the hospital," Manuel said.
"I heard they'd cut your leg off," Retana said.
"No," said Manuel. "It got all right."
Retana leaned forward across the desk and pushed a wooden box of cigarettes toward Manuel.
"Have a cigarette," he said.
"Thanks."
Manuel lit it.
"Smoke?" he said, offering the match to Retana.
"No," Retana waved his hand, "I never smoke."
Retana watched him smoking.
"Why don't you get a job and go to work?" he said.
"I don't want to work," Manuel said. "I am a bull-fighter."
"There aren't any bull-fighters any more," Retana said.
"I'm a bull-fighter," Manuel said.
"Yes, while you're in there," Retana said.
Manuel laughed.
Retana sat, saying nothing and looking at Manuel.
"I'll put you in a nocturnal if you want," Retana offered.
"When?" Manuel asked.
"To-morrow night."
"I don't like to substitute for anybody," Manuel said. That was the way they all got killed. That was the way Salvador got killed. He tapped with his knuckles on the table.
"It's all I've got," Retana said.
"Why don't you put me on next week?" Manuel suggested.
"You wouldn't draw," Retana said. "All they want is Litri and Rubito and La Torre. Those kids are good."
"They'd come to see me get it," Manuel said, hopefully.
"No, they wouldn't. They don't know who you are any more."
"I've got a lot of stuff," Manuel said.
"I'm offering to put you on to-morrow night," Retana said. "You can work with young Hernandez and kill two novillos after the Chariots."
"Whose novillos?" Manuel asked.
"I don't know. Whatever stuff they've got in the corrals. What the veterinaries won't pass in the daytime."
"I don't like to substitute," Manuel said.
"You can take it or leave it," Retana said. He leaned forward over the papers. He was no longer interested. The appeal that Manuel had made to him for a moment when he thought of the old days was gone. He would like to get him to substitute for Larita because he could get him cheaply. He could get others cheaply too. He would like to help him though. Still he had given him the chance. It was up to him.
"How much do I get?" Manuel asked. He was still playing with the idea of refusing. But he knew he could not refuse.
"Two hundred and fifty pesetas," Retana said. He had thought of five hundred, but when he opened his mouth it said two hundred and fifty.
"You pay Villalta seven thousand," Manuel said.
"You're not Villalta," Retana said.
"I know it," Manuel said.
"He draws it, Manolo," Retana said in explanation.
"Sure," said Manuel. He stood up. "Give me three hundred, Retana."
"All right," Retana agreed. He reached in the drawer for a paper.
"Can I have fifty now?" Manuel asked.
"Sure," said Retana. He took a fifty peseta note out of his pocket-book and laid it, spread out flat, on the table.
Manuel picked it up and put it in his pocket.
"What about a cuadrilla?" he asked.
"There's the boys that always work for me nights," Retana said. "They're all right."
"How about picadors?" Manuel asked.
"They're not much," Retana admitted.
"I've got to have one good pic," Manuel said.
"Get him then," Retana said. "Go and get him."
"Not out of this," Manuel said. "I'm not paying for any cuadrilla out of sixty duros."
Retana said nothing but looked at Manuel across the big desk.
"You know I've got to have one good pic," Manuel said.
Retana said nothing but looked at Manuel from a long way off.
"It isn't right," Manuel said.
Retana was still considering him, leaning back in his chair, considering him from a long way away.
"There're the regular pics," he offered.
"I know," Manuel said. "I know your regular pics."
Retana did not smile.
Manuel knew it was over.
"All I want is an even break," Manuel said reasoningly. "When I go out there I want to be able to call my shots on the bull. It only takes one good picador."
He was talking to a man who was no longer listening.
"If you want something extra," Retana said, "go and get it. There will be a regular cuadrilla out there. Bring as many of your own pics as you want. The charlotada is over by 10.30."
"All right," Manuel said. "If that's the way you feel about it."
"That's the way," Retana said.
"I'll see you to-morrow night," Manuel said.
"I'll be out there," Retana said.
Manuel picked up his suitcase and went out.
"Shut the door," Retana called.
Manuel looked back.
Retana was sitting forward looking at some papers.
Manuel pulled the door tight until it clicked.
He went down the stairs and out of the door into the hot brightness of the street.
It was very hot in the street and the light on the white buildings was sudden and hard on his eyes.
He walked down the shady side of the steep street toward the Puerta del Sol.
The shade felt solid and cool as running water.
The heat came suddenly as he crossed the intersecting streets.
Manuel saw no one he knew in all the people he passed.
Just before the Puerta del Sol he turned into a café.
It was quiet in the café.
There were a few men sitting at tables against the wall.
At one table four men played cards.
Most of the men sat against the wall smoking, empty coffee-cups and liqueur-glasses before them on the tables.
Manuel went through the long room to a small room in back.
A man sat at a table in the corner asleep.
Manuel sat down at one of the tables.
A waiter came in and stood beside Manuel's table.
"Have you seen Zurito?" Manuel asked him.
"He was in before lunch," the waiter answered. "He won't be back before five o'clock."
"Bring me some coffee and milk and a shot of the ordinary," Manuel said.
The waiter came back into the room carrying a tray with a big coffee-glass and a liqueur-glass on it.
In his left hand he held a bottle of brandy.
He swung these down to the table and a boy who had followed him poured coffee and milk into the glass from two shiny, spouted pots with long handles.
Manuel took off his cap and the waiter noticed his pigtail pinned forward on his head.
He winked at the coffee-boy as he poured out the brandy into the little glass beside Manuel's coffee.
The coffee-boy looked at Manuel's pale face curiously.
"You fighting here?" asked the waiter, corking up the bottle.
"Yes," Manuel said. "To-morrow."
The waiter stood there, holding the bottle on one hip.
"You in the Charlie Chaplins?" he asked.
The coffee-boy looked away, embarrassed.
"No. In the ordinary."
"I thought they were going to have Chaves and Hernandez," the waiter said.
"No. Me and another."
"Who? Chaves or Hernandez?"
"Hernandez, I think."
"What's the matter with Chaves?"
"He got hurt."
"Where did you hear that?"
"Retana."
"Hey, Looie," the waiter called to the next room, "Chaves got cogida."
Manuel had taken the wrapper off the lumps of sugar and dropped them into his coffee.
He stirred it and drank it down, sweet, hot, and warming in his empty stomach.
He drank off the brandy.
"Give me another shot of that," he said to the waiter.
The waiter uncorked the bottle and poured the glass full, slopping another drink into the saucer.
Another waiter had come up in front of the table.
The coffee-boy was gone.
"Is Chaves hurt bad?" the second waiter asked Manuel.
"I don't know," Manuel said, "Retana didn't say."
"A hell of a lot he cares," the tall waiter said. Manuel had not seen him before. He must have just come up.
"If you stand in with Retana in this town, you're a made man," the tall waiter said. "If you aren't in with him, you might just as well go out and shoot yourself."
"You said it," the other waiter who had come in said. "You said it then."
"You're right I said it," said the tall waiter. "I know what I'm talking about when I talk about that bird."
"Look what he's done for Villalta," the first waiter said.
"And that ain't all," the tall waiter said. "Look what he's done for Marcial Lalanda. Look what he's done for Nacional."
"You said it, kid," agreed the short waiter.
Manuel looked at them, standing talking in front of his table.
He had drunk his second brandy.
They had forgotten about him.
They were not interested in him.
"Look at that bunch of camels," the tall waiter went on. "Did you ever see this Nacional II?"
"I seen him last Sunday didn't I?" the original waiter said.
"He's a giraffe," the short waiter said.
"What did I tell you?" the tall waiter said. "Those are Retana's boys."
"Say, give me another shot of that," Manuel said. He had poured the brandy the waiter had slopped over in the saucer into his glass and drank it while they were talking.
The original waiter poured his glass full mechanically, and the three of them went out of the room talking.
In the far corner the man was still asleep, snoring slightly on the intaking breath, his head back against the wall.
Manuel drank his brandy.
He felt sleepy himself.
It was too hot to go out into the town.
Besides there was nothing to do.
He wanted to see Zurito.
He would go to sleep while he waited.
He kicked his suitcase under the table to be sure it was there.
Perhaps it would be better to put it back under the seat, against the wall.
He leaned down and shoved it under.
Then he leaned forward on the table and went to sleep.
When he woke there was some one sitting across the table from him.
It was a big man with a heavy brown face like an Indian.
He had been sitting there some time.
He had waved the waiter away and sat reading the paper and occasionally looking down at Manuel, asleep, his head on the table.
He read the paper laboriously, forming the words with his lips as he read.
When it tired him he looked at Manuel.
He sat heavily in the chair, his black Cordoba hat tipped forward.
Manuel sat up and looked at him.
"Hello, Zurito," he said.
"Hello, kid," the big man said.
"I've been asleep." Manuel rubbed his forehead with the back of his fist.
"I thought maybe you were."
"How's everything?"
"Good. How is everything with you?"
"Not so good."
They were both silent.
Zurito, the picador, looked at Manuel's white face.
Manuel looked down at the picador's enormous hands folding the paper to put away in his pocket.
"I got a favor to ask you, Manos," Manuel said.
Manosduros was Zurito's nickname.
He never heard it without thinking of his huge hands.
He put them forward on the table self-consciously.
"Let's have a drink," he said.
"Sure," said Manuel.
The waiter came and went and came again.
He went out of the room looking back at the two men at the table.
"What's the matter, Manolo?" Zurito set down his glass.
"Would you pic two bulls for me to-morrow night?" Manuel asked, looking up at Zurito across the table.
"No," said Zurito. "I'm not pic-ing."
Manuel looked down at his glass.
He had expected that answer; now he had it.
Well, he had it.
"I'm sorry, Manolo, but I'm not pic-ing." Zurito looked at his hands.
"That's all right," Manuel said.
"I'm too old," Zurito said.
"I just asked you," Manuel said.
"Is it the nocturnal to-morrow?"
"That's it. I figured if I had just one good pic, I could get away with it."
"How much are you getting?"
"Three hundred pesetas."
"I get more than that for pic-ing."
"I know," said Manuel. "I didn't have any right to ask you."
"What do you keep on doing it for?" Zurito asked. "Why don't you cut off your coleta, Manolo?"
"I don't know," Manuel said.
"You're pretty near as old as I am," Zurito said.
"I don't know," Manuel said. "I got to do it. If I can fix it so that I get an even break, that's all I want. I got to stick with it, Manos."
"No, you don't."
"Yes, I do. I've tried keeping away from it."
"I know how you feel. But it isn't right. You ought to get out and stay out."
"I can't do it. Besides, I've been going good lately."
Zurito looked at his face.
"You've been in the hospital."
"But I was going great when I got hurt."
Zurito said nothing.
He tipped the cognac out of his saucer into his glass.
"The papers said they never saw a better faena," Manuel said.
Zurito looked at him.
"You know when I get going I'm good," Manuel said.
"You're too old," the picador said.
"No," said Manuel. "You're ten years older than I am."
"With me it's different."
"I'm not too old," Manuel said.
They sat silent, Manuel watching the picador's face.
"I was going great till I got hurt," Manuel offered.
"You ought to have seen me, Manos," Manuel said, reproachfully.
"I don't want to see you," Zurito said. "It makes me nervous."
"You haven't seen me lately."
"I've seen you plenty."
Zurito looked at Manuel, avoiding his eyes.
"You ought to quit it, Manolo."
"I can't," Manuel said. "I'm going good now, I tell you."
Zurito leaned forward, his hands on the table.
"Listen. I'll pic for you and if you don't go big to-morrow night, you'll quit. See? Will you do that?"
"Sure."
Zurito leaned back, relieved.
"You got to quit," he said. "No monkey business. You got to cut the coleta."
"I won't have to quit," Manuel said. "You watch me. I've got the stuff."
Zurito stood up.
He felt tired from arguing.
"You got to quit," he said. "I'll cut your coleta myself."
"No, you won't," Manuel said. "You won't have a chance."
Zurito called the waiter.
"Come on," said Zurito. "Come on up to the house."
Manuel reached under the seat for his suitcase.
He was happy.
He knew Zurito would pic for him.
He was the best picador living.
It was all simple now.
"Come on up to the house and we'll eat," Zurito said.
* * * * *.
Manuel stood in the patio de caballos waiting for the Charlie Chaplins to be over.
Zurito stood beside him.
Where they stood it was dark.
The high door that led into the bull-ring was shut.
Above them they heard a shout, then another shout of laughter.
Then there was silence.
Manuel liked the smell of the stables about the patio de caballos.
It smelt good in the dark.
There was another roar from the arena and then applause, prolonged applause, going on and on.
"You ever seen these fellows?" Zurito asked, big and looming beside Manuel in the dark.
"No," Manuel said.
"They're pretty funny." Zurito said. He smiled to himself in the dark.
The high, double, tight-fitting door into the bull-ring swung open and Manuel saw the ring in the hard light of the arc-lights, the plaza, dark all the way around, rising high; around the edge of the ring were running and bowing two men dressed like tramps, followed by a third in the uniform of a hotel bell-boy who stooped and picked up the hats and canes thrown down onto the sand and tossed them back up into the darkness.
The electric light went on in the patio.
"I'll climb onto one of those ponies while you collect the kids," Zurito said.
Behind them came the jingle of the mules, coming out to go into the arena and be hitched onto the dead bull.
The members of the cuadrilla, who had been watching the burlesque from the runway between the barrera and the seats, came walking back and stood in a group talking, under the electric light in the patio.
A good-looking lad in a silver-and-orange suit came up to Manuel and smiled.
"I'm Hernandez," he said and put out his hand.
Manuel shook it.
"They're regular elephants we've got to-night," the boy said cheerfully.
"They're big ones with horns," Manuel agreed.
"You drew the worst lot," the boy said.
"That's all right," Manuel said. "The bigger they are, the more meat for the poor."
"Where did you get that one?" Hernandez grinned.
"That's an old one," Manuel said. "You line up your cuadrilla, so I can see what I've got."
"You've got some good kids," Hernandez said. He was very cheerful. He had been on twice before in nocturnals and was beginning to get a following in Madrid. He was happy the fight would start in a few minutes.
"Where are the pics?" Manuel asked.
"They're back in the corrals fighting about who gets the beautiful horses," Hernandez grinned.
The mules came through the gate in a rush, the whips snapping, bells jangling and the young bull ploughing a furrow of sand.
They formed up for the paseo as soon as the bull had gone through.
Manuel and Hernandez stood in front.
The youths of the cuadrillas were behind, their heavy capes furled over their arms.
In back, the four picadors, mounted, holding their steel-tipped push-poles erect in the half-dark of the corral.
"It's a wonder Retana wouldn't give us enough light to see the horses by," one picador said.
"He knows we'll be happier if we don't get too good a look at these skins," another pic answered.
"This thing I'm on barely keeps me off the ground," the first picador said.
"Well, they're horses."
"Sure, they're horses."
They talked, sitting their gaunt horses in the dark.
Zurito said nothing.
He had the only steady horse of the lot.
He had tried him, wheeling him in the corrals and he responded to the bit and the spurs.
He had taken the bandage off his right eye and cut the strings where they had tied his ears tight shut at the base.
He was a good, solid horse, solid on his legs.
That was all he needed.
He intended to ride him all through the corrida.
He had already, since he had mounted, sitting in the half-dark in the big, quilted saddle, waiting for the paseo, pic-ed through the whole corrida in his mind.
The other picadors went on talking on both sides of him.
He did not hear them.
The two matadors stood together in front of their three peones, their capes furled over their left arms in the same fashion.
Manuel was thinking about the three lads in back of him.
They were all three Madrileños, like Hernandez, boys about nineteen.
One of them, a gypsy, serious, aloof, and dark-faced, he liked the look of.
He turned.
"What's your name, kid?" he asked the gypsy.
"Fuentes," the gypsy said.
"That's a good name," Manuel said.
The gypsy smiled, showing his teeth.
"You take the bull and give him a little run when he comes out," Manuel said.
"All right," the gypsy said. His face was serious. He began to think about just what he would do.
"Here she goes," Manuel said to Hernandez.
"All right. We'll go."
Heads up, swinging with the music, their right arms swinging free, they stepped out, crossing the sanded arena under the arc-lights, the cuadrillas opening out behind, the picadors riding after, behind came the bull-ring servants and the jingling mules.
The crowd applauded Hernandez as they marched across the arena.
Arrogant, swinging, they looked straight ahead as they marched.
They bowed before the president, and the procession broke up into its component parts.
The bull-fighters went over to the barrera and changed their heavy mantles for the light fighting capes.
The mules went out.
The picadors galloped jerkily around the ring, and two rode out the gate they had come in by.
The servants swept the sand smooth.
Manuel drank a glass of water poured for him by one of Retana's deputies, who was acting as his manager and sword-handler.
Hernandez came over from speaking with his own manager.
"You got a good hand, kid," Manuel complimented him.
"They like me," Hernandez said happily.
"How did the paseo go?" Manuel asked Retana's man.
"Like a wedding," said the handler. "Fine. You came out like Joselito and Belmonte."
Zurito rode by, a bulky equestrian statue.
He wheeled his horse and faced him toward the toril on the far side of the ring where the bull would come out.
It was strange under the arc-light.
He pic-ed in the hot afternoon sun for big money.
He didn't like this arc-light business.
He wished they would get started.
Manuel went up to him.
"Pic him, Manos," he said. "Cut him down to size for me."
"I'll pic him, kid," Zurito spat on the sand. "I'll make him jump out of the ring."
"Lean on him, Manos," Manuel said.
"I'll lean on him," Zurito said. "What's holding it up?"
"He's coming now," Manuel said.
Zurito sat there, his feet in the box-stirrups, his great legs in the buckskin-covered armor gripping the horse, the reins in his left hand, the long pic held in his right hand, his broad hat well down over his eyes to shade them from the lights, watching the distant door of the toril.
His horse's ears quivered.
Zurito patted him with his left hand.
The red door of the toril swung back and for a moment Zurito looked into the empty passageway far across the arena.
Then the bull came out in a rush, skidding on his four legs as he came out under the lights, then charging in a gallop, moving softly in a fast gallop, silent except as he woofed through wide nostrils as he charged, glad to be free after the dark pen.
In the first row of seats, slightly bored, leaning forward to write on the cement wall in front of his knees, the substitute bull-fight critic of El Heraldo scribbled: "Campagnero, Negro, 42, came out at 90 miles an hour with plenty of gas----".
Manuel, leaning against the barrera, watching the bull, waved his hand and the gypsy ran out, trailing his cape.
The bull, in full gallop, pivoted and charged the cape, his head down, his tail rising.
The gypsy moved in a zigzag, and as he passed, the bull caught sight of him and abandoned the cape to charge the man.
The gyp sprinted and vaulted the red fence of the barrera as the bull struck it with his horns.
He tossed into it twice with his horns, banging into the wood blindly.
The critic of El Heraldo lit a cigarette and tossed the match at the bull, then wrote in his note-book, "large and with enough horns to satisfy the cash customers, Campagnero showed a tendency to cut into the terrane of the bull-fighters.
Manuel stepped out on the hard sand as the bull banged into the fence.
Out of the corner of his eye he saw Zurito sitting the white horse close to the barrera, about a quarter of the way around the ring to the left.
Manuel held the cape close in front of him, a fold in each hand, and shouted at the bull.
"Huh! Huh!" The bull turned, seemed to brace against the fence as he charged in a scramble, driving into the cape as Manuel side-stepped, pivoted on his heels with the charge of the bull, and swung the cape just ahead of the horns.
At the end of the swing he was facing the bull again and held the cape in the same position close in front of his body, and pivoted again as the bull recharged.
Each time, as he swung, the crowd shouted.
Four times he swung with the bull, lifting the cape so it billowed full, and each time bringing the bull around to charge again.
Then, at the end of the fifth swing, he held the cape against his hip and pivoted, so the cape swung out like a ballet dancer's skirt and wound the bull around himself like a belt, to step clear, leaving the bull facing Zurito on the white horse, come up and planted firm, the horse facing the bull, its ears forward, its lips nervous, Zurito, his hat over his eyes, leaning forward, the long pole sticking out before and behind in a sharp angle under his right arm, held half-way down, the triangular iron point facing the bull.
El Heraldo's second-string critic, drawing on his cigarette, his eyes on the bull, wrote: "the veteran Manolo designed a series of acceptable veronicas, ending in a very Belmontistic recorte that earned applause from the regulars, and we entered the tercio of the cavalry.
Zurito sat his horse, measuring the distance between the bull and the end of the pic.
As he looked, the bull gathered himself together and charged, his eyes on the horse's chest.
As he lowered his head to hook, Zurito sunk the point of the pic in the swelling hump of muscle above the bull's shoulder, leaned all his weight on the shaft, and with his left hand pulled the white horse into the air, front hoofs pawing, and swung him to the right as he pushed the bull under and through so the horns passed safely under the horse's belly and the horse came down, quivering, the bull's tail brushing his chest as he charged the cape Hernandez offered him.
Hernandez ran sideways, taking the bull out and away with the cape, toward the other picador.
He fixed him with a swing of the cape, squarely facing the horse and rider, and stepped back.
As the bull saw the horse he charged.
The picador's lance slid along his back, and as the shock of the charge lifted the horse, the picador was already half-way out of the saddle, lifting his right leg clear as he missed with the lance and falling to the left side to keep the horse between him and the bull.
The horse, lifted and gored, crashed over with the bull driving into him, the picador gave a shove with his boots against the horse and lay clear, waiting to be lifted and hauled away and put on his feet.
Manuel let the bull drive into the fallen horse; he was in no hurry, the picador was safe; besides, it did a picador like that good to worry.
He'd stay on longer next time.
Lousy pics! He looked across the sand at Zurito a little way out from the barrera, his horse rigid, waiting.
"Huh!" he called to the bull, "Tomar!" holding the cape in both hands so it would catch his eye. The bull detached himself from the horse and charged the cape, and Manuel, running sideways and holding the cape spread wide, stopped, swung on his heels, and brought the bull sharply around facing Zurito.
"Campagnero accepted a pair of varas for the death of one rosinante, with Hernandez and Manolo at the quites," El Heraldo's critic wrote. "He pressed on the iron and clearly showed he was no horse-lover. The veteran Zurito resurrected some of his old stuff with the pike-pole, notably the suerte----"
"Olé Olé!" the man sitting beside him shouted. The shout was lost in the roar of the crowd, and he slapped the critic on the back. The critic looked up to see Zurito, directly below him, leaning far out over his horse, the length of the pic rising in a sharp angle under his armpit, holding the pic almost by the point, bearing down with all his weight, holding the bull off, the bull pushing and driving to get at the horse, and Zurito, far out, on top of him, holding him, holding him, and slowly pivoting the horse against the pressure, so that at last he was clear. Zurito felt the moment when the horse was clear and the bull could come past, and relaxed the absolute steel lock of his resistance, and the triangular steel point of the pic ripped in the bull's hump of shoulder muscle as he tore loose to find Hernandez's cape before his muzzle. He charged blindly into the cape and the boy took him out into the open arena.
Zurito sat patting his horse and looking at the bull charging the cape that Hernandez swung for him out under the bright light while the crowd shouted.
"You see that one?" he said to Manuel.
"It was a wonder," Manuel said.
"I got him that time," Zurito said. "Look at him now."
At the conclusion of a closely turned pass of the cape the bull slid to his knees.
He was up at once, but far out across the sand Manuel and Zurito saw the shine of the pumping flow of blood, smooth against the black of the bull's shoulder.
"I got him that time," Zurito said.
"He's a good bull," Manuel said.
"If they gave me another shot at him, I'd kill him," Zurito said.
"They'll change the thirds on us," Manuel said.
"Look at him now," Zurito said.
"I got to go over there," Manuel said, and started on a run for the other side of the ring, where the monos were leading a horse out by the bridle toward the bull, whacking him on the legs with rods and all, in a procession, trying to get him toward the bull, who stood, dropping his head, pawing, unable to make up his mind to charge.
Zurito, sitting his horse, walking him toward the scene, not missing any detail, scowled.
Finally the bull charged, the horse leaders ran for the barrera, the picador hit too far back, and the bull got under the horse, lifted him, threw him onto his back.
Zurito watched.
The monos, in their red shirts, running out to drag the picador clear.
The picador, now on his feet, swearing and flopping his arms.
Manuel and Hernandez standing ready with their capes.
And the bull, the great, black bull, with a horse on his back, hooves dangling, the bridle caught in the horns.
Black bull with a horse on his back, staggering short-legged, then arching his neck and lifting, thrusting, charging to slide the horse off, horse sliding down.
Then the bull into a lunging charge at the cape Manuel spread for him.
The bull was slower now, Manuel felt.
He was bleeding badly.
There was a sheen of blood all down his flank.
Manuel offered him the cape again.
There he came, eyes open, ugly, watching the cape.
Manuel stepped to the side and raised his arms, tightening the cape ahead of the bull for the veronica.
Now he was facing the bull.
Yes, his head was going down a little.
He was carrying it lower.
That was Zurito.
Manuel flopped the cape; there he comes; he side-stepped and swung in another veronica.
He's shooting awfully accurately, he thought.
He's had enough fight, so he's watching now.
He's hunting now.
Got his eye on me.
But I always give him the cape.
He shook the cape at the bull; there he comes; he side-stepped.
Awful close that time.
I don't want to work that close to him.
The edge of the cape was wet with blood where it had swept along the bull's back as he went by.
All right, here's the last one.
Manuel, facing the bull, having turned with him each charge, offered the cape with his two hands.
The bull looked at him.
Eyes watching, horns straight forward, the bull looked at him, watching.
"Huh!" Manuel said, "Toro!" and leaning back, swung the cape forward. Here he comes. He side-stepped, swung the cape in back of him, and pivoted, so the bull followed a swirl of cape and then was left with nothing, fixed by the pass, dominated by the cape. Manuel swung the cape under his muzzle with one hand, to show the bull was fixed, and walked away.
There was no applause.
Manuel walked across the sand toward the barrera, while Zurito rode out of the ring.
The trumpet had blown to change the act to the planting of the banderillos while Manuel had been working with the bull.
He had not consciously noticed it.
The monos were spreading canvas over the two dead horses and sprinkling sawdust around them.
Manuel came up to the barrera for a drink of water.
Retana's man handed him the heavy porous jug.
Fuentes, the tall gypsy, was standing holding a pair of banderillos, holding them together, slim, red sticks, fish-hook points out.
He looked at Manuel.
"Go on out there," Manuel said.
The gypsy trotted out.
Manuel set down the jug and watched.
He wiped his face with his handkerchief.
The critic of El Heraldo reached for the bottle of warm champagne that stood between his feet, took a drink, and finished his paragraph.
"--the aged Manolo rated no applause for a vulgar series of lances with the cape and we entered the third of the palings."
Alone in the centre of the ring the bull stood, still fixed.
Fuentes, tall, flat-backed, walking toward him arrogantly, his arms spread out, the two slim, red sticks, one in each hand, held by the fingers, points straight forward.
Fuentes walked forward.
Back of him and to one side was a peon with a cape.
The bull looked at him and was no longer fixed.
His eyes watched Fuentes, now standing still.
Now he leaned back, calling to him.
Fuentes twitched the two banderillos and the light on the steel points caught the bull's eye.
His tail went up and he charged.
He came straight, his eyes on the man.
Fuentes stood still, leaning back, the banderillos pointing forward.
As the bull lowered his head to hook, Fuentes leaned backward, his arms came together and rose, his two hands touching, the banderillos two descending red lines, and leaning forward drove the points into the bull's shoulder, leaning far in over the bull's horns and pivoting on the two upright sticks, his legs tight together, his body curving to one side to let the bull pass.
"Olé!" from the crowd.
The bull was hooking wildly, jumping like a trout, all four feet off the ground.
The red shaft of the banderillos tossed as he jumped.
Manuel standing at the barrera, noticed that he hooked always to the right.
"Tell him to drop the next pair on the right," he said to the kid who started to run out to Fuentes with the new banderillos.
A heavy hand fell on his shoulder.
It was Zurito.
"How do you feel, kid?" he asked.
Manuel was watching the bull.
Zurito leaned forward on the barrera, leaning the weight of his body on his arms.
Manuel turned to him.
"You're going good," Zurito said.
Manuel shook his head.
He had nothing to do now until the next third.
The gypsy was very good with the banderillos.
The bull would come to him in the next third in good shape.
He was a good bull.
It had all been easy up to now.
The final stuff with the sword was all he worried over.
He did not really worry.
He did not even think about it.
But standing there he had a heavy sense of apprehension.
He looked out at the bull, planning his faena, his work with the red cloth that was to reduce the bull, to make him manageable.
The gypsy was walking out toward the bull again, walking heel-and-toe, insultingly, like a ball-room dancer, the red shafts of the banderillos twitching with his walk.
The bull watched him, not fixed now, hunting him, but waiting to get close enough so he could be sure of getting him, getting the horns into him.
As Fuentes walked forward the bull charged.
Fuentes ran across the quarter of a circle as the bull charged and, as he passed running backward, stopped, swung forward, rose on his toes, arms straight out, and sunk the banderillos straight down into the tight of the big shoulder muscles as the bull missed him.
The crowd were wild about it.
"That kid won't stay in this night stuff long," Retana's man said to Zurito.
"He's good," Zurito said.
"Watch him now."
They watched.
Fuentes was standing with his back against the barrera.
Two of the cuadrilla were back of him, with their capes ready to flop over the fence to distract the bull.
The bull, with his tongue out, his barrel heaving, was watching the gypsy.
He thought he had him now.
Back against the red planks.
Only a short charge away.
The bull watched him.
The gypsy bent back, drew back his arms, the banderillos pointing at the bull.
He called to the bull, stamped one foot.
The bull was suspicious.
He wanted the man.
No more barbs in the shoulder.
Fuentes walked a little closer to the bull.
Bent back.
Called again.
Somebody in the crowd shouted a warning.
"He's too damn close," Zurito said.
"Watch him," Retana's man said.
Leaning back, inciting the bull with the banderillos, Fuentes jumped, both feet off the ground.
As he jumped the bull's tail rose and he charged.
Fuentes came down on his toes, arms straight out, whole body arching forward, and drove the shafts straight down as he swung his body clear of the right horn.
The bull crashed into the barrera where the flopping capes had attracted his eye as he lost the man.
The gypsy came running along the barrera toward Manuel, taking the applause of the crowd.
His vest was ripped where he had not quite cleared the point of the horn.
He was happy about it, showing it to the spectators.
He made the tour of the ring.
Zurito saw him go by, smiling, pointing at his vest.
He smiled.
Somebody else was planting the last pair of banderillos.
Nobody was paying any attention.
Retana's man tucked a baton inside the red cloth of a muleta, folded the cloth over it, and handed it over the barrera to Manuel.
He reached in the leather sword-case, took out a sword, and holding it by its leather scabbard, reached it over the fence to Manuel.
Manuel pulled the blade out by the red hilt and the scabbard fell limp.
He looked at Zurito.
The big man saw he was sweating.
"Now you get him, kid," Zurito said.
Manuel nodded.
"He's in good shape," Zurito said.
"Just like you want him," Retana's man assured him.
Manuel nodded.
The trumpeter, up under the roof, blew for the final act, and Manuel walked across the arena toward where, up in the dark boxes, the president must be.
In the front row of seats the substitute bull-fight critic of El Heraldo took a long drink of the warm champagne.
He had decided it was not worth while to write a running story and would write up the corrida back in the office.
What the hell was it anyway? Only a nocturnal.
If he missed anything he would get it out of the morning papers.
He took another drink of the champagne.
He had a date at Maxim's at twelve.
Who were these bull-fighters anyway? Kids and bums.
A bunch of bums.
He put his pad of paper in his pocket and looked over toward Manuel, standing very much alone in the ring, gesturing with his hat in a salute toward a box he could not see high up in the dark plaza.
Out in the ring the bull stood quiet, looking at nothing.
"I dedicate this bull to you, Mr. President, and to the public of Madrid, the most intelligent and generous of the world," was what Manuel was saying. It was a formula. He said it all. It was a little long for nocturnal use.
He bowed at the dark, straightened, tossed his hat over his shoulder, and, carrying the muleta in his left hand and the sword in his right, walked out toward the bull.
Manuel walked toward the bull.
The bull looked at him; his eyes were quick.
Manuel noticed the way the banderillos hung down on his left shoulder and the steady sheen of blood from Zurito's pic-ing.
He noticed the way the bull's feet were.
As he walked forward, holding the muleta in his left hand and the sword in his right, he watched the bull's feet.
The bull could not charge without gathering his feet together.
Now he stood square on them, dully.
Manuel walked toward him, watching his feet.
This was all right.
He could do this.
He must work to get the bull's head down, so he could go in past the horns and kill him.
He did not think about the sword, not about killing the bull.
He thought about one thing at a time.
The coming things oppressed him, though.
Walking forward, watching the bull's feet, he saw successively his eyes, his wet muzzle, and the wide, forward-pointing spread of his horns.
The bull had light circles about his eyes.
His eyes watched Manuel.
He felt he was going to get this little one with the white face.
Standing still now and spreading the red cloth of the muleta with the sword, pricking the point into the cloth so that the sword, now held in his left hand, spread the red flannel like the jib of a boat, Manuel noticed the points of the bull's horns.
One of them was splintered from banging against the barrera.
The other was sharp as a porcupine quill.
Manuel noticed while spreading the muleta that the white base of the horn was stained red.
While he noticed these things he did not lose sight of the bull's feet.
The bull watched Manuel steadily.
He's on the defensive now, Manuel thought.
He's reserving himself.
I've got to bring him out of that and get his head down.
Always get his head down.
Zurito had his head down once, but he's come back.
He'll bleed when I start him going and that will bring it down.
Holding the muleta, with the sword in his left hand widening it in front of him, he called to the bull.
The bull looked at him.
He leaned back insultingly and shook the wide-spread flannel.
The bull saw the muleta.
It was a bright scarlet under the arc-light.
The bull's legs tightened.
Here he comes.
Whoosh! Manuel turned as the bull came and raised the muleta so that it passed over the bull's horns and swept down his broad back from head to tail.
The bull had gone clean up in the air with the charge.
Manuel had not moved.
At the end of the pass the bull turned like a cat coming around a corner and faced Manuel.
He was on the offensive again.
His heaviness was gone.
Manuel noted the fresh blood shining down the black shoulder and dripping down the bull's leg.
He drew the sword out of the muleta and held it in his right hand.
The muleta held low down in his left hand, leaning toward the left, he called to the bull.
The bull's legs tightened, his eyes on the muleta.
Here he comes, Manuel thought.
Yuh!.
He swung with the charge, sweeping the muleta ahead of the bull, his feet firm, the sword following the curve, a point of light under the arcs.
The bull recharged as the pase natural finished and Manuel raised the muleta for a pase de pecho.
Firmly planted, the bull came by his chest under the raised muleta.
Manuel leaned his head back to avoid the clattering banderillo shafts.
The hot, black bull body touched his chest as it passed.
Too damn close, Manuel thought.
Zurito, leaning on the barrera, spoke rapidly to the gypsy, who trotted out toward Manuel with a cape.
Zurito pulled his hat down low and looked out across the arena at Manuel.
Manuel was facing the bull again, the muleta held low and to the left.
The bull's head was down as he watched the muleta.
"If it was Belmonte doing that stuff, they'd go crazy," Retana's man said.
Zurito said nothing.
He was watching Manuel out in the centre of the arena.
"Where did the boss dig this fellow up?" Retana's man asked.
"Out of the hospital," Zurito said.
"That's where he's going damn quick," Retana's man said.
Zurito turned on him.
"Knock on that," he said, pointing to the barrera.
"I was just kidding, man," Retana's man said.
"Knock on the wood."
Retana's man leaned forward and knocked three times on the barrera.
"Watch the faena," Zurito said.
Out in the centre of the ring, under the lights, Manuel was kneeling, facing the bull, and as he raised the muleta in both hands the bull charged, tail up.
Manuel swung his body clear and, as the bull recharged, brought around the muleta in a half-circle that pulled the bull to his knees.
"Why, that one's a great bull-fighter," Retana's man said.
"No, he's not," said Zurito.
Manuel stood up and, the muleta in his left hand, the sword in his right, acknowledged the applause from the dark plaza.
The bull had humped himself up from his knees and stood waiting, his head hung low.
Zurito spoke to two of the other lads of the cuadrilla and they ran out to stand back of Manuel with their capes.
There were four men back of him now.
Hernandez had followed him since he first came out with the muleta.
Fuentes stood watching, his cape held against his body, tall, in repose, watching lazy-eyed.
Now the two came up.
Hernandez motioned them to stand one at each side.
Manuel stood alone, facing the bull.
Manuel waved back the men with the capes.
Stepping back cautiously, they saw his face was white and sweating.
Didn't they know enough to keep back? Did they want to catch the bull's eye with the capes after he was fixed and ready? He had enough to worry about without that kind of thing.
The bull was standing, his four feet square, looking at the muleta.
Manuel furled the muleta in his left hand.
The bull's eyes watched it.
His body was heavy on his feet.
He carried his head low, but not too low.
Manuel lifted the muleta at him.
The bull did not move.
Only his eyes watched.
He's all lead, Manuel thought.
He's all square.
He's framed right.
He'll take it.
He thought in bull-fight terms.
Sometimes he had a thought and the particular piece of slang would not come into his mind and he could not realize the thought.
His instincts and his knowledge worked automatically, and his brain worked slowly and in words.
He knew all about bulls.
He did not have to think about them.
He just did the right thing.
His eyes noted things and his body performed the necessary measures without thought.
If he thought about it, he would be gone.
Now, facing the bull, he was conscious of many things at the same time.
There were the horns, the one splintered, the other smoothly sharp, the need to profile himself toward the left horn, lance himself short and straight, lower the muleta so the bull would follow it, and, going in over the horns, put the sword all the way into a little spot about as big as a five-peseta piece straight in back of the neck, between the sharp pitch of the bull's shoulders.
He must do all this and must then come out from between the horns.
He was conscious he must do all this, but his only thought was in words: "Corto y derecho.
"Corto y derecho," he thought, furling the muleta. Short and straight. Corto y derecho, he drew the sword out of the muleta, profiled on the splintered left horn, dropped the muleta across his body, so his right hand with the sword on the level with his eye made the sign of the cross, and, rising on his toes, sighted along the dipping blade of the sword at the spot high up between the bull's shoulders.
Corto y derecho he lanced himself on the bull.
There was a shock, and he felt himself go up in the air.
He pushed on the sword as he went up and over, and it flew out of his hand.
He hit the ground and the bull was on him.
Manuel, lying on the ground, kicked at the bull's muzzle with his slippered feet.
Kicking, kicking, the bull after him, missing him in his excitement, bumping him with his head, driving the horns into the sand.
Kicking like a man keeping a ball in the air, Manuel kept the bull from getting a clean thrust at him.
Manuel felt the wind on his back from the capes flopping at the bull, and then the bull was gone, gone over him in a rush.
Dark, as his belly went over.
Not even stepped on.
Manuel stood up and picked up the muleta.
Fuentes handed him the sword.
It was bent where it had struck the shoulder-blade.
Manuel straightened it on his knee and ran toward the bull, standing now beside one of the dead horses.
As he ran, his jacket flopped where it had been ripped under his armpit.
"Get him out of there," Manuel shouted to the gypsy. The bull had smelled the blood of the dead horse and ripped into the canvas-cover with his horns. He charged Fuentes's cape, with the canvas hanging from his splintered horn, and the crowd laughed. Out in the ring, he tossed his head to rid himself of the canvas. Hernandez, running up from behind him, grabbed the end of the canvas and neatly lifted it off the horn.
The bull followed it in a half-charge and stopped still.
He was on the defensive again.
Manuel was walking toward him with the sword and muleta.
Manuel swung the muleta before him.
The bull would not charge.
Manuel profiled toward the bull, sighting along the dipping blade of the sword.
The bull was motionless, seemingly dead on his feet, incapable of another charge.
Manuel rose to his toes, sighting along the steel, and charged.
Again there was the shock and he felt himself being borne back in a rush, to strike hard on the sand.
There was no chance of kicking this time.
The bull was on top of him.
Manuel lay as though dead, his head on his arms, and the bull bumped him.
Bumped his back, bumped his face in the sand.
He felt the horn go into the sand between his folded arms.
The bull hit him in the small of the back.
His face drove into the sand.
The horn drove through one of his sleeves and the bull ripped it off.
Manuel was tossed clear and the bull followed the capes.
Manuel got up, found the sword and muleta, tried the point of the sword with his thumb, and then ran toward the barrera for a new sword.
Retana's man handed him the sword over the edge of the barrera.
"Wipe off your face," he said.
Manuel, running again toward the bull, wiped his bloody face with his handkerchief.
He had not seen Zurito.
Where was Zurito?.
The cuadrilla had stepped away from the bull and waited with their capes.
The bull stood, heavy and dull again after the action.
Manuel walked toward him with the muleta.
He stopped and shook it.
The bull did not respond.
He passed it right and left, left and right before the bull's muzzle.
The bull's eyes watched it and turned with the swing, but he would not charge.
He was waiting for Manuel.
Manuel was worried.
There was nothing to do but go in.
Corto y derecho.
He profiled close to the bull, crossed the muleta in front of his body and charged.
As he pushed in the sword, he jerked his body to the left to clear the horn.
The bull passed him and the sword shot up in the air, twinkling under the arc-lights, to fall red-hilted on the sand.
Manuel ran over and picked it up.
It was bent and he straightened it over his knee.
As he came running toward the bull, fixed again now, he passed Hernandez standing with his cape.
"He's all bone," the boy said encouragingly.
Manuel nodded, wiping his face.
He put the bloody handkerchief in his pocket.
There was the bull.
He was close to the barrera now.
Damn him.
Maybe he was all bone.
Maybe there was not any place for the sword to go in.
The hell there wasn't! He'd show them.
He tried a pass with the muleta and the bull did not move.
Manuel chopped the muleta back and forth in front of the bull.
Nothing doing.
He furled the muleta, drew the sword out, profiled and drove in on the bull.
He felt the sword buckle as he shoved it in, leaning his weight on it, and then it shot high in the air, end-over-ending into the crowd.
Manuel had jerked clear as the sword jumped.
The first cushions thrown down out of the dark missed him.
Then one hit him in the face, his bloody face looking toward the crowd.
They were coming down fast.
Spotting the sand.
Somebody threw an empty champagne-bottle from close range.
It hit Manuel on the foot.
He stood there watching the dark, where the things were coming from.
Then something whished through the air and struck by him.
Manuel leaned over and picked it up.
It was his sword.
He straightened it over his knee and gestured with it to the crowd.
"Thank you," he said. "Thank you."
Oh, the dirty bastards! Dirty bastards! Oh, the lousy, dirty bastards! He kicked into a cushion as he ran.
There was the bull.
The same as ever.
All right, you dirty, lousy bastard!.
Manuel passed the muleta in front of the bull's black muzzle.
Nothing doing.
You won't! All right.
He stepped close and jammed the sharp peak of the muleta into the bull's damp muzzle.
The bull was on him as he jumped back and as he tripped on a cushion he felt the horn go into him, into his side.
He grabbed the horn with his two hands and rode backward, holding tight onto the place.
The bull tossed him and he was clear.
He lay still.
It was all right.
The bull was gone.
He got up coughing and feeling broken and gone.
The dirty bastards!.
"Give me the sword," he shouted. "Give me the stuff."
Fuentes came up with the muleta and the sword.
Hernandez put his arm around him.
"Go on to the infirmary, man," he said. "Don't be a damn fool."
"Get away from me," Manuel said. "Get to hell away from me."
He twisted free.
Hernandez shrugged his shoulders.
Manuel ran toward the bull.
There was the bull standing, heavy, firmly planted.
All right, you bastard! Manuel drew the sword out of the muleta, sighted with the same movement, and flung himself onto the bull.
He felt the sword go in all the way.
Right up to the guard.
Four fingers and his thumb into the bull.
The blood was hot on his knuckles, and he was on top of the bull.
The bull lurched with him as he lay on, and seemed to sink; then he was standing clear.
He looked at the bull going down slowly over on his side, then suddenly four feet in the air.
Then he gestured at the crowd, his hand warm from the bull blood.
All right, you bastards! He wanted to say something, but he started to cough.
It was hot and choking.
He looked down for the muleta.
He must go over and salute the president.
President hell! He was sitting down looking at something.
It was the bull.
His four feet up.
Thick tongue out.
Things crawling around on his belly and under his legs.
Crawling where the hair was thin.
Dead bull.
To hell with the bull! To hell with them all! He started to get to his feet and commenced to cough.
He sat down again, coughing.
Somebody came and pushed him up.
They carried him across the ring to the infirmary, running with him across the sand, standing blocked at the gate as the mules came in, then around under the dark passageway, men grunting as they took him up the stairway, and then laid him down.
The doctor and two men in white were waiting for him.
They laid him out on the table.
They were cutting away his shirt.
Manuel felt tired.
His whole chest felt scalding inside.
He started to cough and they held something to his mouth.
Everybody was very busy.
There was an electric light in his eyes.
He shut his eyes.
He heard some one coming very heavily up the stairs.
Then he did not hear it.
Then he heard a noise far off.
That was the crowd.
Well, somebody would have to kill his other bull.
They had cut away all his shirt.
The doctor smiled at him.
There was Retana.
"Hello, Retana!" Manuel said. He could not hear his voice.
Retana smiled at him and said something.
Manuel could not hear it.
Zurito stood beside the table, bending over where the doctor was working.
He was in his picador clothes, without his hat.
Zurito said something to him.
Manuel could not hear it.
Zurito was speaking to Retana.
One of the men in white smiled and handed Retana a pair of scissors.
Retana gave them to Zurito.
Zurito said something to Manuel.
He could not hear it.
To hell with this operating-table! He'd been on plenty of operating-tables before.
He was not going to die.
There would be a priest if he was going to die.
Zurito was saying something to him.
Holding up the scissors.
That was it.
They were going to cut off his coleta.
They were going to cut off his pigtail.
Manuel sat up on the operating-table.
The doctor stepped back, angry.
Some one grabbed him and held him.
"You couldn't do a thing like that, Manos," he said.
He heard suddenly, clearly, Zurito's voice.
"That's all right," Zurito said. "I won't do it. I was joking."
"I was going good," Manuel said. "I didn't have any luck. That was all."
Manuel lay back.
They had put something over his face.
It was all familiar.
He inhaled deeply.
He felt very tired.
He was very, very tired.
They took the thing away from his face.
"I was going good," Manuel said weakly. "I was going great."
Retana looked at Zurito and started for the door.
"I'll stay here with him," Zurito said.
Retana shrugged his shoulders.
Manuel opened his eyes and looked at Zurito.
"Wasn't I going good, Manos?" he asked, for confirmation.
"Sure," said Zurito. "You were going great."
The doctor's assistant put the cone over Manuel's face and he inhaled deeply.
Zurito stood awkwardly, watching.
In Another Country.
In the fall the war was always there, but we did not go to it any more.
It was cold in the fall in Milan and the dark came very early.
Then the electric lights came on, and it was pleasant along the streets looking in the windows.
There was much game hanging outside the shops, and the snow powdered in the fur of the foxes and the wind blew their tails.
The deer hung stiff and heavy and empty, and small birds blew in the wind and the wind turned their feathers.
It was a cold fall and the wind came down from the mountains.
We were all at the hospital every afternoon, and there were different ways of walking across the town through the dusk to the hospital.
Two of the ways were alongside canals, but they were long.
Always, though, you crossed a bridge across a canal to enter the hospital.
There was a choice of three bridges.
On one of them a woman sold roasted chestnuts.
It was warm, standing in front of her charcoal fire, and the chestnuts were warm afterward in your pocket.
The hospital was very old and very beautiful, and you entered through a gate and walked across a courtyard and out a gate on the other side.
There were usually funerals starting from the courtyard.
Beyond the old hospital were the new brick pavilions, and there we met every afternoon and were all very polite and interested in what was the matter, and sat in the machines that were to make so much difference.
The doctor came up to the machine where I was sitting and said: "What did you like best to do before the war? Did you practise a sport?".
I said: "Yes, football.
"Good," he said. "You will be able to play football again better than ever."
My knee did not bend and the leg dropped straight from the knee to the ankle without a calf, and the machine was to bend the knee and make it move as in riding a tricycle.
But it did not bend yet, and instead the machine lurched when it came to the bending part.
The doctor said: "That will all pass.
You are a fortunate young man.
You will play football again like a champion.
In the next machine was a major who had a little hand like a baby's.
He winked at me when the doctor examined his hand, which was between two leather straps that bounced up and down and flapped the stiff fingers, and said: "And will I too play football, captain-doctor?" He had been a very great fencer, and before the war the greatest fencer in Italy.
The doctor went to his office in a back room and brought a photograph which showed a hand that had been withered almost as small as the major's, before it had taken a machine course, and after was a little larger.
The major held the photograph with his good hand and looked at it very carefully.
"A wound?" he asked.
"An industrial accident," the doctor said.
"Very interesting, very interesting," the major said, and handed it back to the doctor.
"You have confidence?"
"No," said the major.
There were three boys who came each day who were about the same age I was.
They were all three from Milan, and one of them was to be a lawyer, and one was to be a painter, and one had intended to be a soldier, and after we were finished with the machines, sometimes we walked back together to the Café Cova, which was next door to the Scala.
We walked the short way through the communist quarter because we were four together.
The people hated us because we were officers, and from a wine-shop some one would call out, "A basso gli ufficiali!" as we passed.
Another boy who walked with us sometimes and made us five wore a black silk handkerchief across his face because he had no nose then and his face was to be rebuilt.
He had gone out to the front from the military academy and been wounded within an hour after he had gone into the front line for the first time.
They rebuilt his face, but he came from a very old family and they could never get the nose exactly right.
He went to South America and worked in a bank.
But this was a long time ago, and then we did not any of us know how it was going to be afterward.
We only knew then that there was always the war, but that we were not going to it any more.
We all had the same medals, except the boy with the black silk bandage across his face, and he had not been at the front long enough to get any medals.
The tall boy with a very pale face who was to be a lawyer had been a lieutenant of Arditi and had three medals of the sort we each had only one of.
He had lived a very long time with death and was a little detached.
We were all a little detached, and there was nothing that held us together except that we met every afternoon at the hospital.
Although, as we walked to the Cova through the tough part of town, walking in the dark, with light and singing coming out of the wine-shops, and sometimes having to walk into the street when the men and women would crowd together on the sidewalk so that we would have had to jostle them to get by, we felt held together by there being something that had happened that they, the people who disliked us, did not understand.
We ourselves all understood the Cova, where it was rich and warm and not too brightly lighted, and noisy and smoky at certain hours, and there were always girls at the tables and the illustrated papers on a rack on the wall.
The girls at the Cova were very patriotic, and I found that the most patriotic people in Italy were the café girls--and I believe they are still patriotic.
The boys at first were very polite about my medals and asked me what I had done to get them.
I showed them the papers, which were written in very beautiful language and full of fratellanza and abnegazione, but which really said, with the adjectives removed, that I had been given the medals because I was an American.
After that their manner changed a little toward me, although I was their friend against outsiders.
I was a friend, but I was never really one of them after they had read the citations, because it had been different with them and they had done very different things to get their medals.
I had been wounded, it was true; but we all knew that being wounded, after all, was really an accident.
I was never ashamed of the ribbons, though, and sometimes, after the cocktail hour, I would imagine myself having done all the things they had done to get their medals; but walking home at night through the empty streets with the cold wind and all the shops closed, trying to keep near the street lights, I knew that I would never have done such things, and I was very much afraid to die, and often lay in bed at night by myself, afraid to die and wondering how I would be when I went back to the front again.
The three with the medals were like hunting-hawks; and I was not a hawk, although I might seem a hawk to those who had never hunted; they, the three, knew better and so we drifted apart.
But I stayed good friends with the boy who had been wounded his first day at the front, because he would never know now how he would have turned out; so he could never be accepted either, and I liked him because I thought perhaps he would not have turned out to be a hawk either.
The major, who had been the great fencer, did not believe in bravery, and spent much time while we sat in the machines correcting my grammar.
He had complimented me on how I spoke Italian, and we talked together very easily.
One day I had said that Italian seemed such an easy language to me that I could not take a great interest in it; everything was so easy to say.
"Ah, yes," the major said.
"Why, then, do you not take up the use of grammar?" So we took up the use of grammar, and soon Italian was such a difficult language that I was afraid to talk to him until I had the grammar straight in my mind.
The major came very regularly to the hospital.
I do not think he ever missed a day, although I am sure he did not believe in the machines.
There was a time when none of us believed in the machines, and one day the major said it was all nonsense.
The machines were new then and it was we who were to prove them.
It was an idiotic idea, he said, "a theory, like another.
" I had not learned my grammar, and he said I was a stupid impossible disgrace, and he was a fool to have bothered with me.
He was a small man and he sat straight up in his chair with his right hand thrust into the machine and looked straight ahead at the wall while the straps thumped up and down with his fingers in them.
"What will you do when the war is over if it is over?" he asked me. "Speak grammatically!"
"I will go to the States."
"Are you married?"
"No, but I hope to be."
"The more of a fool you are," he said. He seemed very angry. "A man must not marry."
"Why, Signor Maggiore?"
"Don't call me 'Signor Maggiore.'"
"Why must not a man marry?"
"He cannot marry. He cannot marry," he said angrily. "If he is to lose everything, he should not place himself in a position to lose that. He should not place himself in a position to lose. He should find things he cannot lose."
He spoke very angrily and bitterly, and looked straight ahead while he talked.
"But why should he necessarily lose it?"
"He'll lose it," the major said. He was looking at the wall. Then he looked down at the machine and jerked his little hand out from between the straps and slapped it hard against his thigh. "He'll lose it," he almost shouted. "Don't argue with me!" Then he called to the attendant who ran the machines. "Come and turn this damned thing off."
He went back into the other room for the light treatment and the massage.
Then I heard him ask the doctor if he might use his telephone and he shut the door.
When he came back into the room, I was sitting in another machine.
He was wearing his cape and had his cap on, and he came directly toward my machine and put his arm on my shoulder.
"I am so sorry," he said, and patted me on the shoulder with his good hand. "I would not be rude. My wife has just died. You must forgive me."
"Oh--" I said, feeling sick for him. "I am so sorry."
He stood there biting his lower lip.
"It is very difficult," he said.
"I cannot resign myself.
He looked straight past me and out through the window.
Then he began to cry.
"I am utterly unable to resign myself," he said and choked.
And then crying, his head up looking at nothing, carrying himself straight and soldierly, with tears on both his cheeks and biting his lips, he walked past the machines and out the door.
The doctor told me that the major's wife, who was very young and whom he had not married until he was definitely invalided out of the war, had died of pneumonia.
She had been sick only a few days.
No one expected her to die.
The major did not come to the hospital for three days.
Then he came at the usual hour, wearing a black band on the sleeve of his uniform.
When he came back, there were large framed photographs around the wall, of all sorts of wounds before and after they had been cured by the machines.
In front of the machine the major used were three photographs of hands like his that were completely restored.
I do not know where the doctor got them.
I always understood we were the first to use the machines.
The photographs did not make much difference to the major because he only looked out of the window.
Hills Like White Elephants.
The hills across the valley of the Ebro were long and white.
On this side there was no shade and no trees and the station was between two lines of rails in the sun.
Close against the side of the station there was the warm shadow of the building and a curtain, made of strings of bamboo beads, hung across the open door into the bar, to keep out flies.
The American and the girl with him sat at a table in the shade, outside the building.
It was very hot and the express from Barcelona would come in forty minutes.
It stopped at this junction for two minutes and went on to Madrid.
"What should we drink?" the girl asked. She had taken off her hat and put it on the table.
"It's pretty hot," the man said.
"Let's drink beer."
"Dos cervezas," the man said into the curtain.
"Big ones?" a woman asked from the doorway.
"Yes. Two big ones."
The woman brought two glasses of beer and two felt pads.
She put the felt pads and the beer glasses on the table and looked at the man and the girl.
The girl was looking off at the line of hills.
They were white in the sun and the country was brown and dry.
"They look like white elephants," she said.
"I've never seen one," the man drank his beer.
"No, you wouldn't have."
"I might have," the man said. "Just because you say I wouldn't have doesn't prove anything."
The girl looked at the bead curtain.
"They've painted something on it," she said.
"What does it say?".
"Anis del Toro. It's a drink."
"Could we try it?"
The man called "Listen" through the curtain.
The woman came out from the bar.
"Four reales."
"We want two Anis del Toro."
"With water?"
"Do you want it with water?"
"I don't know," the girl said. "Is it good with water?"
"It's all right."
"You want them with water?" asked the woman.
"Yes, with water."
"It tastes like licorice," the girl said and put the glass down.
"That's the way with everything."
"Yes," said the girl. "Everything tastes of licorice. Especially all the things you've waited so long for, like absinthe."
"Oh, cut it out."
"You started it," the girl said. "I was being amused. I was having a fine time."
"Well, let's try and have a fine time."
"All right. I was trying. I said the mountains looked like white elephants. Wasn't that bright?"
"That was bright."
"I wanted to try this new drink. That's all we do, isn't it--look at things and try new drinks?"
"I guess so."
The girl looked across at the hills.
"They're lovely hills," she said. "They don't really look like white elephants. I just meant the coloring of their skin through the trees."
"Should we have another drink?"
"All right."
The warm wind blew the bead curtain against the table.
"The beer's nice and cool," the man said.
"It's lovely," the girl said.
"It's really an awfully simple operation, Jig," the man said. "It's not really an operation at all."
The girl looked at the ground the table legs rested on.
"I know you wouldn't mind it, Jig. It's really not anything. It's just to let the air in."
The girl did not say anything.
"I'll go with you and I'll stay with you all the time. They just let the air in and then it's all perfectly natural."
"Then what will we do afterward?"
"We'll be fine afterward. Just like we were before."
"What makes you think so?"
"That's the only thing that bothers us. It's the only thing that's made us unhappy."
The girl looked at the bead curtain, put her hand out and took hold of two of the strings of beads.
"And you think then we'll be all right and be happy."
"I know we will. You don't have to be afraid. I've known lots of people that have done it."
"So have I," said the girl. "And afterward they were all so happy."
"Well," the man said, "if you don't want to you don't have to. I wouldn't have you do it if you didn't want to. But I know it's perfectly simple."
"And you really want to?"
"I think it's the best thing to do. But I don't want you to do it if you don't really want to."
"And if I do it you'll be happy and things will be like they were and you'll love me?"
"I love you now. You know I love you."
"I know. But if I do it, then it will be nice again if I say things are like white elephants, and you'll like it?"
"I'll love it. I love it now but I just can't think about it. You know how I get when I worry."
"If I do it you won't ever worry?"
"I won't worry about that because it's perfectly simple."
"Then I'll do it. Because I don't care about me."
"What do you mean?"
"I don't care about me."
"Well, I care about you."
"Oh, yes. But I don't care about me. And I'll do it and then everything will be fine."
"I don't want you to do it if you feel that way."
The girl stood up and walked to the end of the station.
Across, on the other side, were fields of grain and trees along the banks of the Ebro.
Far away, beyond the river, were mountains.
The shadow of a cloud moved across the field of grain and she saw the river through the trees.
"And we could have all this," she said. "And we could have everything and every day we make it more impossible."
"What did you say?"
"I said we could have everything."
"We can have everything."
"No, we can't."
"We can have the whole world."
"No, we can't."
"We can go everywhere."
"No, we can't. It isn't ours any more."
"It's ours."
"No, it isn't. And once they take it away, you never get it back."
"But they haven't taken it away."
"We'll wait and see."
"Come on back in the shade," he said. "You mustn't feel that way."
"I don't feel any way," the girl said. "I just know things."
"I don't want you to do anything that you don't want to do----"
"Nor that isn't good for me," she said. "I know. Could we have another beer?"
"All right. But you've got to realize----"
"I realize," the girl said. "Can't we maybe stop talking?"
They sat down at the table and the girl looked across at the hills on the dry side of the valley and the man looked at her and at the table.
"You've got to realize," he said, "that I don't want you to do it if you don't want to. I'm perfectly willing to go through with it if it means anything to you."
"Doesn't it mean anything to you? We could get along."
"Of course it does. But I don't want anybody but you. I don't want any one else. And I know it's perfectly simple."
"Yes, you know it's perfectly simple."
"It's all right for you to say that, but I do know it."
"Would you do something for me now?"
"I'd do anything for you."
"Would you please please please please please please please stop talking?"
He did not say anything but looked at the bags against the wall of the station.
There were labels on them from all the hotels where they had spent nights.
"But I don't want you to," he said, "I don't care anything about it."
"I'll scream," the girl said.
The woman came out through the curtains with two glasses of beer and put them down on the damp felt pads.
"The train comes in five minutes," she said.
"What did she say?" asked the girl.
"That the train is coming in five minutes."
The girl smiled brightly at the woman, to thank her.
"I'd better take the bags over to the other side of the station," the man said. She smiled at him.
"All right. Then come back and we'll finish the beer."
He picked up the two heavy bags and carried them around the station to the other tracks.
He looked up the tracks but could not see the train.
Coming back, he walked through the barroom, where people waiting for the train were drinking.
He drank an Anis at the bar and looked at the people.
They were all waiting reasonably for the train.
He went out through the bead curtain.
She was sitting at the table and smiled at him.
"Do you feel better?" he asked.
"I feel fine," she said. "There's nothing wrong with me. I feel fine."
The Killers.
The door of Henry's lunch-room opened and two men came in.
They sat down at the counter.
"What's yours?" George asked them.
"I don't know," one of the men said. "What do you want to eat, Al?"
"I don't know," said Al. "I don't know what I want to eat."
Outside it was getting dark.
The street-light came on outside the window.
The two men at the counter read the menu.
From the other end of the counter Nick Adams watched them.
He had been talking to George when they came in.
"I'll have a roast pork tenderloin with apple sauce and mashed potatoes," the first man said.
"It isn't ready yet."
"What the hell do you put it on the card for?"
"That's the dinner," George explained. "You can get that at six o'clock."
George looked at the clock on the wall behind the counter.
"It's five o'clock."
"The clock says twenty minutes past five," the second man said.
"It's twenty minutes fast."
"Oh, to hell with the clock," the first man said. "What have you got to eat?"
"I can give you any kind of sandwiches," George said. "You can have ham and eggs, bacon and eggs, liver and bacon, or a steak."
"Give me chicken croquettes with green peas and cream sauce and mashed potatoes."
"That's the dinner."
"Everything we want's the dinner, eh? That's the way you work it."
"I can give you ham and eggs, bacon and eggs, liver----"
"I'll take ham and eggs," the man called Al said. He wore a derby hat and a black overcoat buttoned across the chest. His face was small and white and he had tight lips. He wore a silk muffler and gloves.
"Give me bacon and eggs," said the other man. He was about the same size as Al. Their faces were different, but they were dressed like twins. Both wore overcoats too tight for them. They sat leaning forward, their elbows on the counter.
"Got anything to drink?" Al asked.
"Silver beer, bevo, ginger-ale," George said.
"I mean you got anything to drink?"
"Just those I said."
"This is a hot town," said the other. "What do they call it?"
"Summit."
"Ever hear of it?" Al asked his friend.
"No," said the friend.
"What do you do here nights?" Al asked.
"They eat the dinner," his friend said. "They all come here and eat the big dinner."
"That's right," George said.
"So you think that's right?" Al asked George.
"Sure."
"You're a pretty bright boy, aren't you?"
"Sure," said George.
"Well, you're not," said the other little man. "Is he, Al?"
"He's dumb," said Al. He turned to Nick. "What's your name?"
"Adams."
"Another bright boy," Al said. "Ain't he a bright boy, Max?"
"The town's full of bright boys," Max said.
George put the two platters, one of ham and eggs, the other of bacon and eggs, on the counter.
He set down two side-dishes of fried potatoes and closed the wicket into the kitchen.
"Which is yours?" he asked Al.
"Don't you remember?"
"Ham and eggs."
"Just a bright boy," Max said. He leaned forward and took the ham and eggs. Both men ate with their gloves on. George watched them eat.
"What are you looking at?" Max looked at George.
"Nothing."
"The hell you were. You were looking at me."
"Maybe the boy meant it for a joke, Max," Al said.
George laughed.
"You don't have to laugh," Max said to him. "You don't have to laugh at all, see?"
"All right," said George.
"So he thinks it's all right." Max turned to Al. "He thinks it's all right. That's a good one."
"Oh, he's a thinker," Al said. They went on eating.
"What's the bright boy's name down the counter?" Al asked Max.
"Hey, bright boy," Max said to Nick. "You go around on the other side of the counter with your boy friend."
"What's the idea?" Nick asked.
"There isn't any idea."
"You better go around, bright boy," Al said. Nick went around behind the counter.
"What's the idea?" George asked.
"None of your damn business," Al said. "Who's out in the kitchen?"
"The nigger."
"What do you mean the nigger?"
"The nigger that cooks."
"Tell him to come in."
"What's the idea?"
"Tell him to come in."
"Where do you think you are?"
"We know damn well where we are," the man called Max said. "Do we look silly?"
"You talk silly," Al said to him. "What the hell do you argue with this kid for? Listen," he said to George, "tell the nigger to come out here."
"What are you going to do to him?"
"Nothing. Use your head, bright boy. What would we do to a nigger?"
George opened the slit that opened back into the kitchen.
"Sam," he called.
"Come in here a minute.
The door to the kitchen opened and the nigger came in.
"What was it?" he asked.
The two men at the counter took a look at him.
"All right, nigger. You stand right there," Al said.
Sam, the nigger, standing in his apron, looked at the two men sitting at the counter.
"Yes, sir," he said.
Al got down from his stool.
"I'm going back to the kitchen with the nigger and bright boy," he said. "Go on back to the kitchen, nigger. You go with him, bright boy." The little man walked after Nick and Sam, the cook, back into the kitchen. The door shut after them. The man called Max sat at the counter opposite George. He didn't look at George but looked in the mirror that ran along back of the counter. Henry's had been made over from a saloon into a lunch-counter.
"Well, bright boy," Max said, looking into the mirror, "why don't you say something?"
"What's it all about?"
"Hey, Al," Max called, "bright boy wants to know what it's all about."
"Why don't you tell him?" Al's voice came from the kitchen.
"What do you think it's all about?"
"I don't know."
"What do you think?"
Max looked into the mirror all the time he was talking.
"I wouldn't say."
"Hey, Al, bright boy says he wouldn't say what he thinks it's all about."
"I can hear you, all right," Al said from the kitchen. He had propped open the slit that dishes passed through into the kitchen with a catsup bottle. "Listen, bright boy," he said from the kitchen to George. "Stand a little further along the bar. You move a little to the left, Max." He was like a photographer arranging for a group picture.
"Talk to me, bright boy," Max said. "What do you think's going to happen?"
George did not say anything.
"I'll tell you," Max said. "We're going to kill a Swede. Do you know a big Swede named Ole Andreson?"
"Yes."
"He comes here to eat every night, don't he?"
"Sometimes he comes here."
"He comes here at six o'clock, don't he?"
"If he comes."
"We know all that, bright boy," Max said. "Talk about something else. Ever go to the movies?"
"Once in a while."
"You ought to go to the movies more. The movies are fine for a bright boy like you."
"What are you going to kill Ole Andreson for? What did he ever do to you?"
"He never had a chance to do anything to us. He never even seen us."
"And he's only going to see us once," Al said from the kitchen.
"What are you going to kill him for, then?" George asked.
"We're killing him for a friend. Just to oblige a friend, bright boy."
"Shut up," said Al from the kitchen. "You talk too goddam much."
"Well, I got to keep bright boy amused. Don't I, bright boy?"
"You talk too damn much," Al said. "The nigger and my bright boy are amused by themselves. I got them tied up like a couple of girl friends in the convent."
"I suppose you were in a convent."
"You never know."
"You were in a kosher convent. That's where you were."
George looked up at the clock.
"If anybody comes in you tell them the cook is off, and if they keep after it, you tell them you'll go back and cook yourself. Do you get that, bright boy?"
"All right," George said. "What you going to do with us afterward?"
"That'll depend," Max said. "That's one of those things you never know at the time."
George looked up at the clock.
It was a quarter past six.
The door from the street opened.
A street-car motorman came in.
"Hello, George," he said. "Can I get supper?"
"Sam's gone out," George said. "He'll be back in about half an hour."
"I'd better go up the street," the motorman said. George looked at the clock. It was twenty minutes past six.
"That was nice, bright boy," Max said. "You're a regular little gentleman."
"He knew I'd blow his head off," Al said from the kitchen.
"No," said Max. "It ain't that. Bright boy is nice. He's a nice boy. I like him."
At six-fifty-five George said: "He's not coming.
Two other people had been in the lunch-room.
Once George had gone out to the kitchen and made a ham-and-egg sandwich "to go" that a man wanted to take with him.
Inside the kitchen he saw Al, his derby hat tipped back, sitting on a stool beside the wicket with the muzzle of a sawed-off shotgun resting on the ledge.
Nick and the cook were back to back in the corner, a towel tied in each of their mouths.
George had cooked the sandwich, wrapped it up in oiled paper, put it in a bag, brought it in, and the man had paid for it and gone out.
"Bright boy can do everything," Max said. "He can cook and everything. You'd make some girl a nice wife, bright boy."
"Yes?" George said. "Your friend, Ole Andreson, isn't going to come."
"We'll give him ten minutes," Max said.
Max watched the mirror and the clock.
The hands of the clock marked seven o'clock, and then five minutes past seven.
"Come on, Al," said Max. "We better go. He's not coming."
"Better give him five minutes," Al said from the kitchen.
In the five minutes a man came in, and George explained that the cook was sick.
"Why the hell don't you get another cook?" the man asked. "Aren't you running a lunch-counter?" He went out.
"Come on, Al," Max said.
"What about the two bright boys and the nigger?"
"They're all right."
"You think so?"
"Sure. We're through with it."
"I don't like it," said Al. "It's sloppy. You talk too much."
"Oh, what the hell," said Max. "We got to keep amused, haven't we?"
"You talk too much, all the same," Al said. He came out from the kitchen. The cut-off barrels of the shotgun made a slight bulge under the waist of his too tight-fitting overcoat. He straightened his coat with his gloved hands.
"So long, bright boy," he said to George. "You got a lot of luck."
"That's the truth," Max said. "You ought to play the races, bright boy."
The two of them went out the door.
George watched them, through the window, pass under the arc-light and cross the street.
In their tight overcoats and derby hats they looked like a vaudeville team.
George went back through the swinging-door into the kitchen and untied Nick and the cook.
"I don't want any more of that," said Sam, the cook. "I don't want any more of that."
Nick stood up.
He had never had a towel in his mouth before.
"Say," he said. "What the hell?" He was trying to swagger it off.
"They were going to kill Ole Andreson," George said. "They were going to shoot him when he came in to eat."
"Ole Andreson?"
"Sure."
The cook felt the corners of his mouth with his thumbs.
"They all gone?" he asked.
"Yeah," said George. "They're gone now."
"I don't like it," said the cook. "I don't like any of it at all."
"Listen," George said to Nick. "You better go see Ole Andreson."
"All right."
"You better not have anything to do with it at all," Sam, the cook, said. "You better stay way out of it."
"Don't go if you don't want to," George said.
"Mixing up in this ain't going to get you anywhere," the cook said. "You stay out of it."
"I'll go see him," Nick said to George. "Where does he live?"
The cook turned away.
"Little boys always know what they want to do," he said.
"He lives up at Hirsch's rooming-house," George said to Nick.
"I'll go up there."
Outside the arc-light shone through the bare branches of a tree.
Nick walked up the street beside the car-tracks and turned at the next arc-light down a side-street.
Three houses up the street was Hirsch's rooming-house.
Nick walked up the two steps and pushed the bell.
A woman came to the door.
"Is Ole Andreson here?"
"Do you want to see him?"
"Yes, if he's in."
Nick followed the woman up a flight of stairs and back to the end of a corridor.
She knocked on the door.
"Who is it?"
"It's somebody to see you, Mr. Andreson," the woman said.
"It's Nick Adams."
"Come in."
Nick opened the door and went into the room.
Ole Andreson was lying on the bed with all his clothes on.
He had been a heavyweight prizefighter and he was too long for the bed.
He lay with his head on two pillows.
He did not look at Nick.
"What was it?" he asked.
"I was up at Henry's," Nick said, "and two fellows came in and tied up me and the cook, and they said they were going to kill you."
It sounded silly when he said it.
Ole Andreson said nothing.
"They put us out in the kitchen," Nick went on. "They were going to shoot you when you came in to supper."
Ole Andreson looked at the wall and did not say anything.
"George thought I better come and tell you about it."
"There isn't anything I can do about it," Ole Andreson said.
"I'll tell you what they were like."
"I don't want to know what they were like," Ole Andreson said. He looked at the wall. "Thanks for coming to tell me about it."
"That's all right."
Nick looked at the big man lying on the bed.
"Don't you want me to go and see the police?"
"No," Ole Andreson said. "That wouldn't do any good."
"Isn't there something I could do?"
"No. There ain't anything to do."
"Maybe it was just a bluff."
"No. It ain't just a bluff."
Ole Andreson rolled over toward the wall.
"The only thing is," he said, talking toward the wall, "I just can't make up my mind to go out. I been in here all day."
"Couldn't you get out of town?"
"No," Ole Andreson said. "I'm through with all that running around."
He looked at the wall.
"There ain't anything to do now."
"Couldn't you fix it up some way?"
"No. I got in wrong." He talked in the same flat voice. "There ain't anything to do. After a while I'll make up my mind to go out."
"I better go back and see George," Nick said.
"So long," said Ole Andreson. He did not look toward Nick. "Thanks for coming around."
Nick went out.
As he shut the door he saw Ole Andreson with all his clothes on, lying on the bed looking at the wall.
"He's been in his room all day," the landlady said downstairs. "I guess he don't feel well. I said to him: 'Mr. Andreson, you ought to go out and take a walk on a nice fall day like this,' but he didn't feel like it."
"He doesn't want to go out."
"I'm sorry he don't feel well," the woman said. "He's an awfully nice man. He was in the ring, you know."
"I know it."
"You'd never know it except from the way his face is," the woman said. They stood talking just inside the street door. "He's just as gentle."
"Well, good-night, Mrs. Hirsch," Nick said.
"I'm not Mrs. Hirsch," the woman said. "She owns the place. I just look after it for her. I'm Mrs. Bell."
"Well, good-night, Mrs. Bell," Nick said.
"Good-night," the woman said.
Nick walked up the dark street to the corner under the arc-light, and then along the car-tracks to Henry's eating-house.
George was inside, back of the counter.
"Did you see Ole?"
"Yes," said Nick. "He's in his room and he won't go out."
The cook opened the door from the kitchen when he heard Nick's voice.
"I don't even listen to it," he said and shut the door.
"Did you tell him about it?" George asked.
"Sure. I told him but he knows what it's all about."
"What's he going to do?"
"Nothing."
"They'll kill him."
"I guess they will."
"He must have got mixed up in something in Chicago."
"I guess so," said Nick.
"It's a hell of a thing."
"It's an awful thing," Nick said.
They did not say anything.
George reached down for a towel and wiped the counter.
"I wonder what he did?" Nick said.
"Double-crossed somebody. That's what they kill them for."
"I'm going to get out of this town," Nick said.
"Yes," said George. "That's a good thing to do."
"I can't stand to think about him waiting in the room and knowing he's going to get it. It's too damned awful."
"Well," said George, "you better not think about it."
Che Ti Dice La Patria?.
The road of the pass was hard and smooth and not yet dusty in the early morning.
Below were the hills with oak and chestnut trees, and far away below was the sea.
On the other side were snowy mountains.
We came down from the pass through wooded country.
There were bags of charcoal piled beside the road, and through the trees we saw charcoal-burners' huts.
It was Sunday and the road, rising and falling, but always dropping away from the altitude of the pass, went through the scrub woods and through villages.
Outside the villages there were fields with vines.
The fields were brown and the vines coarse and thick.
The houses were white, and in the streets the men, in their Sunday clothes, were playing bowls.
Against the walls of some of the houses there were pear trees, their branches candelabraed against the white walls.
The pear trees had been sprayed, and the walls of the houses were stained a metallic blue-green by the spray vapor.
There were small clearings around the villages where the vines grew, and then the woods.
In a village, twenty kilometres above Spezia, there was a crowd in the square, and a young man carrying a suitcase came up to the car and asked us to take him in to Spezia.
"There are only two places, and they are occupied," I said. We had an old Ford coupé.
"I will ride on the outside."
"You will be uncomfortable."
"That makes nothing. I must go to Spezia."
"Should we take him?" I asked Guy.
"He seems to be going anyway," Guy said. The young man handed in a parcel through the window.
"Look after this," he said. Two men tied his suitcase on the back of the car, above our suitcases. He shook hands with every one, explained that to a Fascist and a man as used to travelling as himself there was no discomfort, and climbed up on the running-board on the left-hand side of the car, holding on inside, his right arm through the open window.
"You can start," he said. The crowd waved. He waved with his free hand.
"What did he say?" Guy asked me.
"That we could start."
"Isn't he nice?" Guy said.
The road followed a river.
Across the river were mountains.
The sun was taking the frost out of the grass.
It was bright and cold and the air came cold through the open wind-shield.
"How do you think he likes it out there?" Guy was looking up the road. His view out of his side of the car was blocked by our guest. The young man projected from the side of the car like the figurehead of a ship. He had turned his coat collar up and pulled his hat down and his nose looked cold in the wind.
"Maybe he'll get enough of it," Guy said. "That's the side our bum tire's on."
"Oh, he'd leave us if we blew out," I said. "He wouldn't get his travelling-clothes dirty."
"Well, I don't mind him," Guy said--"except the way he leans out on the turns."
The woods were gone; the road had left the river to climb; the radiator was boiling; the young man looked annoyedly and suspiciously at the steam and rusty water; the engine was grinding, with both Guy's feet on the first-speed pedal, up and up, back and forth and up, and, finally, out level.
The grinding stopped, and in the new quiet there was a great churning bubbling in the radiator.
We were at the top of the last range above Spezia and the sea.
The road descended with short, barely rounded turns.
Our guest hung out on the turns and nearly pulled the top-heavy car over.
"You can't tell him not to," I said to Guy. "It's his sense of self-preservation."
"The great Italian sense."
"The greatest Italian sense."
We came down around curves, through deep dust, the dust powdering the olive trees.
Spezia spread below along the sea.
The road flattened outside the town.
Our guest put his head in the window.
"I want to stop."
"Stop it," I said to Guy.
We slowed up, at the side of the road.
The young man got down, went to the back of the car and untied the suitcase.
"I stop here, so you won't get into trouble carrying passengers," he said. "My package."
I handed him the package.
He reached in his pocket.
"How much do I owe you?"
"Nothing."
"Why not?"
"I don't know," I said.
"Then thanks," the young man said, not "thank you," or "thank you very much," or "thank you a thousand times," all of which you formerly said in Italy to a man when he handed you a time-table or explained about a direction. The young man uttered the lowest form of the word "thanks" and looked after us suspiciously as Guy started the car. I waved my hand at him. He was too dignified to reply. We went on into Spezia.
"That's a young man that will go a long way in Italy," I said to Guy.
"Well," said Guy, "he went twenty kilometres with us."
A MEAL IN SPEZIA.
We came into Spezia looking for a place to eat.
The street was wide and the houses high and yellow.
We followed the tram-track into the centre of town.
On the walls of the houses were stencilled eye-bugging portraits of Mussolini, with hand-painted "vivas," the double V in black paint with drippings of paint down the wall.
Side-streets went down to the harbor.
It was bright and the people were all out for Sunday.
The stone paving had been sprinkled and there were damp stretches in the dust.
We went close to the curb to avoid a tram.
"Let's eat somewhere simple," Guy said.
We stopped opposite two restaurant signs.
We were standing across the street and I was buying the papers.
The two restaurants were side by side.
A woman standing in the doorway of one smiled at us and we crossed the street and went in.
It was dark inside and at the back of the room three girls were sitting at a table with an old woman.
Across from us, at another table, sat a sailor.
He sat there neither eating nor drinking.
Further back, a young man in a blue suit was writing at a table.
His hair was pomaded and shining and he was very smartly dressed and clean-cut looking.
The light came through the doorway, and through the window where vegetables, fruit, steaks, and chops were arranged in a show-case.
A girl came and took our order and another girl stood in the doorway.
We noticed that she wore nothing under her house dress.
The girl who took our order put her arm around Guy's neck while we were looking at the menu.
There were three girls in all, and they all took turns going and standing in the doorway.
The old woman at the table in the back of the room spoke to them and they sat down again with her.
There was no doorway leading from the room except into the kitchen.
A curtain hung over it.
The girl who had taken our order came in from the kitchen with spaghetti.
She put it on the table and brought a bottle of red wine and sat down at the table.
"Well," I said to Guy, "you wanted to eat some place simple."
"This isn't simple. This is complicated."
"What do you say?" asked the girl. "Are you Germans?"
"South Germans," I said. "The South Germans are a gentle, lovable people."
"Don't understand," she said.
"What's the mechanics of this place?" Guy asked. "Do I have to let her put her arm around my neck?"
"Certainly," I said. "Mussolini has abolished the brothels. This is a restaurant."
The girl wore a one-piece dress.
She leaned forward against the table and put her hands on her breasts and smiled.
She smiled better on one side than on the other and turned the good side toward us.
The charm of the good side had been enhanced by some event which had smoothed the other side of her nose in, as warm wax can be smoothed.
Her nose, however, did not look like warm wax.
It was very cold and firmed, only smoothed in.
"You like me?" she asked Guy.
"He adores you," I said. "But he doesn't speak Italian."
"Ich spreche Deutsch," she said, and stroked Guy's hair.
"Speak to the lady in your native tongue, Guy."
"Where do you come from?" asked the lady.
"Potsdam."
"And you will stay here now for a little while?"
"In this so dear Spezia?" I asked.
"Tell her we have to go," said Guy. "Tell her we are very ill, and have no money."
"My friend is a misogynist," I said, "an old German misogynist."
"Tell him I love him."
I told him.
"Will you shut your mouth and get us out of here?" Guy said. The lady had placed another arm around his neck. "Tell him he is mine," she said. I told him.
"Will you get us out of here?"
"You are quarrelling," the lady said. "You do not love one another."
"We are Germans," I said proudly, "old South Germans."
"Tell him he is a beautiful boy," the lady said. Guy is thirty-eight and takes some pride in the fact that he is taken for a travelling salesman in France. "You are a beautiful boy," I said.
"Who says so?" Guy asked, "you or her?"
"She does. I'm just your interpreter. Isn't that what you got me in on this trip for?"
"I'm glad it's her," said Guy. "I didn't want to have to leave you here too."
"I don't know. Spezia's a lovely place."
"Spezia," the lady said. "You are talking about Spezia."
"Lovely place," I said.
"It is my country," she said. "Spezia is my home and Italy is my country."
"She says that Italy is her country."
"Tell her it looks like her country," Guy said.
"What have you for dessert?" I asked.
"Fruit," she said. "We have bananas."
"Bananas are all right," Guy said. "They've got skins on."
"Oh, he takes bananas," the lady said. She embraced Guy.
"What does she say?" he asked, keeping his face out of the way.
"She is pleased because you take bananas."
"Tell her I don't take bananas."
"The Signor does not take bananas."
"Ah," said the lady, crestfallen, "he doesn't take bananas."
"Tell her I take a cold bath every morning," Guy said.
"The Signor takes a cold bath every morning."
"No understand," the lady said.
Across from us, the property sailor had not moved.
No one in the place paid any attention to him.
"We want the bill," I said.
"Oh, no. You must stay."
"Listen," the clean-cut young man said from the table where he was writing, "let them go. These two are worth nothing."
The lady took my hand.
"You won't stay? You won't ask him to stay?".
"We have to go," I said. "We have to get to Pisa, or if possible, Firenze, to-night. We can amuse ourselves in those cities at the end of the day. It is now the day. In the day we must cover distance."
"To stay a little while is nice."
"To travel is necessary during the light of day."
"Listen," the clean-cut young man said. "Don't bother to talk with these two. I tell you they are worth nothing and I know."
"Bring us the bill," I said. She brought the bill from the old woman and went back and sat at the table. Another girl came in from the kitchen. She walked the length of the room and stood in the doorway.
"Don't bother with these two," the clean-cut young man said in a wearied voice. "Come and eat. They are worth nothing."
We paid the bill and stood up.
All the girls, the old woman, and the clean-cut young man sat down at table together.
The property sailor sat with his head in his hands.
No one had spoken to him all the time we were at lunch.
The girl brought us our change that the old woman counted out for her and went back to her place at the table.
We left a tip on the table and went out.
When we were seated in the car ready to start, the girl came out and stood in the door.
We started and I waved to her.
She did not wave, but stood there looking after us.
AFTER THE RAIN.
It was raining hard when we passed through the suburbs of Genoa and, even going very slowly behind the tram-cars and the motor trucks, liquid mud splashed on to the sidewalks, so that people stepped into doorways as they saw us coming.
In San Pier d'Arena, the industrial suburb outside of Genoa, there is a wide street with two car-tracks and we drove down the centre to avoid sending the mud on to the men going home from work.
On our left was the Mediterranean.
There was a big sea running and waves broke and the wind blew the spray against the car.
A river-bed that, when we had passed, going into Italy, had been wide, stony and dry, was running brown, and up to the banks.
The brown water discolored the sea and as the waves thinned and cleared in breaking, the light came through the yellow water and the crests, detached by the wind, blew across the road.
A big car passed us, going fast, and a sheet of muddy water rose up and over our wind-shield and radiator.
The automatic wind-shield cleaner moved back and forth, spreading the film over the glass.
We stopped and ate lunch at Sestri.
There was no heat in the restaurant and we kept our hats and coats on.
We could see the car outside, through the window.
It was covered with mud and was stopped beside some boats that had been pulled up beyond the waves.
In the restaurant you could see your breath.
The pasta asciuta was good; the wine tasted of alum, and we poured water in it.
Afterward the waiter brought beefsteak and fried potatoes.
A man and a woman sat at the far end of the restaurant.
He was middle-aged and she was young and wore black.
All during the meal she would blow out her breath in the cold damp air.
The man would look at it and shake his head.
They ate without talking and the man held her hand under the table.
She was good-looking and they seemed very sad.
They had a travelling-bag with them.
We had the papers and I read the account of the Shanghai fighting aloud to Guy.
After the meal, he left with the waiter in search for a place which did not exist in the restaurant, and I cleaned off the wind-shield, the lights and the license plates with a rag.
Guy came back and we backed the car out and started.
The waiter had taken him across the road and into an old house.
The people in the house were suspicious and the waiter had remained with Guy to see nothing was stolen.
"Although I don't know how, me not being a plumber, they expected me to steal anything," Guy said.
As we came up on a headland beyond the town, the wind struck the car and nearly tipped it over.
"It's good it blows us away from the sea," Guy said.
"Well," I said, "they drowned Shelley somewhere along here."
"That was down by Viareggio," Guy said. "Do you remember what we came to this country for?"
"Yes," I said, "but we didn't get it."
"We'll be out of it to-night."
"If we can get past Ventimiglia."
"We'll see. I don't like to drive this coast at night." It was early afternoon and the sun was out. Below, the sea was blue with whitecaps running toward Savona. Back, beyond the cape, the brown and blue waters joined. Out ahead of us, a tramp steamer was going up the coast.
"Can you still see Genoa?" Guy asked.
"Oh, yes."
"That next big cape ought to put it out of sight."
"We'll see it a long time yet. I can still see Portofino Cape behind it."
Finally we could not see Genoa.
I looked back as we came out and there was only the sea, and below in the bay, a line of beach with fishing-boats and above, on the side of the hill, a town and then capes far down the coast.
"It's gone now," I said to Guy.
"Oh, it's been gone a long time now."
"But we couldn't be sure till we got way out."
There was a sign with a picture of an S-turn and Svolta Pericolosa.
The road curved around the headland and the wind blew through the crack in the wind-shield.
Below the cape was a flat stretch beside the sea.
The wind had dried the mud and the wheels were beginning to lift dust.
On the flat road we passed a Fascist riding a bicycle, a heavy revolver in a holster on his back.
He held the middle of the road on his bicycle and we turned out for him.
He looked up at us as we passed.
Ahead there was a railway crossing, and as we came toward it the gates went down.
As we waited, the Fascist came up on his bicycle.
The train went by and Guy started the engine.
"Wait," the bicycle man shouted from behind the car. "Your number's dirty."
I got out with a rag.
The number had been cleaned at lunch.
"You can read it," I said.
"You think so?"
"Read it."
"I cannot read it. It is dirty."
I wiped it off with the rag.
"How's that?"
"Twenty-five lire."
"What?" I said. "You could have read it. It's only dirty from the state of the roads."
"You don't like Italian roads?"
"They are dirty."
"Fifty lire." He spat in the road. "Your car is dirty and you are dirty too."
"Good. And give me a receipt with your name."
He took out a receipt-book, made in duplicate, and perforated, so one side could be given to the customer, and the other side filled in and kept as a stub.
There was no carbon to record what the customer's ticket said.
"Give me fifty lire."
He wrote in indelible pencil, tore out the slip and handed it to me.
I read it.
"This is for twenty-five lire."
"A mistake," he said, and changed the twenty-five to fifty.
"And now the other side. Make it fifty in the part you keep."
He smiled a beautiful Italian smile and wrote something on the receipt stub, holding it so I could not see.
"Go on," he said, "before your number gets dirty again."
We drove for two hours after it was dark and slept in Mentone that night.
It seemed very cheerful and clean and sane and lovely.
We had driven from Ventimiglia to Pisa and Florence, across the Romagna to Rimini, back through Forli, Imola, Bologna, Parma, Piacenza and Genoa, to Ventimiglia again.
The whole trip had only taken ten days.
Naturally, in such a short trip, we had no opportunity to see how things were with the country or the people.
Fifty Grand.
"How are you going yourself, Jack?" I asked him.
"You seen this, Walcott?" he says.
"Just in the gym."
"Well," Jack says, "I'm going to need a lot of luck with that boy."
"He can't hit you, Jack," Soldier said.
"I wish to hell he couldn't."
"He couldn't hit you with a handful of bird-shot."
"Bird-shot'd be all right," Jack says. "I wouldn't mind bird-shot any."
"He looks easy to hit," I said.
"Sure," Jack says, "he ain't going to last long. He ain't going to last like you and me, Jerry. But right now he's got everything."
"You'll left-hand him to death."
"Maybe," Jack says. "Sure. I got a chance to."
"Handle him like you handled Kid Lewis."
"Kid Lewis," Jack said. "That kike!"
The three of us, Jack Brennan, Soldier Bartlett, and I were in Handley's.
There were a couple of broads sitting at the next table to us.
They had been drinking.
"What do you mean, kike?" one of the broads says. "What do you mean, kike, you big Irish bum?"
"Sure," Jack says. "That's it."
"Kikes," this broad goes on. "They're always talking about kikes, these big Irishmen. What do you mean, kikes?"
"Come on. Let's get out of here."
"Kikes," this broad goes on. "Whoever saw you ever buy a drink? Your wife sews your pockets up every morning. These Irishmen and their kikes! Ted Lewis could lick you too."
"Sure," Jack says. "And you give away a lot of things free too, don't you?"
We went out.
That was Jack.
He could say what he wanted to when he wanted to say it.
Jack started training out at Danny Hogan's health-farm over in Jersey.
It was nice out there but Jack didn't like it much.
He didn't like being away from his wife and the kids, and he was sore and grouchy most of the time.
He liked me and we got along fine together; and he liked Hogan, but after a while Soldier Bartlett commenced to get on his nerves.
A kidder gets to be an awful thing around a camp if his stuff goes sort of sour.
Soldier was always kidding Jack, just sort of kidding him all the time.
It wasn't very funny and it wasn't very good, and it began to get to Jack.
It was sort of stuff like this.
Jack would finish up with the weights and the bag and pull on the gloves.
"You want to work?" he'd say to Soldier.
"Sure. How you want me to work?" Soldier would ask. "Want me to treat you rough like Walcott? Want me to knock you down a few times?"
"That's it," Jack would say. He didn't like it any, though.
One morning we were all out on the road.
We'd been out quite a way and now we were coming back.
We'd go along fast for three minutes and then walk a minute, and then go fast for three minutes again.
Jack wasn't ever what you would call a sprinter.
He'd move around fast enough in the ring if he had to, but he wasn't any too fast on the road.
All the time we were walking Soldier was kidding him.
We came up the hill to the farmhouse.
"Well," says Jack, "you better go back to town, Soldier."
"What do you mean?"
"You better go back to town and stay there."
"What's the matter?"
"I'm sick of hearing you talk."
"Yes?" says Soldier.
"Yes," says Jack.
"You'll be a damn sight sicker when Walcott gets through with you."
"Sure," says Jack, "maybe I will. But I know I'm sick of you."
So Soldier went off on the train to town that same morning.
I went down with him to the train.
He was good and sore.
"I was just kidding him," he said. We were waiting on the platform. "He can't pull that stuff with me, Jerry."
"He's nervous and crabby," I said. "He's a good fellow, Soldier."
"The hell he is. The hell he's ever been a good fellow."
"Well," I said, "so long, Soldier."
The train had come in.
He climbed up with his bag.
"So long, Jerry," he says. "You be in town before the fight?"
"I don't think so."
"See you then."
He went in and the conductor swung up and the train went out.
I rode back to the farm in the cart.
Jack was on the porch writing a letter to his wife.
The mail had come and I got the papers and went over on the other side of the porch and sat down to read.
Hogan came out the door and walked over to me.
"Did he have a jam with Soldier?"
"Not a jam," I said. "He just told him to go back to town."
"I could see it coming," Hogan said. "He never liked Soldier much."
"No. He don't like many people."
"He's a pretty cold one," Hogan said.
"Well, he's always been fine to me."
"Me too," Hogan said. "I got no kick on him. He's a cold one, though."
Hogan went in through the screen door and I sat there on the porch and read the papers.
It was just starting to get fall weather and it's nice country there in Jersey, up in the hills, and after I read the paper through I sat there and looked out at the country and the road down below against the woods with cars going along it, lifting the dust up.
It was fine weather and pretty nice-looking country.
Hogan came to the door and I said, "Say, Hogan, haven't you got anything to shoot out here?".
"No," Hogan said. "Only sparrows."
"Seen the paper?" I said to Hogan.
"What's in it?"
"Sande booted three of them in yesterday."
"I got that on the telephone last night."
"You follow them pretty close, Hogan?" I asked.
"Oh, I keep in touch with them," Hogan said.
"How about Jack?" I says. "Does he still play them?"
"Him?" said Hogan. "Can you see him doing it?"
Just then Jack came around the corner with the letter in his hand.
He's wearing a sweater and an old pair of pants and boxing shoes.
"Got a stamp, Hogan?" he asks.
"Give me the letter," Hogan said. "I'll mail it for you."
"Say, Jack," I said, "didn't you used to play the ponies?"
"Sure."
"I knew you did. I knew I used to see you out at Sheepshead."
"What did you lay off them for?" Hogan asked.
"Lost money."
Jack sat down on the porch by me.
He leaned back against a post.
He shut his eyes in the sun.
"Want a chair?" Hogan asked.
"No," said Jack. "This is fine."
"It's a nice day," I said. "It's pretty nice out in the country."
"I'd a damn sight rather be in town with the wife."
"Well, you only got another week."
"Yes," Jack says. "That's so."
We sat there on the porch.
Hogan was inside at the office.
"What do you think about the shape I'm in?" Jack asked me.
"Well, you can't tell," I said. "You got a week to get around into form."
"Don't stall me."
"Well," I said, "you're not right."
"I'm not sleeping," Jack said.
"You'll be all right in a couple of days."
"No," says Jack, "I got the insomnia."
"What's on your mind?"
"I miss the wife."
"Have her come out."
"No. I'm too old for that."
"We'll take a long walk before you turn in and get you good and tired."
"Tired!" Jack says. "I'm tired all the time."
He was that way all week.
He wouldn't sleep at night and he'd get up in the morning feeling that way, you know, when you can't shut your hands.
"He's stale as poorhouse cake," Hogan said. "He's nothing."
"I never seen Walcott," I said.
"He'll kill him," said Hogan. "He'll tear him in two."
"Well," I said, "everybody's got to get it sometime."
"Not like this, though," Hogan said. "They'll think he never trained. It gives the farm a black eye."
"You hear what the reporters said about him?"
"Didn't I! They said he was awful. They said they oughtn't to let him fight."
"Well," I said, "they're always wrong, ain't they?"
"Yes," said Hogan. "But this time they're right."
"What the hell do they know about whether a man's right or not?"
"Well," said Hogan, "they're not such fools."
"All they did was pick Willard at Toledo. This Lardner, he's so wise now, ask him about when he picked Willard at Toledo."
"Aw, he wasn't out," Hogan said. "He only writes the big fights."
"I don't care who they are," I said. "What the hell do they know? They can write maybe, but what the hell do they know?"
"You don't think Jack's in any shape, do you?" Hogan asked.
"No. He's through. All he needs is to have Corbett pick him to win for it to be all over."
"Well, Corbett'll pick him," Hogan says.
"Sure. He'll pick him."
That night Jack didn't sleep any either.
The next morning was the last day before the fight.
After breakfast we were out on the porch again.
"What do you think about, Jack, when you can't sleep?" I said.
"Oh, I worry," Jack says. "I worry about property I got up in the Bronx, I worry about property I got in Florida. I worry about the kids. I worry about the wife. Sometimes I think about fights. I think about that kike Ted Lewis and I get sore. I got some stocks and I worry about them. What the hell don't I think about?"
"Well," I said, "to-morrow night it'll all be over."
"Sure," said Jack. "That always helps a lot, don't it? That just fixes everything all up, I suppose. Sure."
He was sore all day.
We didn't do any work.
Jack just moved around a little to loosen up.
He shadow-boxed a few rounds.
He didn't even look good doing that.
He skipped the rope a little while.
He couldn't sweat.
"He'd be better not to do any work at all," Hogan said. We were standing watching him skip rope. "Don't he ever sweat at all any more?"
"He can't sweat."
"Do you suppose he's got the con? He never had any trouble making weight, did he?"
"No, he hasn't got any con. He just hasn't got anything inside any more."
"He ought to sweat," said Hogan.
Jack came over, skipping the rope.
He was skipping up and down in front of us, forward and back, crossing his arms every third time.
"Well," he says. "What are you buzzards talking about?"
"I don't think you ought to work any more," Hogan says. "You'll be stale."
"Wouldn't that be awful?" Jack says and skips away down the floor, slapping the rope hard.
That afternoon John Collins showed up out at the farm.
Jack was up in his room.
John, came out in a car from town.
He had a couple of friends with him.
The car stopped and they all got out.
"Where's Jack?" John asked me.
"Up in his room, lying down."
"Lying down?"
"Yes," I said.
"How is he?"
I looked at the two fellows that were with John.
"They're friends of his," John said.
"He's pretty bad," I said.
"What's the matter with him?"
"He don't sleep."
"Hell," said John. "That Irishman could never sleep."
"He isn't right," I said.
"Hell," John said. "He's never right. I've had him for ten years and he's never been right yet."
The fellows who were with him laughed.
"I want you to shake hands with Mr. Morgan and Mr. Steinfelt," John said. "This is Mr. Doyle. He's been training Jack."
"Glad to meet you," I said.
"Let's go up and see the boy," the fellow called Morgan said.
"Let's have a look at him," Steinfelt said.
We all went upstairs.
"Where's Hogan?" John asked.
"He's out in the barn with a couple of his customers," I said.
"He got many people out here now?" John asked.
"Just two."
"Pretty quiet, ain't it?" Morgan said.
"Yes," I said. "It's pretty quiet."
We were outside Jack's room.
John knocked on the door.
There wasn't any answer.
"Maybe he's asleep," I said.
"What the hell's he sleeping in the daytime for?"
John turned the handle and we all went in.
Jack was lying asleep on the bed.
He was face down and his face was in the pillow.
Both his arms were around the pillow.
"Hey, Jack!" John said to him.
Jack's head moved a little on the pillow.
"Jack!" John says, leaning over him.
Jack just dug a little deeper in the pillow.
John touched him on the shoulder.
Jack sat up and looked at us.
He hadn't shaved and he was wearing an old sweater.
"Christ! Why can't you let me sleep?" he says to John.
"Don't be sore," John says. "I didn't mean to wake you up."
"Oh no," Jack says. "Of course not."
"You know Morgan and Steinfelt," John said.
"Glad to see you," Jack says.
"How do you feel, Jack," Morgan asks him.
"Fine," Jack says. "How the hell would I feel?"
"You look fine," Steinfelt says.
"Yes, don't I," says Jack. "Say," he says to John. "You're my manager. You get a big enough cut. Why the hell don't you come out here when the reporters was out! You want Jerry and me to talk to them?"
"I had Lew fighting in Philadelphia," John said.
"What the hell's that to me?" Jack says. "You're my manager. You get a big enough cut, don't you? You aren't making me any money in Philadelphia, are you? Why the hell aren't you out here when I ought to have you?"
"Hogan was here."
"Hogan," Jack says. "Hogan's as dumb as I am."
"Soldier Bathlett was out here wukking with you for a while, wasn't he?" Steinfelt said to change the subject.
"Yes, he was out here," Jack says. "He was out here all right."
"Say, Jerry," John said to me. "Would you go and find Hogan and tell him we want to see him in about half an hour?"
"Sure," I said.
"Why the hell can't he stick around?" Jack says. "Stick around, Jerry."
Morgan and Steinfelt looked at each other.
"Quiet down, Jack," John said to him.
"I better go find Hogan," I said.
"All right, if you want to go," Jack says. "None of these guys are going to send you away, though."
"I'll go find Hogan," I said.
Hogan was out in the gym in the barn.
He had a couple of his health-farm patients with the gloves on.
They neither one wanted to hit the other, for fear the other would come back and hit him.
"That'll do," Hogan said when he saw me come in. "You can stop the slaughter. You gentlemen take a shower and Bruce will rub you down."
They climbed out through the ropes and Hogan came over to me.
"John Collins is out with a couple of friends to see Jack," I said.
"I saw them come up in the car."
"Who are the two fellows with John?"
"They're what you call wise boys," Hogan said. "Don't you know them two?"
"No," I said.
"That's Happy Steinfelt and Lew Morgan. They got a pool-room."
"I been away a long time," I said.
"Sure," said Hogan. "That Happy Steinfelt's a big operator."
"I've heard his name," I said.
"He's a pretty smooth boy," Hogan said. "They're a couple of sharpshooters."
"Well," I said. "They want to see us in half an hour."
"You mean they don't want to see us until a half an hour?"
"That's it."
"Come on in the office," Hogan said. "To hell with those sharpshooters."
After about thirty minutes or so Hogan and I went upstairs.
We knocked on Jack's door.
They were talking inside the room.
"Wait a minute," somebody said.
"To hell with that stuff," Hogan said. "When you want to see me I'm down in the office."
We heard the door unlock.
Steinfelt opened it.
"Come on in, Hogan," he says. "We're all going to have a drink."
"Well," says Hogan. "That's something."
We went in.
Jack was sitting on the bed.
John and Morgan were sitting on a couple of chairs.
Steinfelt was standing up.
"You're a pretty mysterious lot of boys," Hogan said.
"Hello, Danny," John says.
"Hello, Danny," Morgan says and shakes hands.
Jack doesn't say anything.
He just sits there on the bed.
He ain't with the others.
He's all by himself.
He was wearing an old blue jersey and pants and had on boxing shoes.
He needed a shave.
Steinfelt and Morgan were dressers.
John was quite a dresser too.
Jack sat there looking Irish and tough.
Steinfelt brought out a bottle and Hogan brought in some glasses and everybody had a drink.
Jack and I took one and the rest of them went on and had two or three each.
"Better save some for your ride back," Hogan said.
"Don't you worry. We got plenty," Morgan said.
Jack hadn't drunk anything since the one drink.
He was standing up and looking at them.
Morgan was sitting on the bed where Jack had sat.
"Have a drink, Jack," John said and handed him the glass and the bottle.
"No," Jack said, "I never liked to go to these wakes."
They all laughed.
Jack didn't laugh.
They were all feeling pretty good when they left.
Jack stood on the porch when they got into the car.
They waved to him.
"So long," Jack said.
We had supper.
Jack didn't say anything all during the meal except, "Will you pass me this?" or "Will you pass me that?" The two health-farm patients ate at the same table with us.
They were pretty nice fellows.
After we finished eating we went out on the porch.
It was dark early.
"Like to take a walk, Jerry?" Jack asked.
"Sure," I said.
We put on our coats and started out.
It was quite a way down to the main road and then we walked along the main road about a mile and a half.
Cars kept going by and we would pull out to the side until they were past.
Jack didn't say anything.
After we had stepped out into the bushes to let a big car go by Jack said, "To hell with this walking.
Come on back to Hogan's.
We went along a side road that cut up over the hill and cut across the fields back to Hogan's.
We could see the lights of the house up on the hill.
We came around to the front of the house and there standing in the doorway was Hogan.
"Have a good walk?" Hogan asked.
"Oh, fine," Jack said. "Listen, Hogan. Have you got any liquor?"
"Sure," says Hogan. "What's the idea?"
"Send it up to the room," Jack says. "I'm going to sleep to-night."
"You're the doctor," Hogan says.
"Come on up to the room, Jerry," Jack says.
Upstairs Jack sat on the bed with his head in his hands.
"Ain't it a life?" Jack says.
Hogan brought in a quart of liquor and two glasses.
"Want some ginger-ale?"
"What do you think I want to do, get sick?"
"I just asked you," said Hogan.
"Have a drink?" said Jack.
"No, thanks," said Hogan. He went out.
"How about you, Jerry?"
"I'll have one with you," I said.
Jack poured out a couple of drinks.
"Now," he said, "I want to take it slow and easy.
"Put some water in it," I said.
"Yes," Jack said. "I guess that's better."
We had a couple of drinks without saying anything.
Jack started to pour me another.
"No," I said, "that's all I want."
"All right," Jack said. He poured himself out another big shot and put water in it. He was lighting up a little.
"That was a fine bunch out here this afternoon," he said. "They don't take any chances, those two."
Then a little later, "Well," he says, "they're right.
What the hell's the good in taking chances?".
"Don't you want another, Jerry?" he said. "Come on, drink along with me."
"I don't need it, Jack," I said. "I feel all right."
"Just have one more," Jack said. It was softening him up.
"All right," I said.
Jack poured one for me and another big one for himself.
"You know," he said, "I like liquor pretty well. If I hadn't been boxing I would have drunk quite a lot."
"Sure," I said.
"You know," he said, "I missed a lot, boxing."
"You made plenty of money."
"Sure, that's what I'm after. You know I miss a lot, Jerry."
"How do you mean?"
"Well," he says, "like about the wife. And being away from home so much. It don't do my girls any good. 'Whose your old man?' some of those society kids'll say to them. 'My old man's Jack Brennan.' That don't do them any good."
"Hell," I said, "all that makes a difference is if they got dough."
"Well," says Jack, "I got the dough for them all right."
He poured out another drink.
The bottle was about empty.
"Put some water in it," I said. Jack poured in some water.
"You know," he says, "you ain't got any idea how I miss the wife."
"Sure."
"You ain't got any idea. You can't have an idea what it's like."
"It ought to be better out in the country than in town."
"With me now," Jack said, "it don't make any difference where I am. You can't have an idea what it's like."
"Have another drink."
"Am I getting soused? Do I talk funny?"
"You're coming on all right."
"You can't have an idea what it's like. They ain't anybody can have an idea what it's like."
"Except the wife," I said.
"She knows," Jack said. "She knows all right. She knows. You bet she knows."
"Put some water in that," I said.
"Jerry," says Jack, "you can't have an idea what it gets to be like."
He was good and drunk.
He was looking at me steady.
His eyes were sort of too steady.
"You'll sleep all right," I said.
"Listen, Jerry," Jack says. "You want to make some money? Get some money down on Walcott."
"Yes?"
"Listen, Jerry," Jack put down the glass. "I'm not drunk now, see? You know what I'm betting on him? Fifty grand."
"That's a lot of dough."
"Fifty grand," Jack says, "at two to one. I'll get twenty-five thousand bucks. Get some money on him, Jerry."
"It sounds good," I said.
"How can I beat him?" Jack says. "It ain't crooked. How can I beat him? Why not make money on it?"
"Put some water in that," I said.
"I'm through after this fight," Jack says. "I'm through with it. I got to take a beating. Why shouldn't I make money on it?"
"Sure."
"I ain't slept for a week," Jack says. "All night I lay awake and worry my can off. I can't sleep, Jerry. You ain't got an idea what it's like when you can't sleep."
"Sure."
"I can't sleep. That's all. I just can't sleep. What's the use of taking care of yourself all these years when you can't sleep?"
"It's bad."
"You ain't got an idea what it's like, Jerry, when you can't sleep."
"Put some water in that," I said.
Well, about eleven o'clock Jack passes out and I put him to bed.
Finally he's so he can't keep from sleeping.
I helped him get his clothes off and got him into bed.
"You'll sleep all right, Jack," I said.
"Sure," Jack says, "I'll sleep now."
"Good-night, Jack," I said.
"Good-night, Jerry," Jack says. "You're the only friend I got."
"Oh, hell," I said.
"You're the only friend I got," Jack says, "the only friend I got."
"Go to sleep," I said.
"I'll sleep," Jack says.
Downstairs Hogan was sitting at the desk in the office reading the papers.
He looked up.
"Well, you get your boy friend to sleep?" he asks.
"He's off."
"It's better for him than not sleeping," Hogan said.
"Sure."
"You'd have a hell of a time explaining that to these sport writers though," Hogan said.
"Well, I'm going to bed myself," I said.
"Good-night," said Hogan.
In the morning I came downstairs about eight o'clock and got some breakfast.
Hogan had his two customers out in the barn doing exercises.
I went out and watched them.
"One! Two! Three! Four!" Hogan was counting for them. "Hello, Jerry," he said. "Is Jack up yet?"
"No. He's still sleeping."
I went back to my room and packed up to go in to town.
About nine-thirty I heard Jack getting up in the next room.
When I heard him go downstairs I went down after him.
Jack was sitting at the breakfast table.
Hogan had come in and was standing beside the table.
"How do you feel, Jack?" I asked him.
"Not so bad."
"Sleep well?" Hogan asked.
"I slept all right," Jack said. "I got a thick tongue but I ain't got a head."
"Good," said Hogan. "That was good liquor."
"Put it on the bill," Jack says.
"What time you want to go into town?" Hogan asked.
"Before lunch," Jack says. "The eleven o'clock train."
"Sit down, Jerry," Jack said. Hogan went out.
I sat down at the table.
Jack was eating a grape-fruit.
When he'd find a seed he'd spit it out in the spoon and dump it on the plate.
"I guess I was pretty stewed last night," he started.
"You drank some liquor."
"I guess I said a lot of fool things."
"You weren't bad."
"Where's Hogan?" he asked. He was through with the grape-fruit.
"He's out in front in the office."
"What did I say about betting on the fight?" Jack asked. He was holding the spoon and sort of poking at the grape-fruit with it.
The girl came in with some ham and eggs and took away the grape-fruit.
"Bring me another glass of milk," Jack said to her. She went out.
"You said you had fifty grand on Walcott," I said.
"That's right," Jack said.
"That's a lot of money."
"I don't feel too good about it," Jack said.
"Something might happen."
"No," Jack said. "He wants the title bad. They'll be shooting with him all right."
"You can't ever tell."
"No. He wants the title. It's worth a lot of money to him."
"Fifty grand is a lot of money," I said.
"It's business," said Jack. "I can't win. You know I can't win anyway."
"As long as you're in there you got a chance."
"No," Jack says. "I'm all through. It's just business."
"How do you feel?"
"Pretty good," Jack said. "The sleep was what I needed."
"You might go good."
"I'll give them a good show," Jack said.
After breakfast Jack called up his wife on the long-distance.
He was inside the booth telephoning.
"That's the first time he's called her up since he's out here," Hogan said.
"He writes her every day."
"Sure," Hogan says, "a letter only costs two cents."
Hogan said good-by to us and Bruce, the nigger rubber, drove us down to the train in the cart.
"Good-by, Mr. Brennan," Bruce said at the train, "I sure hope you knock his can off."
"So long," Jack said. He gave Bruce two dollars. Bruce had worked on him a lot. He looked kind of disappointed. Jack saw me looking at Bruce holding the two dollars.
"It's all in the bill," he said. "Hogan charged me for the rubbing."
On the train going into town Jack didn't talk.
He sat in the corner of the seat with his ticket in his hat-band and looked out of the window.
Once he turned and spoke to me.
"I told the wife I'd take a room at the Shelby to-night," he said. "It's just around the corner from the Garden. I can go up to the house to-morrow morning."
"That's a good idea," I said. "Your wife ever see you fight, Jack?"
"No," Jack says. "She never seen me fight."
I thought he must be figuring on taking an awful beating if he doesn't want to go home afterward.
In town we took a taxi up to the Shelby.
A boy came out and took our bags and we went in to the desk.
"How much are the rooms?" Jack asked.
"We only have double rooms," the clerk says. "I can give you a nice double room for ten dollars."
"That's too steep."
"I can give you a double room for seven dollars."
"With a bath?"
"Certainly."
"You might as well bunk with me, Jerry," Jack says.
"Oh," I said, "I'll sleep down at my brother-in-law's."
"I don't mean for you to pay it," Jack says. "I just want to get my money's worth."
"Will you register, please?" the clerk says. He looked at the names. "Number 238, Mister Brennan."
We went up in the elevator.
It was a nice big room with two beds and a door opening into a bath-room.
"This is pretty good," Jack says.
The boy who brought us up pulled up the curtains and brought in our bags.
Jack didn't make any move, so I gave the boy a quarter.
We washed up and Jack said we better go out and get something to eat.
We ate a lunch at Jimmey Handley's place.
Quite a lot of the boys were there.
When we were about half through eating, John came in and sat down with us.
Jack didn't talk much.
"How are you on the weight, Jack?" John asked him. Jack was putting away a pretty good lunch.
"I could make it with my clothes on," Jack said. He never had to worry about taking off weight. He was a natural welter-weight and he'd never gotten fat. He'd lost weight out at Hogan's.
"Well, that's one thing you never had to worry about," John said.
"That's one thing," Jack says.
We went around to the garden to weigh in after lunch.
The match was made at a hundred forty-seven pounds at three o'clock.
Jack stepped on the scales with a towel around him.
The bar didn't move.
Walcott had just weighed and was standing with a lot of people around him.
"Let's see what you weigh, Jack," Freedman, Walcott's manager said.
"All right, weigh him then," Jack jerked his head toward Walcott.
"Drop the towel," Freedman said.
"What do you make it?" Jack asked the fellows who were weighing.
"One hundred and forty-three pounds," the fat man who was weighing said.
"You're down fine, Jack," Freedman says.
"Weigh him," Jack says.
Walcott came over.
He was a blond with wide shoulders and arms like a heavyweight.
He didn't have much legs.
Jack stood about half a head taller than he did.
"Hello, Jack," he said. His face was plenty marked up.
"Hello," said Jack. "How you feel?"
"Good," Walcott says. He dropped the towel from around his waist and stood on the scales. He had the widest shoulders and back you ever saw.
"One hundred and forty-six pounds and twelve ounces."
Walcott stepped off and grinned at Jack.
"Well," John says to him, "Jack's spotting you about four pounds."
"More than that when I come in, kid," Walcott says. "I'm going to go and eat now."
We went back and Jack got dressed.
"He's a pretty tough-looking boy," Jack says to me.
"He looks as though he'd been hit plenty of times."
"Oh, yes," Jack says. "He ain't hard to hit."
"Where are you going?" John asked when Jack was dressed.
"Back to the hotel," Jack says. "You looked after everything?"
"Yes," John says. "It's all looked after."
"I'm going to lie down a while," Jack says.
"I'll come around for you about a quarter to seven and we'll go and eat."
"All right."
Up at the hotel Jack took off his shoes and his coat and lay down for a while.
I wrote a letter.
I looked over a couple of times and Jack wasn't sleeping.
He was lying perfectly still but every once in a while his eyes would open.
Finally he sits up.
"Want to play some cribbage, Jerry?" he says.
"Sure," I said.
He went over to his suitcase and got out the cards and the cribbage board.
We played cribbage and he won three dollars off me.
John knocked at the door and came in.
"Want to play some cribbage, John?" Jack asked him.
John put his kelly down on the table.
It was all wet.
His coat was wet too.
"Is it raining?" Jack asks.
"It's pouring," John says. "The taxi I had, got tied up in the traffic and I got out and walked."
"Come on, play some cribbage," Jack says.
"You ought to go and eat."
"No," says Jack. "I don't want to eat yet."
So they played cribbage for about half an hour and Jack won a dollar and a half off him.
"Well, I suppose we got to go eat," Jack says. He went to the window and looked out.
"Is it still raining?"
"Yes."
"Let's eat in the hotel," John says.
"All right," Jack says, "I'll play you once more to see who pays for the meal."
After a little while Jack gets up and says, "You buy the meal, John," and we went downstairs and ate in the big dining-room.
After we ate we went upstairs and Jack played cribbage with John again and won two dollars and a half off him.
Jack was feeling pretty good.
John had a bag with him with all his stuff in it.
Jack took off his shirt and collar and put on a jersey and a sweater, so he wouldn't catch cold when he came out, and put his ring clothes and his bathrobe in a bag.
"You all ready?" John asks him. "I'll call up and have them get a taxi."
Pretty soon the telephone rang and they said the taxi was waiting.
We rode down in the elevator and went out through the lobby, and got in a taxi and rode around to the Garden.
It was raining hard but there was a lot of people outside on the streets.
The Garden was sold out.
As we came in on our way to the dressing-room I saw how full it was.
It looked like half a mile down to the ring.
It was all dark.
Just the lights over the ring.
"It's a good thing, with this rain, they didn't try and pull this fight in the ball park," John said.
"They got a good crowd," Jack says.
"This is a fight that would draw a lot more than the Garden could hold."
"You can't tell about the weather," Jack says.
John came to the door of the dressing-room and poked his head in.
Jack was sitting there with his bathrobe on, he had his arms folded and was looking at the floor.
John had a couple of handlers with him.
They looked over his shoulder.
Jack looked up.
"Is he in?" he asked.
"He's just gone down," John said.
We started down.
Walcott was just getting into the ring.
The crowd gave him a big hand.
He climbed through between the ropes and put his two fists together and smiled, and shook them at the crowd, first at one side of the ring, then at the other, and then sat down.
Jack got a good hand coming down through the crowd.
Jack is Irish and the Irish always get a pretty good hand.
An Irishman don't draw in New York like a Jew or an Italian but they always get a good hand.
Jack climbed up and bent down to go through the ropes and Walcott came over from his corner and pushed the rope down for Jack to go through.
The crowd thought that was wonderful.
Walcott put his hand on Jack's shoulder and they stood there just for a second.
"So you're going to be one of these popular champions," Jack says to him. "Take your goddam hand off my shoulder."
"Be yourself," Walcott says.
This is all great for the crowd.
How gentlemanly the boys are before the fight! How they wish each other luck!.
Solly Freedman came over to our corner while Jack is bandaging his hands and John is over in Walcott's corner.
Jack puts his thumb through the slit in the bandage and then wrapped his hand nice and smooth.
I taped it around the wrist and twice across the knuckles.
"Hey," Freedman says. "Where do you get all that tape?"
"Feel of it," Jack says. "It's soft, ain't it? Don't be a hick."
Freedman stands there all the time while Jack bandages the other hand, and one of the boys that's going to handle him brings the gloves and I pull them on and work them around.
"Say, Freedman," Jack asks, "what nationality is this Walcott?"
"I don't know," Solly says. "He's some sort of a Dane."
"He's a Bohemian," the lad who brought the gloves said.
The referee called them out to the centre of the ring and Jack walks out.
Walcott comes out smiling.
They met and the referee put his arm on each of their shoulders.
"Hello, popularity," Jack says to Walcott.
"Be yourself."
"What do you call yourself 'Walcott' for?" Jack says. "Didn't you know he was a nigger?"
"Listen--" says the referee, and he gives them the same old line. Once Walcott interrupts him. He grabs Jack's arm and says, "Can I hit when he's got me like this?"
"Keep your hands off me," Jack says. "There ain't no moving-pictures of this."
They went back to their corners.
I lifted the bathrobe off Jack and he leaned on the ropes and flexed his knees a couple of times and scuffed his shoes in the rosin.
The gong rang and Jack turned quick and went out.
Walcott came toward him and they touched gloves and as soon as Walcott dropped his hands Jack jumped his left into his face twice.
There wasn't anybody ever boxed better than Jack.
Walcott was after him, going forward all the time with his chin on his chest.
He's a hooker and he carries his hands pretty low.
All he knows is to get in there and sock.
But every time he gets in there close, Jack has the left hand in his face.
It's just as though it's automatic.
Jack just raises the left hand up and it's in Walcott's face.
Three or four times Jack brings the right over but Walcott gets it on the shoulder or high up on the head.
He's just like all these hookers.
The only thing he's afraid of is another one of the same kind.
He's covered everywhere you can hurt him.
He don't care about a left-hand in his face.
After about four rounds Jack has him bleeding bad and his face all cut up, but every time Walcott's got in close he's socked so hard he's got two big red patches on both sides just below Jack's ribs.
Every time he gets in close, Jack ties him up, then gets one hand loose and uppercuts him, but when Walcott gets his hands loose he socks Jack in the body so they can hear it outside in the street.
He's a socker.
It goes along like that for three rounds more.
They don't talk any.
They're working all the time.
We worked over Jack plenty too, in between the rounds.
He don't look good at all but he never does much work in the ring.
He don't move around much and that left-hand is just automatic.
It's just like it was connected with Walcott's face and Jack just had to wish it in every time.
Jack is always calm in close and he doesn't waste any juice.
He knows everything about working in close too and he's getting away with a lot of stuff.
While they were in our corner I watched him tie Walcott up, get his right hand loose, turn it and come up with an uppercut that got Walcott's nose with the heel of the glove.
Walcott was bleeding bad and leaned his nose on Jack's shoulder so as to give Jack some of it too, and Jack sort of lifted his shoulder sharp and caught him against the nose, and then brought down the right hand and did the same thing again.
Walcott was sore as hell.
By the time they'd gone five rounds he hated Jack's guts.
Jack wasn't sore; that is, he wasn't any sorer than he always was.
He certainly did used to make the fellows he fought hate boxing.
That was why he hated Kid Lewis so.
He never got the Kid's goat.
Kid Lewis always had about three new dirty things Jack couldn't do.
Jack was as safe as a church all the time he was in there, as long as he was strong.
He certainly was treating Walcott rough.
The funny thing was it looked as though Jack was an open classic boxer.
That was because he had all that stuff too.
After the seventh round Jack says, "My left's getting heavy.
From then he started to take a beating.
It didn't show at first.
But instead of him running the fight it was Walcott was running it, instead of being safe all the time now he was in trouble.
He couldn't keep him out with the left hand now.
It looked as though it was the same as ever, only now instead of Walcott's punches just missing him they were just hitting him.
He took an awful beating in the body.
"What's the round?" Jack asked.
"The eleventh."
"I can't stay," Jack says. "My legs are going bad."
Walcott had been just hitting him for a long time.
It was like a baseball catcher pulls the ball and takes some of the shock off.
From now on Walcott commenced to land solid.
He certainly was a socking-machine.
Jack was just trying to block everything now.
It didn't show what an awful beating he was taking.
In between the rounds I worked on his legs.
The muscles would flutter under my hands all the time I was rubbing them.
He was sick as hell.
"How's it go?" he asked John, turning around, his face all swollen.
"It's his fight."
"I think I can last," Jack says. "I don't want this bohunk to stop me."
It was going just the way he thought it would.
He knew he couldn't beat Walcott.
He wasn't strong any more.
He was all right though.
His money was all right and now he wanted to finish it off right to please himself.
He didn't want to be knocked out.
The gong rang and we pushed him out.
He went out slow.
Walcott came right out after him.
Jack put the left in his face and Walcott took it, came in under it and started working on Jack's body.
Jack tried to tie him up and it was just like trying to hold on to a buzz-saw.
Jack broke away from it and missed with the right.
Walcott clipped him with a left-hook and Jack went down.
He went down on his hands and knees and looked at us.
The referee started counting.
Jack was watching us and shaking his head.
At eight John motioned to him.
You couldn't hear on account of the crowd.
Jack got up.
The referee had been holding Walcott back with one arm while he counted.
When Jack was on his feet Walcott started toward him.
"Watch yourself, Jimmy," I heard Solly Freedman yell to him.
Walcott came up to Jack looking at him.
Jack stuck the left hand at him.
Walcott just shook his head.
He backed Jack up against the ropes, measured him and then hooked the left very light to the side of Jack's head and socked the right into the body as hard as he could sock, just as low as he could get it.
He must have hit him five inches below the belt.
I thought the eyes would come out of Jack's head.
They stuck way out.
His mouth come open.
The referee grabbed Walcott.
Jack stepped forward.
If he went down there went fifty thousand bucks.
He walked as though all his insides were going to fall out.
"It wasn't low," he said. "It was a accident."
The crowd were yelling so you couldn't hear anything.
"I'm all right," Jack says. They were right in front of us. The referee looks at John and then he shakes his head.
"Come on, you polak son-of-a-bitch," Jack says to Walcott.
John was hanging onto the ropes.
He had the towel ready to chuck in.
Jack was standing just a little way out from the ropes.
He took a step forward.
I saw the sweat come out on his face like somebody had squeezed it and a big drop went down his nose.
"Come on and fight," Jack says to Walcott.
The referee looked at John and waved Walcott on.
"Go in there, you slob," he says.
Walcott went in.
He didn't know what to do either.
He never thought Jack could have stood it.
Jack put the left in his face.
There was such a hell of a lot of yelling going on.
They were right in front of us.
Walcott hit him twice.
Jack's face was the worst thing I ever saw,--the look on it! He was holding himself and all his body together and it all showed on his face.
All the time he was thinking and holding his body in where it was busted.
Then he started to sock.
His face looked awful all the time.
He started to sock with his hands low down by his side, swinging at Walcott.
Walcott covered up and Jack was swinging wild at Walcott's head.
Then he swung the left and it hit Walcott in the groin and the right hit Walcott right bang where he'd hit Jack.
Way low below the belt.
Walcott went down and grabbed himself there and rolled and twisted around.
The referee grabbed Jack and pushed him toward his corner.
John jumps into the ring.
There was all this yelling going on.
The referee was talking with the judges and then the announcer got into the ring with the megaphone and says, "Walcott on a foul.
The referee is talking to John and he says, "What could I do? Jack wouldn't take the foul.
Then when he's groggy he fouls him.
"He'd lost it anyway," John says.
Jack's sitting on the chair.
I've got his gloves off and he's holding himself in down there with both hands.
When he's got something supporting it his face doesn't look so bad.
"Go over and say you're sorry," John says into his ear. "It'll look good."
Jack stands up and the sweat comes out all over his face.
I put the bathrobe around him and he holds himself in with one hand under the bathrobe and goes across the ring.
They've picked Walcott up and they're working on him.
There're a lot of people in Walcott's corner.
Nobody speaks to Jack.
He leans over Walcott.
"I'm sorry," Jack says. "I didn't mean to foul you."
Walcott doesn't say anything.
He looks too damned sick.
"Well, you're the champion now," Jack says to him. "I hope you get a hell of a lot of fun out of it."
"Leave the kid alone," Solly Freedman says.
"Hello, Solly," Jack says. "I'm sorry I fouled your boy."
Freedman just looks at him.
Jack went to his corner walking that funny jerky way and we got him down through the ropes and through the reporters' tables and out down the aisle.
A lot of people want to slap Jack on the back.
He goes out through all that mob in his bathrobe to the dressing-room.
It's a popular win for Walcott.
That's the way the money was bet in the Garden.
Once we got inside the dressing-room Jack lay down and shut his eyes.
"We want to get to the hotel and get a doctor," John says.
"I'm all busted inside," Jack says.
"I'm sorry as hell, Jack," John says.
"It's all right," Jack says.
He lies there with his eyes shut.
"They certainly tried a nice double-cross," John said.
"Your friends Morgan and Steinfelt," Jack said. "You got nice friends."
He lies there, his eyes are open now.
His face has still got that awful drawn look.
"It's funny how fast you can think when it means that much money," Jack says.
"You're some boy, Jack," John says.
"No," Jack says. "It was nothing."
A Simple Enquiry.
Outside, the snow was higher than the window.
The sunlight came in through the window and shone on a map on the pine-board wall of the hut.
The sun was high and the light came in over the top of the snow.
A trench had been cut along the open side of the hut, and each clear day the sun, shining on the wall, reflected heat against the snow and widened the trench.
It was late March.
The major sat at a table against the wall.
His adjutant sat at another table.
Around the major's eyes were two white circles where his snow-glasses had protected his face from the sun on the snow.
The rest of his face had been burned and then tanned and then burned through the tan.
His nose was swollen and there were edges of loose skin where blisters had been.
While he worked at the papers he put the fingers of his left hand into a saucer of oil and then spread the oil over his face, touching it very gently with the tips of his fingers.
He was very careful to drain his fingers on the edge of the saucer so there was only a film of oil on them, and after he had stroked his forehead and his cheeks, he stroked his nose very delicately between his fingers.
When he had finished he stood up, took the saucer of oil and went into the small room of the hut where he slept.
"I'm going to take a little sleep," he said to the adjutant.
In that army an adjutant is not a commissioned officer.
"You will finish up.
"Yes, signor maggiore," the adjutant answered. He leaned back in his chair and yawned. He took a paper-covered book out of the pocket of his coat and opened it; then laid it down on the table and lit his pipe. He leaned forward on the table to read and puffed at his pipe. Then he closed the book and put it back in his pocket. He had too much paper-work to get through. He could not enjoy reading until it was done. Outside, the sun went behind a mountain and there was no more light on the wall of the hut. A soldier came in and put some pine branches, chopped into irregular lengths, into the stove. "Be soft, Pinin," the adjutant said to him. "The major is sleeping."
Pinin was the major's orderly.
He was a dark-faced boy, and he fixed the stove, putting the pine wood in carefully, shut the door, and went into the back of the hut again.
The adjutant went on with his papers.
"Tonani," the major called.
"Signor maggiore?"
"Send Pinin in to me."
"Pinin!" the adjutant called. Pinin came into the room. "The major wants you," the adjutant said.
Pinin walked across the main room of the hut toward the major's door.
He knocked on the half-opened door.
"Signor maggiore?".
"Come in," the adjutant heard the major say, "and shut the door."
Inside the room the major lay on his bunk.
Pinin stood beside the bunk.
The major lay with his head on the rucksack that he had stuffed with spare clothing to make a pillow.
His long, burned, oiled face looked at Pinin.
His hands lay on the blankets.
"You are nineteen?" he asked.
"Yes, signor maggiore."
"You have ever been in love?"
"How do you mean, signor maggiore?"
"In love--with a girl?"
"I have been with girls."
"I did not ask that. I asked if you had been in love--with a girl."
"Yes, signor maggiore."
"You are in love with this girl now? You don't write her. I read all your letters."
"I am in love with her," Pinin said, "but I do not write her."
"You are sure of this?"
"I am sure."
"Tonani," the major said in the same tone of voice, "can you hear me talking?"
There was no answer from the next room.
"He can not hear," the major said. "And you are quite sure that you love a girl?"
"I am sure."
"And," the major looked at him quickly, "that you are not corrupt?"
"I don't know what you mean, corrupt."
"All right," the major said. "You needn't be superior."
Pinin looked at the floor.
The major looked at his brown face, down and up him, and at his hands.
Then he went on, not smiling, "And you don't really want--" the major paused.
Pinin looked at the floor.
"That your great desire isn't really--" Pinin looked at the floor.
The major leaned his head back on the rucksack and smiled.
He was really relieved: life in the army was too complicated.
"You're a good boy," he said.
"You're a good boy, Pinin.
But don't be superior and be careful some one else doesn't come along and take you.
Pinin stood still beside the bunk.
"Don't be afraid," the major said. His hands were folded on the blankets. "I won't touch you. You can go back to your platoon if you like. But you had better stay on as my servant. You've less chance of being killed."
"Do you want anything of me, signor maggiore?"
"No," the major said. "Go on and get on with whatever you were doing. Leave the door open when you go out."
Pinin went out, leaving the door open.
The adjutant looked up at him as he walked awkwardly across the room and out the door.
Pinin was flushed and moved differently than he had moved when he brought in the wood for the fire.
The adjutant looked after him and smiled.
Pinin came in with more wood for the stove.
The major, lying on his bunk, looking at his cloth-covered helmet and his snow-glasses that hung from a nail on the wall, heard him walk across the floor.
The little devil, he thought, I wonder if he lied to me.
Ten Indians.
After one Fourth of July, Nick, driving home late from town in the big wagon with Joe Garner and his family, passed nine drunken Indians along the road.
He remembered there were nine because Joe Garner, driving along in the dusk, pulled up the horses, jumped down into the road and dragged an Indian out of the wheel rut.
The Indian had been asleep, face down in the sand.
Joe dragged him into the bushes and got back up on the wagon-box.
"That makes nine of them," Joe said, "just between here and the edge of town."
"Them Indians," said Mrs. Garner.
Nick was on the back seat with the two Garner boys.
He was looking out from the back seat to see the Indian where Joe had dragged him alongside of the road.
"Was it Billy Tabeshaw?" Carl asked.
"No."
"His pants looked mighty like Billy."
"All Indians wear the same kind of pants."
"I didn't see him at all," Frank said. "Pa was down into the road and back up again before I seen a thing. I thought he was killing a snake."
"Plenty of Indians'll kill snakes to-night, I guess," Joe Garner said.
"Them Indians," said Mrs. Garner.
They drove along.
The road turned off from the main highway and went up into the hills.
It was hard pulling for the horses and the boys got down and walked.
The road was sandy.
Nick looked back from the top of the hill by the schoolhouse.
He saw the lights of Petoskey and, off across Little Traverse Bay, the lights of Harbour Springs.
They climbed back in the wagon again.
"They ought to put some gravel on that stretch," Joe Garner said. The wagon went along the road through the woods. Joe and Mrs. Garner sat close together on the front seat. Nick sat between the two boys. The road came out into a clearing.
"Right here was where Pa ran over the skunk."
"It was further on."
"It don't make no difference where it was," Joe said without turning his head. "One place is just as good as another to run over a skunk."
"I saw two skunks last night," Nick said.
"Where?"
"Down by the lake. They were looking for dead fish along the beach."
"They were coons probably," Carl said.
"They were skunks. I guess I know skunks."
"You ought to," Carl said. "You got an Indian girl."
"Stop talking that way, Carl," said Mrs. Garner.
"Well, they smell about the same."
Joe Garner laughed.
"You stop laughing, Joe," Mrs. Garner said. "I won't have Carl talk that way."
"Have you got an Indian girl, Nickie?" Joe asked.
"No."
"He has too, Pa," Frank said. "Prudence Mitchell's his girl."
"She's not."
"He goes to see her every day."
"I don't." Nick, sitting between the two boys in the dark, felt hollow and happy inside himself to be teased about Prudence Mitchell. "She ain't my girl," he said.
"Listen to him," said Carl. "I see them together every day."
"Carl can't get a girl," his mother said, "not even a squaw."
Carl was quiet.
"Carl ain't no good with girls," Frank said.
"You shut up."
"You're all right, Carl," Joe Garner said. "Girls never got a man anywhere. Look at your pa."
"Yes, that's what you would say," Mrs. Garner moved close to Joe as the wagon jolted. "Well, you had plenty of girls in your time."
"I'll bet Pa wouldn't ever have had a squaw for a girl."
"Don't you think it," Joe said. "You better watch out to keep Prudie, Nick."
His wife whispered to him and Joe laughed.
"What you laughing at?" asked Frank.
"Don't you say it, Garner," his wife warned. Joe laughed again.
"Nickie can have Prudence," Joe Garner said. "I got a good girl."
"That's the way to talk," Mrs. Garner said.
The horses were pulling heavily in the sand.
Joe reached out in the dark with the whip.
"Come on, pull into it. You'll have to pull harder than this to-morrow."
They trotted down the long hill, the wagon jolting.
At the farmhouse everybody got down.
Mrs.
Garner unlocked the door, went inside, and came out with a lamp in her hand.
Carl and Nick unloaded the things from the back of the wagon.
Frank sat on the front seat to drive to the barn and put up the horses.
Nick went up the steps and opened the kitchen door.
Mrs.
Garner was building a fire in the stove.
She turned from pouring kerosene on the wood.
"Good-by, Mrs. Garner," Nick said. "Thanks for taking me."
"Oh shucks, Nickie."
"I had a wonderful time."
"We like to have you. Won't you stay and eat some supper?"
"I better go. I think Dad probably waited for me."
"Well, get along then. Send Carl up to the house, will you?"
"All right."
"Good-night, Nickie."
"Good-night, Mrs. Garner."
Nick went out the farmyard and down to the barn.
Joe and Frank were milking.
"Good-night," Nick said. "I had a swell time."
"Good-night, Nick," Joe Garner called. "Aren't you going to stay and eat?"
"No, I can't. Will you tell Carl his mother wants him?"
"All right. Good-night, Nickie."
Nick walked barefoot along the path through the meadow below the barn.
The path was smooth and the dew was cool on his bare feet.
He climbed a fence at the end of the meadow, went down through a ravine, his feet wet in the swamp mud, and then climbed up through the dry beech woods until he saw the lights of the cottage.
He climbed over the fence and walked around to the front porch.
Through the window he saw his father sitting by the table, reading in the light from the big lamp.
Nick opened the door and went in.
"Well, Nickie," his father said, "was it a good day?"
"I had a swell time, Dad. It was a swell Fourth of July."
"Are you hungry?"
"You bet."
"What did you do with your shoes?"
"I left them in the wagon at Garner's."
"Come on out to the kitchen."
Nick's father went ahead with the lamp.
He stopped and lifted the lid of the ice-box.
Nick went on into the kitchen.
His father brought in a piece of cold chicken on a plate and a pitcher of milk and put them on the table before Nick.
He put down the lamp.
"There's some pie too," he said. "Will that hold you?"
"It's grand."
His father sat down in a chair beside the oilcloth-covered table.
He made a big shadow on the kitchen wall.
"Who won the ball game?"
"Petoskey. Five to three."
His father sat watching him eat and filled his glass from the milk-pitcher.
Nick drank and wiped his mouth on his napkin.
His father reached over to the shelf for the pie.
He cut Nick a big piece.
It was huckleberry pie.
"What did you do, Dad?"
"I went out fishing in the morning."
"What did you get?"
"Only perch."
His father sat watching Nick eat the pie.
"What did you do this afternoon?" Nick asked.
"I went for a walk up by the Indian camp."
"Did you see anybody?"
"The Indians were all in town getting drunk."
"Didn't you see anybody at all?"
"I saw your friend, Prudie."
"Where was she?"
"She was in the woods with Frank Washburn. I ran onto them. They were having quite a time."
His father was not looking at him.
"What were they doing?"
"I didn't stay to find out."
"Tell me what they were doing."
"I don't know," his father said. "I just heard them threshing around."
"How did you know it was them?"
"I saw them."
"I thought you said you didn't see them."
"Oh, yes, I saw them."
"Who was it with her?" Nick asked.
"Frank Washburn."
"Were they--were they----"
"Were they what?"
"Were they happy?"
"I guess so."
His father got up from the table and went out the kitchen screen door.
When he came back Nick was looking at his plate.
He had been crying.
"Have some more?" His father picked up the knife to cut the pie.
"No," said Nick.
"You better have another piece."
"No, I don't want any."
His father cleared off the table.
"Where were they in the woods?" Nick asked.
"Up back of the camp." Nick looked at his plate. His father said, "You better go to bed, Nick."
"All right."
Nick went into his room, undressed, and got into bed.
He heard his father moving around in the living-room.
Nick lay in the bed with his face in the pillow.
"My heart's broken," he thought. "If I feel this way my heart must be broken."
After a while he heard his father blow out the lamp and go into his own room.
He heard a wind come up in the trees outside and felt it come in cool through the screen.
He lay for a long time with his face in the pillow, and after a while he forgot to think about Prudence and finally he went to sleep.
When he awoke in the night he heard the wind in the hemlock trees outside the cottage and the waves of the lake coming in on the shore, and he went back to sleep.
In the morning there was a big wind blowing and the waves were running high up on the beach and he was awake a long time before he remembered that his heart was broken.
A Canary for One.
The train passed very quickly a long, red stone house with a garden and four thick palm-trees with tables under them in the shade.
On the other side was the sea.
Then there was a cutting through red stone and clay, and the sea was only occasionally and far below against rocks.
"I bought him in Palermo," the American lady said. "We only had an hour ashore and it was Sunday morning. The man wanted to be paid in dollars and I gave him a dollar and a half. He really sings very beautifully."
It was very hot in the train and it was very hot in the lit salon compartment.
There was no breeze came through the open window.
The American lady pulled the window-blind down and there was no more sea, even occasionally.
On the other side there was glass, then the corridor, then an open window, and outside the window were dusty trees and an oiled road and flat fields of grapes, with gray-stone hills behind them.
There was smoke from many tall chimneys--coming into Marseilles, and the train slowed down and followed one track through many others into the station.
The train stayed twenty-five minutes in the station at Marseilles and the American lady bought a copy of The Daily Mail and a half-bottle of Evian water.
She walked a little way along the station platform, but she stayed near the steps of the car because at Cannes, where it stopped for twelve minutes, the train had left with no signal of departure and she had only gotten on just in time.
The American lady was a little deaf and she was afraid that perhaps signals of departure were given and that she did not hear them.
The train left the station in Marseilles and there was not only the switch-yards and the factory smoke but, looking back, the town of Marseilles and the harbor with stone hills behind it and the last of the sun on the water.
As it was getting dark the train passed a farmhouse burning in a field.
Motor-cars were stopped along the road and bedding and things from inside the farmhouse were spread in the field.
Many people were watching the house burn.
After it was dark the train was in Avignon.
People got on and off.
At the news-stand Frenchmen, returning to Paris, bought that day's French papers.
On the station platform were negro soldiers.
They wore brown uniforms and were tall and their faces shone, close under the electric light.
Their faces were very black and they were too tall to stare.
The train left Avignon station with the negroes standing there.
A short white sergeant was with them.
Inside the lit salon compartment the porter had pulled down the three beds from inside the wall and prepared them for sleeping.
In the night the American lady lay without sleeping because the train was a rapide and went very fast and she was afraid of the speed in the night.
The American lady's bed was the one next to the window.
The canary from Palermo, a cloth spread over his cage, was out of the draft in the corridor that went into the compartment wash-room.
There was a blue light outside the compartment, and all night the train went very fast and the American lady lay awake and waited for a wreck.
In the morning the train was near Paris, and after the American lady had come out from the wash-room, looking very wholesome and middle-aged and American in spite of not having slept, and had taken the cloth off the birdcage and hung the cage in the sun, she went back to the restaurant-car for breakfast.
When she came back to the lit salon compartment again, the beds had been pushed back into the wall and made into seats, the canary was shaking his feathers in the sunlight that came through the open window, and the train was much nearer Paris.
"He loves the sun," the American lady said. "He'll sing now in a little while."
The canary shook his feathers and pecked into them.
"I've always loved birds," the American lady said.
"I'm taking him home to my little girl.
There--he's singing now.
The canary chirped and the feathers on his throat stood out, then he dropped his bill and pecked into his feathers again.
The train crossed a river and passed through a very carefully tended forest.
The train passed through many outside of Paris towns.
There were tram-cars in the towns and big advertisements for the Belle Jardinière and Dubonnet and Pernod on the walls toward the train.
All that the train passed through looked as though it were before breakfast.
For several minutes I had not listened to the American lady, who was talking to my wife.
"Is your husband American too?" asked the lady.
"Yes," said my wife. "We're both Americans."
"I thought you were English."
"Oh, no."
"Perhaps that was because I wore braces," I said. I had started to say suspenders and changed it to braces in the mouth, to keep my English character. The American lady did not hear. She was really quite deaf; she read lips, and I had not looked toward her. I had looked out of the window. She went on talking to my wife.
"I'm so glad you're Americans. American men make the best husbands," the American lady was saying. "That was why we left the Continent, you know. My daughter fell in love with a man in Vevey." She stopped. "They were simply madly in love." She stopped again. "I took her away, of course."
"Did she get over it?" asked my wife.
"I don't think so," said the American lady. "She wouldn't eat anything and she wouldn't sleep at all. I've tried so very hard, but she doesn't seem to take an interest in anything. She doesn't care about things. I couldn't have her marrying a foreigner." She paused. "Some one, a very good friend, told me once, 'No foreigner can make an American girl a good husband.'"
"No," said my wife, "I suppose not."
The American lady admired my wife's travelling-coat, and it turned out that the American lady had bought her own clothes for twenty years now from the same maison de couturier in the Rue Saint Honoré.
They had her measurements, and a vendeuse who knew her and her tastes picked the dresses out for her and they were sent to America.
They came to the post-office near where she lived up-town in New York, and the duty was never exorbitant because they opened the dresses there in the post-office to appraise them and they were always very simple-looking and with no gold lace nor ornaments that would make the dresses look expensive.
Before the present vendeuse, named Thérèse, there had been another vendeuse, named Amélie.
Altogether there had only been these two in the twenty years.
It had always been the same couturier.
Prices, however, had gone up.
The exchange, though, equalized that.
They had her daughter's measurements now too.
She was grown up and there was not much chance of their changing now.
The train was now coming into Paris.
The fortifications were levelled but grass had not grown.
There were many cars standing on tracks--brown wooden restaurant-cars and brown wooden sleeping-cars that would go to Italy at five o'clock that night, if that train still left at five; the cars were marked Paris-Rome, and cars, with seats on the roofs, that went back and forth to the suburbs with, at certain hours, people in all the seats and on the roofs, if that were the way it were still done, and passing were the white walls and many windows of houses.
Nothing had eaten any breakfast.
"Americans make the best husbands," the American lady said to my wife. I was getting down the bags. "American men are the only men in the world to marry."
"How long ago did you leave Vevey?" asked my wife.
"Two years ago this fall. It's her, you know, that I'm taking the canary to."
"Was the man your daughter was in love with a Swiss?"
"Yes," said the American lady. "He was from a very good family in Vevey. He was going to be an engineer. They met there in Vevey. They used to go on long walks together."
"I know Vevey," said my wife. "We were there on our honeymoon."
"Were you really? That must have been lovely. I had no idea, of course, that she'd fall in love with him."
"It was a very lovely place," said my wife.
"Yes," said the American lady. "Isn't it lovely? Where did you stop there?"
"We stayed at the Trois Couronnes," said my wife.
"It's such a fine old hotel," said the American lady.
"Yes," said my wife. "We had a very fine room and in the fall the country was lovely."
"Were you there in the fall?"
"Yes," said my wife.
We were passing three cars that had been in a wreck.
They were splintered open and the roofs sagged in.
"Look," I said. "There's been a wreck."
The American lady looked and saw the last car.
"I was afraid of just that all night," she said.
"I have terrific presentiments about things sometimes.
I'll never travel on a rapide again at night.
There must be other comfortable trains that don't go so fast.
Then the train was in the dark of the Gare de Lyons, and then stopped and porters came up to the windows.
I handed bags through the windows, and we were out on the dim longness of the platform, and the American lady put herself in charge of one of three men from Cook's who said: "Just a moment, madame, and I'll look for your name.
The porter brought a truck and piled on the baggage, and my wife said good-by and I said good-by to the American lady, whose name had been found by the man from Cook's on a typewritten page in a sheaf of typewritten pages which he replaced in his pocket.
We followed the porter with the truck down the long cement platform beside the train.
At the end was a gate and a man took the tickets.
We were returning to Paris to set up separate residences.
An Alpine Idyll.
It was hot coming down into the valley even in the early morning.
The sun melted the snow from the skis we were carrying and dried the wood.
It was spring in the valley but the sun was very hot.
We came along the road into Galtur carrying our skis and rucksacks.
As we passed the churchyard a burial was just over.
I said, "Grüss Gott," to the priest as he walked past us coming out of the churchyard.
The priest bowed.
"It's funny a priest never speaks to you," John said.
"You'd think they'd like to say 'Grüss Gott.'"
"They never answer," John said.
We stopped in the road and watched the sexton shovelling in the new earth.
A peasant with a black beard and high leather boots stood beside the grave.
The sexton stopped shovelling and straightened his back.
The peasant in the high boots took the spade from the sexton and went on filling in the grave--spreading the earth evenly as a man spreading manure in a garden.
In the bright May morning the grave-filling looked unreal.
I could not imagine any one being dead.
"Imagine being buried on a day like this," I said to John.
"I wouldn't like it."
"Well," I said, "we don't have to do it."
We went on up the road past the houses of the town to the inn.
We had been skiing in the Silvretta for a month, and it was good to be down in the valley.
In the Silvretta the skiing had been all right, but it was spring skiing, the snow was good only in the early morning and again in the evening.
The rest of the time it was spoiled by the sun.
We were both tired of the sun.
You could not get away from the sun.
The only shadows were made by rocks or by the hut that was built under the protection of a rock beside a glacier, and in the shade the sweat froze in your underclothing.
You could not sit outside the hut without dark glasses.
It was pleasant to be burned black but the sun had been very tiring.
You could not rest in it.
I was glad to be down away from snow.
It was too late in the spring to be up in the Silvretta.
I was a little tired of skiing.
We had stayed too long.
I could taste the snow water we had been drinking melted off the tin roof of the hut.
The taste was a part of the way I felt about skiing.
I was glad there were other things beside skiing, and I was glad to be down, away from the unnatural high mountain spring, into this May morning in the valley.
The innkeeper sat on the porch of the inn, his chair tipped back against the wall.
Beside him sat the cook.
"Ski-heil!" said the innkeeper.
"Heil!" we said and leaned the skis against the wall and took off our packs.
"How was it up above?" asked the innkeeper.
"Schön. A little too much sun."
"Yes. There's too much sun this time of year."
The cook sat on in his chair.
The innkeeper went in with us and unlocked his office and brought out our mail.
There was a bundle of letters and some papers.
"Let's get some beer," John said.
"Good. We'll drink it inside."
The proprietor brought two bottles and we drank them while we read the letters.
"We better have some more beer," John said. A girl brought it this time. She smiled as she opened the bottles.
"Many letters," she said.
"Yes. Many."
"Prosit," she said and went out, taking the empty bottles.
"I'd forgotten what beer tasted like."
"I hadn't," John said. "Up in the hut I used to think about it a lot."
"Well," I said, "we've got it now."
"You oughtn't to ever do anything too long."
"No. We were up there too long."
"Too damn long," John said. "It's no good doing a thing too long."
The sun came through the open window and shone through the beer bottles on the table.
The bottles were half full.
There was a little froth on the beer in the bottles, not much because it was very cold.
It collared up when you poured it into the tall glasses.
I looked out of the open window at the white road.
The trees beside the road were dusty.
Beyond was a green field and a stream.
There were trees along the stream and a mill with a water wheel.
Through the open side of the mill I saw a long log and a saw in it rising and falling.
No one seemed to be tending it.
There were four crows walking in the green field.
One crow sat in a tree watching.
Outside on the porch the cook got off his chair and passed into the hall that led back into the kitchen.
Inside, the sunlight shone through the empty glasses on the table.
John was leaning forward with his head on his arms.
Through the window I saw two men come up the front steps.
They came into the drinking room.
One was the bearded peasant in the high boots.
The other was the sexton.
They sat down at the table under the window.
The girl came in and stood by their table.
The peasant did not seem to see her.
He sat with his hands on the table.
He wore his old army clothes.
There were patches on the elbows.
"What will it be?" asked the sexton. The peasant did not pay any attention.
"What will you drink?"
"Schnapps," the peasant said.
"And a quarter litre of red wine," the sexton told the girl.
The girl brought the drinks and the peasant drank the schnapps.
He looked out of the window.
The sexton watched him.
John had his head forward on the table.
He was asleep.
The innkeeper came in and went over to the table.
He spoke in dialect and the sexton answered him.
The peasant looked out of the window.
The innkeeper went out of the room.
The peasant stood up.
He took a folded ten-thousand kronen note out of a leather pocket-book and unfolded it.
The girl came up.
"Alles?" she asked.
"Alles," he said.
"Let me buy the wine," the sexton said.
"Alles," the peasant repeated to the girl. She put her hand in the pocket of her apron, brought it out full of coins and counted out the change. The peasant went out the door. As soon as he was gone the innkeeper came into the room again and spoke to the sexton. He sat down at the table. They talked in dialect. The sexton was amused. The innkeeper was disgusted. The sexton stood up from the table. He was a little man with a mustache. He leaned out of the window and looked up the road.
"There he goes in," he said.
"In the Löwen?"
"Ja."
They talked again and then the innkeeper came over to our table.
The innkeeper was a tall man and old.
He looked at John asleep.
"He's pretty tired."
"Yes, we were up early."
"Will you want to eat soon?"
"Any time," I said. "What is there to eat?"
"Anything you want. The girl will bring the eating-card."
The girl brought the menu.
John woke up.
The menu was written in ink on a card and the card slipped into a wooden paddle.
"There's the speise-karte," I said to John. He looked at it. He was still sleepy.
"Won't you have a drink with us?" I asked the innkeeper. He sat down. "Those peasants are beasts," said the innkeeper.
"We saw that one at a funeral coming into town."
"That was his wife."
"Oh."
"He's a beast. All these peasants are beasts."
"How do you mean?"
"You wouldn't believe it. You wouldn't believe what just happened about that one."
"Tell me."
"You wouldn't believe it." The innkeeper spoke to the sexton. "Franz, come over here." The sexton came, bringing his little bottle of wine and his glass.
"The gentlemen are just come down from the Wiesbadenerhütte," the innkeeper said. We shook hands.
"What will you drink?" I asked.
"Nothing," Franz shook his finger.
"Another quarter litre?"
"All right."
"Do you understand dialect?" the innkeeper asked.
"No."
"What's it all about?" John asked.
"He's going to tell us about the peasant we saw filling the grave, coming into town."
"I can't understand it, anyway," John said. "It goes too fast for me."
"That peasant," the innkeeper said, "to-day he brought his wife in to be buried. She died last November."
"December," said the sexton.
"That makes nothing. She died last December then, and he notified the commune."
"December eighteenth," said the sexton.
"Anyway, he couldn't bring her over to be buried until the snow was gone."
"He lives on the other side of the Paznaun," said the sexton. "But he belongs to this parish."
"He couldn't bring her out at all?" I asked.
"No. He can only come, from where he lives, on skis until the snow melts. So to-day he brought her in to be buried and the priest, when he looked at her face, didn't want to bury her. You go on and tell it," he said to the sexton. "Speak German, not dialect."
"It was very funny with the priest," said the sexton. "In the report to the commune she died of heart trouble. We knew she had heart trouble here. She used to faint in church sometimes. She did not come for a long time. She wasn't strong to climb. When the priest uncovered her face he asked Olz, 'Did your wife suffer much?' 'No,' said Olz. 'When I came in the house she was dead across the bed.'
"The priest looked at her again. He didn't like it.
"'How did her face get that way?'
"'I don't know,' Olz said.
"'You'd better find out,' the priest said, and put the blanket back. Olz didn't say anything. The priest looked at him. Olz looked back at the priest. 'You want to know?'
"'I must know,' the priest said."
"This is where it's good," the innkeeper said. "Listen to this. Go on Franz."
"'Well,' said Olz, 'when she died I made the report to the commune and I put her in the shed across the top of the big wood. When I started to use the big wood she was stiff and I put her up against the wall. Her mouth was open and when I came into the shed at night to cut up the big wood, I hung the lantern from it.'
"'Why did you do that?' asked the priest.
"'I don't know,' said Olz.
"'Did you do that many times?'
"'Every time I went to work in the shed at night.'
"'It was very wrong,' said the priest. 'Did you love your wife?'
"'Ja, I loved her,' Olz said. 'I loved her fine.'"
"Did you understand it all?" asked the innkeeper. "You understand it all about his wife?"
"I heard it."
"How about eating?" John asked.
"You order," I said. "Do you think it's true?" I asked the innkeeper.
"Sure it's true," he said. "These peasants are beasts."
"Where did he go now?"
"He's gone to drink at my colleague's, the Löwen."
"He didn't want to drink with me," said the sexton.
"He didn't want to drink with me, after he knew about his wife," said the innkeeper.
"Say," said John. "How about eating?"
"All right," I said.
A Pursuit Race.
William Campbell had been in a pursuit race with a burlesque show ever since Pittsburgh.
In a pursuit race, in bicycle racing, riders start at equal intervals to ride after one another.
They ride very fast because the race is usually limited to a short distance and if they slow their riding another rider who maintains his pace will make up the space that separated them equally at the start.
As soon as a rider is caught and passed he is out of the race and must get down from his bicycle and leave the track.
If none of the riders are caught the winner of the race is the one who has gained the most distance.
In most pursuit races, if there are only two riders, one of the riders is caught inside of six miles.
The burlesque show caught William Campbell at Kansas City.
William Campbell had hoped to hold a slight lead over the burlesque show until they reached the Pacific coast.
As long as he preceded the burlesque show as advance man he was being paid.
When the burlesque show caught up with him he was in bed.
He was in bed when the manager of the burlesque troupe came into his room and after the manager had gone out he decided that he might as well stay in bed.
It was very cold in Kansas City and he was in no hurry to go out.
He did not like Kansas City.
He reached under the bed for a bottle and drank.
It made his stomach feel better.
Turner, the manager of the burlesque show, had refused a drink.
William Campbell's interview with Mr.
Turner had been a little strange.
Turner had knocked on the door.
Campbell had said: "Come in!" When Mr.
Turner came into the room he saw clothing on a chair, an open suitcase, the bottle on a chair beside the bed, and some one lying in the bed completely covered by the bed-clothes.
"Mister Campbell," Mr. Turner said.
"You can't fire me," William Campbell said from underneath the covers. It was warm and white and close under the covers. "You can't fire me because I've got down off my bicycle."
"You're drunk," Mr. Turner said.
"Oh, yes," William Campbell said, speaking directly against the sheet and feeling the texture with his lips.
"You're a fool," Mr. Turner said. He turned off the electric light. The electric light had been burning all night. It was now ten o'clock in the morning. "You're a drunken fool. When did you get into this town?"
"I got into this town last night," William Campbell said, speaking against the sheet. He found he liked to talk through a sheet. "Did you ever talk through a sheet?"
"Don't try to be funny. You aren't funny."
"I'm not being funny. I'm just talking through a sheet."
"You're talking through a sheet all right."
"You can go now, Mr. Turner," Campbell said. "I don't work for you any more."
"You know that anyway."
"I know a lot," William Campbell said. He pulled down the sheet and looked at Mr. Turner. "I know enough so I don't mind looking at you at all. Do you want to hear what I know?"
"No."
"Good," said William Campbell. "Because really I don't know anything at all. I was just talking." He pulled the sheet up over his face again. "I love it under a sheet," he said. Mr. Turner stood beside the bed. He was a middle-aged man with a large stomach and a bald head and he had many things to do. "You ought to stop off here, Billy, and take a cure," he said. "I'll fix it up if you want to do it."
"I don't want to take a cure," William Campbell said. "I don't want to take a cure at all. I am perfectly happy. All my life I have been perfectly happy."
"How long have you been this way?"
"What a question!" William Campbell breathed in and out through the sheet.
"How long have you been stewed, Billy?"
"Haven't I done my work?"
"Sure. I just asked you how long you've been stewed, Billy."
"I don't know. But I've got my wolf back," he touched the sheet with his tongue. "I've had him for a week."
"The hell you have."
"Oh, yes. My dear wolf. Every time I take a drink he goes outside the room. He can't stand alcohol. The poor little fellow." He moved his tongue round and round on the sheet. "He's a lovely wolf. He's just like he always was." William Campbell shut his eyes and took a deep breath.
"You got to take a cure, Billy," Mr. Turner said. "You won't mind the Keeley. It isn't bad."
"The Keeley," William Campbell said. "It isn't far from London." He shut his eyes and opened them, moving the eyelashes against the sheet. "I just love sheets," he said. He looked at Mr. Turner.
"Listen, you think I'm drunk."
"You are drunk."
"No, I'm not."
"You're drunk and you've had dt's."
"No." William Campbell held the sheet around his head. "Dear sheet," he said. He breathed against it gently. "Pretty sheet. You love me, don't you, sheet? It's all in the price of the room. Just like in Japan. No," he said. "Listen Billy, dear Sliding Billy, I have a surprise for you. I'm not drunk. I'm hopped to the eyes."
"No," said Mr. Turner.
"Take a look." William Campbell pulled up the right sleeve of his pyjama jacket under the sheet, then shoved the right forearm out. "Look at that." On the forearm, from just above the wrist to the elbow, were small blue circles around tiny dark blue punctures. The circles almost touched one another. "That's the new development," William Campbell said. "I drink a little now once in a while, just to drive the wolf out of the room."
"They got a cure for that, 'Sliding Billy'" Turner said.
"No," William Campbell said. "They haven't got a cure for anything."
"You can't just quit like that, Billy," Turner said. He sat on the bed.
"Be careful of my sheet," William Campbell said.
"You can't just quit at your age and take to pumping yourself full of that stuff just because you got in a jam."
"There's a law against it. If that's what you mean."
"No, I mean you got to fight it out."
Billy Campbell caressed the sheet with his lips and his tongue.
"Dear sheet," he said.
"I can kiss this sheet and see right through it at the same time.
"Cut it out about the sheet. You can't just take to that stuff, Billy."
William Campbell shut his eyes.
He was beginning to feel a slight nausea.
He knew that this nausea would increase steadily, without there ever being the relief of sickness, until something were done against it.
It was at this point that he suggested that Mr.
Turner have a drink.
Turner declined.
William Campbell took a drink from the bottle.
It was a temporary measure.
Turner watched him.
Turner had been in this room much longer than he should have been, he had many things to do; although living in daily association with people who used drugs, he had a horror of drugs, and he was very fond of William Campbell; he did not wish to leave him.
He was very sorry for him and he felt a cure might help.
He knew there were good cures in Kansas City.
But he had to go.
He stood up.
"Listen, Billy," William Campbell said, "I want to tell you something. You're called 'Sliding Billy.' That's because you can slide. I'm called just Billy. That's because I never could slide at all. I can't slide, Billy. I can't slide. It just catches. Every time I try it, it catches." He shut his eyes. "I can't slide, Billy. It's awful when you can't slide."
"Yes," said "Sliding Billy" Turner.
"Yes, what?" William Campbell looked at him.
"You were saying."
"No," said William Campbell. "I wasn't saying. It must have been a mistake."
"You were saying about sliding."
"No. It couldn't have been about sliding. But listen, Billy, and I'll tell you a secret. Stick to sheets, Billy. Keep away from women and horses and, and--" he stopped "--eagles, Billy. If you love horses you'll get horse-s--, and if you love eagles you'll get eagle-s--." He stopped and put his head under the sheet.
"I got to go," said "Sliding Billy" Turner.
"If you love women you'll get a dose," William Campbell said. "If you love horses----"
"Yes, you said that."
"Said what?"
"About horses and eagles."
"Oh, yes. And if you love sheets." He breathed on the sheet and stroked his nose against it. "I don't know about sheets," he said. "I just started to love this sheet."
"I have to go," Mr. Turner said. "I got a lot to do."
"That's all right," William Campbell said. "Everybody's got to go."
"I better go."
"All right, you go."
"Are you all right, Billy?"
"I was never so happy in my life."
"And you're all right?"
"I'm fine. You go along. I'll just lie here for a little while. Around noon I'll get up."
But when Mr.
Turner came up to William Campbell's room at noon William Campbell was sleeping and as Mr.
Turner was a man who knew what things in life were very valuable he did not wake him.
To-day Is Friday.
Three Roman soldiers are in a drinking-place at eleven o'clock at night.
There are barrels around the wall.
Behind the wooden counter is a Hebrew wine-seller.
The three Roman soldiers are a little cock-eyed.
1st Roman Soldier--You tried the red?.
2d Soldier--No, I ain't tried it.
1st Soldier--You better try it.
2d Soldier--All right, George, we'll have a round of the red.
Hebrew Wine-seller--Here you are, gentlemen.
You'll like that.
[He sets down an earthenware pitcher that he has filled from one of the casks.
] That's a nice little wine.
1st Soldier--Have a drink of it yourself.
[He turns to the third Roman soldier who is leaning on a barrel.
] What's the matter with you?.
3d Roman Soldier--I got a gut-ache.
2d Soldier--You've been drinking water.
1st Soldier--Try some of the red.
3d Soldier--I can't drink the damn stuff.
It makes my gut sour.
1st Soldier--You been out here too long.
3d Soldier--Hell, don't I know it?.
1st Soldier--Say, George, can't you give this gentleman something to fix up his stomach?.
Hebrew Wine-seller--I got it right here.
[The third Roman soldier tastes the cup that the wine-seller has mixed for him.
3d Soldier--Hey, what you put in that, camel chips?.
Wine-seller--You drink that right down, Lootenant.
That'll fix you up right.
3d Soldier--Well, I couldn't feel any worse.
1st Soldier--Take a chance on it.
George fixed me up fine the other day.
Wine-seller--You were in bad shape, Lootenant.
I know what fixes up a bad stomach.
[The third Roman soldier drinks the cup down.
3d Roman Soldier--Jesus Christ.
[He makes a face.
2d Soldier--That false alarm!.
1st Soldier--Oh, I don't know.
He was pretty good in there to-day.
2d Soldier--Why didn't he come down off the cross?.
1st Soldier--He didn't want to come down off the cross.
That's not his play.
2d Soldier--Show me a guy that doesn't want to come down off the cross.
1st Soldier--Aw, hell, you don't know anything about it.
Ask George there.
Did he want to come down off the cross, George?.
Wine-seller--I'll tell you, gentlemen, I wasn't out there.
It's a thing I haven't taken any interest in.
2d Soldier--Listen, I seen a lot of them--here and plenty of other places.
Any time you show me one that doesn't want to get down off the cross when the time comes--when the time comes, I mean--I'll climb right up with him.
1st Soldier--I thought he was pretty good in there to-day.
3d Soldier--He was all right.
2d Roman Soldier--You guys don't know what I'm talking about.
I'm not saying whether he was good or not.
What I mean is, when the time comes.
When they first start nailing him, there isn't none of them wouldn't stop it if they could.
1st Soldier--Didn't you follow it, George?.
Wine-seller--No, I didn't take any interest in it, Lootenant.
1st Soldier--I was surprised how he acted.
3d Soldier--The part I don't like is the nailing them on.
You know, that must get to you pretty bad.
2d Soldier--It isn't that that's so bad, as when they first lift 'em up.
[He makes a lifting gesture with his two palms together.
] When the weight starts to pull on 'em.
That's when it gets 'em.
3d Roman Soldier--It takes some of them pretty bad.
1st Soldier--Ain't I seen 'em? I seen plenty of them.
I tell you, he was pretty good in there to-day.
[The second Roman soldier smiles at the Hebrew wine-seller.
2d Soldier--You're a regular Christer, big boy.
1st Soldier--Sure, go on and kid him.
But listen while I tell you something.
He was pretty good in there to-day.
2d Soldier--What about some more wine?.
[The wine-seller looks up expectantly.
The third Roman soldier is sitting with his head down.
He does not look well.
3d Soldier--I don't want any more.
2d Soldier--Just for two, George.
[The wine-seller puts out a pitcher of wine, a size smaller than the last one.
He leans forward on the wooden counter.
1st Roman Soldier--You see his girl?.
2d Soldier--Wasn't I standing right by her?.
1st Soldier--She's a nice-looker.
2d Soldier--I knew her before he did.
[He winks at the wine-seller.
1st Soldier--I used to see her around the town.
2d Soldier--She used to have a lot of stuff.
He never brought her no good luck.
1st Soldier--Oh, he ain't lucky.
But he looked pretty good to me in there to-day.
2d Soldier--What become of his gang?.
1st Soldier--Oh, they faded out.
Just the women stuck by him.
2d Roman Soldier--They were a pretty yellow crowd.
When they seen him go up there they didn't want any of it.
1st Soldier--The women stuck all right.
2d Soldier--Sure, they stuck all right.
1st Roman Soldier--You see me slip the old spear into him?.
2d Roman Soldier--You'll get into trouble doing that some day.
1st Soldier--It was the least I could do for him.
I'll tell you he looked pretty good to me in there to-day.
Hebrew Wine-seller--Gentlemen, you know I got to close.
1st Roman Soldier--We'll have one more round.
2d Roman Soldier--What's the use? This stuff don't get you anywhere.
Come on, let's go.
1st Soldier--Just another round.
3d Roman Soldier--[Getting up from the barrel.
] No, come on.
Let's go.
I feel like hell to-night.
1st Soldier--Just one more.
2d Soldier--No, come on.
We're going to go.
Good-night, George.
Put it on the bill.
Wine-seller--Good-night, gentlemen.
[He looks a little worried.
] You couldn't let me have a little something on account, Lootenant?.
2d Roman Soldier--What the hell, George! Wednesday's pay-day.
Wine-seller--It's all right, Lootenant.
Good-night, gentlemen.
[The three Roman soldiers go out the door into the street.
[Outside in the street.
2d Roman Soldier--George is a kike just like all the rest of them.
1st Roman Soldier--Oh, George is a nice fella.
2d Soldier--Everybody's a nice fella to you to-night.
3d Roman Soldier--Come on, let's go up to the barracks.
I feel like hell to-night.
2d Soldier--You been out here too long.
3d Roman Soldier--No, it ain't just that.
I feel like hell.
2d Soldier--You been out here too long.
That's all.
CURTAIN.
Banal Story.
So he ate an orange, slowly spitting out the seeds.
Outside, the snow was turning to rain.
Inside, the electric stove seemed to give no heat and rising from his writing-table, he sat down upon the stove.
How good it felt! Here, at last, was life.
He reached for another orange.
Far away in Paris, Mascart had knocked Danny Frush cuckoo in the second round.
Far off in Mesopotamia, twenty-one feet of snow had fallen.
Across the world in distant Australia, the English cricketers were sharpening up their wickets.
There was Romance.
Patrons of the arts and letters have discovered The Forum, he read.
It is the guide, philosopher, and friend of the thinking minority.
Prize short-stories--will their authors write our best-sellers of to-morrow?.
You will enjoy these warm, homespun, American tales, bits of real life on the open ranch, in crowded tenement or comfortable home, and all with a healthy undercurrent of humor.
I must read them, he thought.
He read on.
Our children's children--what of them? Who of them? New means must be discovered to find room for us under the sun.
Shall this be done by war or can it be done by peaceful methods?.
Or will we all have to move to Canada?.
Our deepest convictions--will Science upset them? Our civilization--is it inferior to older orders of things?.
And meanwhile, in the far-off dripping jungles of Yucatan, sounded the chopping of the axes of the gum-choppers.
Do we want big men--or do we want them cultured? Take Joyce.
Take President Coolidge.
What star must our college students aim at? There is Jack Britton.
There is Dr.
Henry Van Dyke.
Can we reconcile the two? Take the case of Young Stribling.
And what of our daughters who must make their own Soundings? Nancy Hawthorne is obliged to make her own Soundings in the sea of life.
Bravely and sensibly she faces the problems which come to every girl of eighteen.
It was a splendid booklet.
Are you a girl of eighteen? Take the case of Joan of Arc.
Take the case of Bernard Shaw.
Take the case of Betsy Ross.
Think of these things in 1925--Was there a risqué page in Puritan history? Were there two sides to Pocahontas? Did he have a fourth dimension?.
Are modern paintings--and poetry--Art? Yes and No.
Take Picasso.
Have tramps codes of conduct? Send your mind adventuring.
There is Romance everywhere.
Forum writers talk to the point, are possessed of humor and wit.
But they do not try to be smart and are never long-winded.
Live the full life of the mind, exhilarated by new ideas, intoxicated by the Romance of the unusual.
He laid down the booklet.
And meanwhile, stretched flat on a bed in a darkened room in his house in Triana, Manuel Garcia Maera lay with a tube in each lung, drowning with the pneumonia.
All the papers in Andalucia devoted special supplements to his death, which had been expected for some days.
Men and boys bought full-length colored pictures of him to remember him by, and lost the picture they had of him in their memories by looking at the lithographs.
Bull-fighters were very relieved he was dead, because he did always in the bull-ring the things they could only do sometimes.
They all marched in the rain behind his coffin and there were one hundred and forty-seven bull-fighters followed him out to the cemetery, where they buried him in the tomb next to Joselito.
After the funeral every one sat in the cafés out of the rain, and many colored pictures of Maera were sold to men who rolled them up and put them away in their pockets.
Now I Lay Me.
That night we lay on the floor in the room and I listened to the silk-worms eating.
The silk-worms fed in racks of mulberry leaves and all night you could hear them eating and a dropping sound in the leaves.
I myself did not want to sleep because I had been living for a long time with the knowledge that if I ever shut my eyes in the dark and let myself go, my soul would go out of my body.
I had been that way for a long time, ever since I had been blown up at night and felt it go out of me and go off and then come back.
I tried never to think about it, but it had started to go since, in the nights, just at the moment of going off to sleep, and I could only stop it by a very great effort.
So while now I am fairly sure that it would not really have gone out, yet then, that summer, I was unwilling to make the experiment.
I had different ways of occupying myself while I lay awake.
I would think of a trout stream I had fished along when I was a boy and fish its whole length very carefully in my mind; fishing very carefully under all the logs, all the turns of the bank, the deep holes and the clear shallow stretches, sometimes catching trout and sometimes losing them.
I would stop fishing at noon to eat my lunch; sometimes on a log over the stream; sometimes on a high bank under a tree, and I always ate my lunch very slowly and watched the stream below me while I ate.
Often I ran out of bait because I would take only ten worms with me in a tobacco tin when I started.
When I had used them all I had to find more worms, and sometimes it was very difficult digging in the bank of the stream where the cedar trees kept out the sun and there was no grass but only the bare moist earth and often I could find no worms.
Always though I found some kind of bait, but one time in the swamp I could find no bait at all and had to cut up one of the trout I had caught and use him for bait.
Sometimes I found insects in the swamp meadows, in the grass or under ferns, and used them.
There were beetles and insects with legs like grass stems, and grubs in old rotten logs; white grubs with brown pinching heads that would not stay on the hook and emptied into nothing in the cold water, and wood ticks under logs where sometimes I found angle-worms that slipped into the ground as soon as the log was raised.
Once I used a salamander from under an old log.
The salamander was very small and neat and agile and a lovely color.
He had tiny feet that tried to hold on to the hook, and after that one time I never used a salamander, although I found them very often.
Nor did I use crickets, because of the way they acted about the hook.
Sometimes the stream ran through an open meadow, and in the dry grass I would catch grasshoppers and use them for bait and sometimes I would catch grasshoppers and toss them into the stream and watch them float along swimming on the stream and circling on the surface as the current took them and then disappear as a trout rose.
Sometimes I would fish four or five different streams in the night; starting as near as I could get to their source and fishing them down stream.
When I had finished too quickly and the time did not go, I would fish the stream over again, starting where it emptied into the lake and fishing back up stream, trying for all the trout I had missed coming down.
Some nights too I made up streams, and some of them were very exciting, and it was like being awake and dreaming.
Some of those streams I still remember and think that I have fished in them, and they are confused with streams I really know.
I gave them all names and went to them on the train and sometimes walked for miles to get to them.
But some nights I could not fish, and on those nights I was cold-awake and said my prayers over and over and tried to pray for all the people I had ever known.
That took up a great amount of time, for if you try to remember all the people you have ever known, going back to the earliest thing you remember--which was, with me, the attic of the house where I was born and my mother and father's wedding-cake in a tin box hanging from one of the rafters, and, in the attic, jars of snakes and other specimens that my father had collected as a boy and preserved in alcohol, the alcohol sunken in the jars so the backs of some of the snakes and specimens were exposed and had turned white--if you thought back that far, you remembered a great many people.
If you prayed for all of them, saying a Hail Mary and an Our Father for each one, it took a long time and finally it would be light, and then you could go to sleep, if you were in a place where you could sleep in the daylight.
On those nights I tried to remember everything that had ever happened to me, starting with just before I went to the war and remembering back from one thing to another.
I found I could only remember back to that attic in my grandfather's house.
Then I would start there and remember this way again, until I reached the war.
I remembered, after my grandfather died we moved away from that house and to a new house designed and built by my mother.
Many things that were not to be moved were burned in the back-yard and I remember those jars from the attic being thrown in the fire, and how they popped in the heat and the fire flamed up from the alcohol.
I remember the snakes burning in the fire in the back-yard.
But there were no people in that, only things.
I could not remember who burned the things even, and I would go on until I came to people and then stop and pray for them.
About the new house I remembered how my mother was always cleaning things out and making a good clearance.
One time when my father was away on a hunting trip she made a good thorough cleaning out in the basement and burned everything that should not have been there.
When my father came home and got down from his buggy and hitched the horse, the fire was still burning in the road beside the house.
I went out to meet him.
He handed me his shotgun and looked at the fire.
"What's this?" he asked.
"I've been cleaning out the basement, dear," my mother said from the porch. She was standing there smiling, to meet him. My father looked at the fire and kicked at something. Then he leaned over and picked something out of the ashes. "Get a rake, Nick," he said to me. I went to the basement and brought a rake and my father raked very carefully in the ashes. He raked out stone axes and stone skinning knives and tools for making arrow-heads and pieces of pottery and many arrow-heads. They had all been blackened and chipped by the fire. My father raked them all out very carefully and spread them on the grass by the road. His shotgun in its leather case and his game-bags were on the grass where he had left them when he stepped down from the buggy.
"Take the gun and the bags in the house, Nick, and bring me a paper," he said. My mother had gone inside the house. I took the shotgun, which was heavy to carry and banged against my legs, and the two game-bags and started toward the house. "Take them one at a time," my father said. "Don't try and carry too much at once." I put down the game-bags and took in the shotgun and brought out a newspaper from the pile in my father's office. My father spread all the blackened, chipped stone implements on the paper and then wrapped them up. "The best arrow-heads went all to pieces," he said. He walked into the house with the paper package and I stayed outside on the grass with the two game-bags. After a while I took them in. In remembering that, there were only two people, so I would pray for them both.
Some nights, though, I could not remember my prayers even.
I could only get as far as "On earth as it is in heaven" and then have to start all over and be absolutely unable to get past that.
Then I would have to recognize that I could not remember and give up saying my prayers that night and try something else.
So on some nights I would try to remember all the animals in the world by name and then the birds and then fishes and then countries and cities and then kinds of food and the names of all the streets I could remember in Chicago, and when I could not remember anything at all any more I would just listen.
And I do not remember a night on which you could not hear things.
If I could have a light I was not afraid to sleep, because I knew my soul would only go out of me if it were dark.
So, of course, many nights I was where I could have a light and then I slept because I was nearly always tired and often very sleepy.
And I am sure many times too that I slept without knowing it--but I never slept knowing it, and on this night I listened to the silk-worms.
You can hear silk-worms eating very clearly in the night and I lay with my eyes open and listened to them.
There was only one other person in the room and he was awake too.
I listened to him being awake, for a long time.
He could not lie as quietly as I could because, perhaps, he had not had as much practice being awake.
We were lying on blankets spread over straw and when he moved the straw was noisy, but the silk-worms were not frightened by any noise we made and ate on steadily.
There were the noises of night seven kilometres behind the lines outside but they were different from the small noises inside the room in the dark.
The other man in the room tried lying quietly.
Then he moved again.
I moved too, so he would know I was awake.
He had lived ten years in Chicago.
They had taken him for a soldier in nineteen fourteen when he had come back to visit his family, and they had given him to me for an orderly because he spoke English.
I heard him listening, so I moved again in the blankets.
"Can't you sleep, Signor Tenente?" he asked.
"No."
"I can't sleep, either."
"What's the matter?"
"I don't know. I can't sleep."
"You feel all right?"
"Sure. I feel good. I just can't sleep."
"You want to talk a while?" I asked.
"Sure. What can you talk about in this damn place."
"This place is pretty good," I said.
"Sure," he said. "It's all right."
"Tell me about out in Chicago," I said.
"Oh," he said, "I told you all that once."
"Tell me about how you got married."
"I told you that."
"Was the letter you got Monday--from her?"
"Sure. She writes me all the time. She's making good money with the place."
"You'll have a nice place when you go back."
"Sure. She runs it fine. She's making a lot of money."
"Don't you think we'll wake them up, talking?" I asked.
"No. They can't hear. Anyway, they sleep like pigs. I'm different," he said. "I'm nervous."
"Talk quiet," I said. "Want a smoke?"
We smoked skilfully in the dark.
"You don't smoke much, Signor Tenente."
"No. I've just about cut it out."
"Well," he said, "it don't do you any good and I suppose you get so you don't miss it. Did you ever hear a blind man won't smoke because he can't see the smoke come out?"
"I don't believe it."
"I think it's all bull, myself," he said. "I just heard it somewhere. You know how you hear things."
We were both quiet and I listened to the silk-worms.
"You hear those damn silk-worms?" he asked. "You can hear them chew."
"It's funny," I said.
"Say, Signor Tenente, is there something really the matter that you can't sleep? I never see you sleep. You haven't slept nights ever since I been with you."
"I don't know, John," I said. "I got in pretty bad shape along early last spring and at night it bothers me."
"Just like I am," he said. "I shouldn't have ever got in this war. I'm too nervous."
"Maybe it will get better."
"Say, Signor Tenente, what did you get in this war for, anyway?"
"I don't know, John. I wanted to, then."
"Wanted to," he said. "That's a hell of a reason."
"We oughtn't to talk out loud," I said.
"They sleep just like pigs," he said. "They can't understand the English language, anyway. They don't know a damn thing. What are you going to do when it's over and we go back to the States?"
"I'll get a job on a paper."
"In Chicago?"
"Maybe."
"Do you ever read what this fellow Brisbane writes? My wife cuts it out for me and sends it to me."
"Sure."
"Did you ever meet him?"
"No, but I've seen him."
"I'd like to meet that fellow. He's a fine writer. My wife don't read English but she takes the paper just like when I was home and she cuts out the editorials and the sport page and sends them to me."
"How are your kids?"
"They're fine. One of the girls is in the fourth grade now. You know, Signor Tenente, if I didn't have the kids I wouldn't be your orderly now. They'd have made me stay in the line all the time."
"I'm glad you've got them."
"So am I. They're fine kids but I want a boy. Three girls and no boy. That's a hell of a note."
"Why don't you try and go to sleep."
"No, I can't sleep now. I'm wide awake now, Signor Tenente. Say, I'm worried about you not sleeping though."
"It'll be all right, John."
"Imagine a young fellow like you not to sleep."
"I'll get all right. It just takes a while."
"You got to get all right. A man can't get along that don't sleep. Do you worry about anything? You got anything on your mind?"
"No, John, I don't think so."
"You ought to get married, Signor Tenente. Then you wouldn't worry."
"I don't know."
"You ought to get married. Why don't you pick out some nice Italian girl with plenty of money. You could get any one you want. You're young and you got good decorations and you look nice. You been wounded a couple of times."
"I can't talk the language well enough."
"You talk it fine. To hell with talking the language. You don't have to talk to them. Marry them."
"I'll think about it."
"You know some girls, don't you?"
"Sure."
"Well, you marry the one with the most money. Over here, the way they're brought up, they'll all make you a good wife."
"I'll think about it."
"Don't think about it, Signor Tenente. Do it."
"All right."
"A man ought to be married. You'll never regret it. Every man ought to be married."
"All right," I said. "Let's try and sleep a while."
"All right, Signor Tenente. I'll try it again. But you remember what I said."
"I'll remember it," I said. "Now let's sleep a while, John."
"All right," he said. "I hope you sleep, Signor Tenente."
I heard him roll in his blankets on the straw and then he was very quiet and I listened to him breathing regularly.
Then he started to snore.
I listened to him snore for a long time and then I stopped listening to him snore and listened to the silk-worms eating.
They ate steadily, making a dropping in the leaves.
I had a new thing to think about and I lay in the dark with my eyes open and thought of all the girls I had ever known and what kind of wives they would make.
It was a very interesting thing to think about and for a while it killed off trout-fishing and interfered with my prayers.
Finally, though, I went back to trout-fishing, because I found that I could remember all the streams and there was always something new about them, while the girls, after I had thought about them a few times, blurred and I could not call them into my mind and finally they all blurred and all became rather the same and I gave up thinking about them almost altogether.
But I kept on with my prayers and I prayed very often for John in the nights and his class was removed from active service before the October offensive.
I was glad he was not there, because he would have been a great worry to me.
He came to the hospital in Milan to see me several months after and was very disappointed that I had not yet married, and I know he would feel very badly if he knew that, so far, I have never married.
He was going back to America and he was very certain about marriage and knew it would fix up everything.
AFTER THE STORM.
It wasn't about anything, something about making punch, and then we started fighting and I slipped and he had me down kneeling on my chest and choking me with both hands like he was trying to kill me and all the time I was trying to get the knife out of my pocket to cut him loose.
Everybody was too drunk to pull him off me.
He was choking me and hammering my head on the floor and I got the knife out and opened it up; and I cut the muscle right across his arm and he let go of me.
He couldn't have held on if he wanted to.
Then he rolled and hung onto that arm and started to cry and I said:.
"What the hell you want to choke me for?"
I'd have killed him.
I couldn't swallow for a week.
He hurt my throat bad.
Well, I went out of there and there were plenty of them with him and some come out after me and I made a turn and was down by the docks and I met a fellow and he said somebody killed a man up the street.
I said "Who killed him?" and he said "I don't know who killed him but he's dead all right," and it was dark and there was water standing in the street and no lights and windows broke and boats all up in the town and trees blown down and everything all blown and I got a skiff and went out and found my boat where I had her inside of Mango Key and she was all right only she was full of water.
So I bailed her out and pumped her out and there was a moon but plenty of clouds and still plenty rough and I took it down along; and when it was daylight I was off Eastern Harbor.
Brother, that was some storm.
I was the first boat out and you never saw water like that was.
It was just as white as a lye barrel and coming from Eastern Harbor to Sou'west Key you couldn't recognize the shore.
There was a big channel blown right out through the middle of the beach.
Trees and all blown out and a channel cut through and all the water white as chalk and everything on it; branches and whole trees and dead birds, and all floating.
Inside the keys were all the pelicans in the world and all kinds of birds flying.
They must have gone inside there when they knew it was coming.
I lay at Sou'west Key a day and nobody came after me.
I was the first boat out and I seen a spar floating and I knew there must be a wreck and I started out to look for her.
I found her.
She was a three-masted schooner and I could just see the stumps of her spars out of water.
She was in too deep water and I didn't get anything off of her.
So I went on looking for something else.
I had the start on all of them and I knew I ought to get whatever there was.
I went on down over the sand-bars from where I left that three-masted schooner and I didn't find anything and I went on a long way.
I was way out toward the quicksands and I didn't find anything so I went on.
Then when I was in sight of the Rebecca Light I saw all kinds of birds making over something and I headed over for them to see what it was and there was a cloud of birds all right.
I could see something looked like a spar up out of water and when I got over close the birds all went up in the air and stayed all around me.
The water was clear out there and there was a spar of some kind sticking out just above the water and when I come up close to it I saw it was all dark under water like a long shadow and I came right over it and there under water was a liner; just lying there all under water as big as the whole world.
I drifted over her in the boat.
She lay on her side and the stern was deep down.
The port holes were all shut tight and I could see the glass shine in the water and the whole of her; the biggest boat I ever saw in my life laying there and I went along the whole length of her and then I went over and anchored and I had the skiff on the deck forward and I shoved it down into the water and sculled over with the birds all around me.
I had a water glass like we use sponging and my hand shook so I could hardly hold it.
All the port holes were shut that you could see going along over her but way down below near the bottom something must have been open because there were pieces of things floating out all the time.
You couldn't tell what they were.
Just pieces.
That's what the birds were after.
You never saw so many birds.
They were all around me; crazy yelling.
I could see everything sharp and clear.
I could see her rounded over and she looked a mile long under the water.
She was lying on a clear white bank of sand and the spar was a sort of foremast or some sort of tackle that slanted out of water the way she was laying on her side.
Her bow wasn't very far under.
I could stand on the letters of her name on her bow and my head was just out of water.
But the nearest port hole was twelve feet down.
I could just reach it with the grains pole and I tried to break it with that but I couldn't.
The glass was too stout.
So I sculled back to the boat and got a wrench and lashed it to the end of the grains pole and I couldn't break it.
There I was looking down through the glass at that liner with everything in her and I was the first one to her and I couldn't get into her.
She must have had five million dollars worth in her.
It made me shaky to think how much she must have in her.
Inside the port hole that was closest I could see something but I couldn't make it out through the water glass.
I couldn't do any good with the grains pole and I took off my clothes and stood and took a couple of deep breaths and dove over off the stern with the wrench in my hand and swam down.
I could hold on for a second to the edge of the port hole and I could see in and there was a woman inside with her hair floating all out.
I could see her floating plain and I hit the glass twice with the wrench hard and I heard the noise clink in my ears but it wouldn't break and I had to come up.
I hung onto the dinghy and got my breath and then I climbed in and took a couple of breaths and dove again.
I swam down and took hold of the edge of the port hole with my fingers and held it and hit the glass as hard as I could with the wrench.
I could see the woman floated in the water through the glass.
Her hair was tied once close to her head and it floated all out in the water.
I could see the rings on one of her hands.
She was right up close to the port hole and I hit the glass twice and I didn't even crack it.
When I came up I thought I wouldn't make it to the top before I'd have to breathe.
I went down once more and I cracked the glass, only cracked it, and when I came up my nose was bleeding and I stood on the bow of the liner with my bare feet on the letters of her name and my head just out and rested there and then I swam over to the skiff and pulled up into it and sat there waiting for my head to stop aching and looking down into the water glass, but I bled so I had to wash out the water glass.
Then I lay back in the skiff and held my hand under my nose to stop it and I lay there with my head back looking up and there was a million birds above and all around.
When I quit bleeding I took another look through the glass and then I sculled over to the boat to try and find something heavier than the wrench but I couldn't find a thing; not even a sponge hook.
I went back and the water was clearer all the time and you could see everything that floated out over that white bank of sand.
I looked for sharks but there weren't any.
You could have seen a shark a long way away.
The water was so clear and the sand white.
There was a grapple for an anchor on the skiff and I cut it off and went overboard and down with it.
It carried me right down and past the port hole and I grabbed and couldn't hold anything and went on down and down, sliding along the curved side of her.
I had to let go of the grapple.
I heard it bump once and it seemed like a year before I came up through to the top of the water.
The skiff was floated away with the tide and I swam over to her with my nose bleeding in the water while I swam and I was plenty glad there weren't sharks; but I was tired.
My head felt cracked open and I lay in the skiff and rested and then I sculled back.
It was getting along in the afternoon.
I went down once more with the wrench and it didn't do any good.
That wrench was too light.
It wasn't any good diving unless you had a big hammer or something heavy enough to do good.
Then I lashed the wrench to the grains pole again and I watched through the water glass and pounded on the glass and hammered until the wrench came off and I saw it in the glass, clear and sharp, go sliding down along her and then off and down to the quicksand and go in.
Then I couldn't do a thing.
The wrench was gone and I'd lost the grapple so I sculled back to the boat.
I was too tired to get the skiff aboard and the sun was pretty low.
The birds were all pulling out and leaving her and I headed for Sou'west Key towing the skiff and the birds going on ahead of me and behind me.
I was plenty tired.
That night it came on to blow and it blew for a week.
You couldn't get out to her.
They come out from town and told me the fellow I'd had to cut was all right except for his arm and I went back to town and they put me under five hundred dollar bond.
It came out all right because some of them, friends of mine, swore he was after me with an ax, but by the time we got back out to her the Greeks had blown her open and cleaned her out.
They got the safe out with dynamite.
Nobody ever knows how much they got.
She carried gold and they got it all.
They stripped her clean.
I found her and I never got a nickel out of her.
It was a hell of a thing all right.
They say she was just outside of Havana harbor when the hurricane hit and she couldn't get in or the owners wouldn't let the captain chance coming in; they say he wanted to try; so she had to go with it and in the dark they were running with it trying to go through the gulf between Rebecca and Tortugas when she struck on the quicksands.
Maybe her rudder was carried away.
Maybe they weren't even steering.
But anyway they couldn't have known they were quicksands and when she struck the captain must have ordered them to open up the ballast tanks so she'd lay solid.
But it was quicksand she'd hit and when they opened the tanks she went in stern first and then over on her beam ends.
There were four hundred and fifty passengers and the crew on board of her and they must all have been aboard of her when I found her.
They must have opened the tanks as soon as she struck and the minute she settled on it the quicksands took her down.
Then her boilers must have burst and that must have been what made those pieces that came out.
It was funny there weren't any sharks though.
There wasn't a fish.
I could have seen them on that clear white sand.
Plenty of fish now though; jewfish, the biggest kind.
The biggest part of her's under the sand now but they live inside of her; the biggest kind of jewfish.
Some weigh three to four hundred pounds.
Sometime we'll go out and get some.
You can see the Rebecca light from where she is.
They've got a buoy on her now.
She's right at the end of the quicksand right at the edge of the gulf.
She only missed going through by about a hundred yards.
In the dark in the storm they just missed it; raining the way it was they couldn't have seen the Rebecca.
Then they're not used to that sort of thing.
The captain of a liner isn't used to scudding that way.
They have a course and they tell me they set some sort of a compass and it steers itself.
They probably didn't know where they were when they ran with that blow but they come close to making it.
Maybe they'd lost the rudder though.
Anyway there wasn't another thing for them to hit till they'd get to Mexico once they were in that gulf.
Must have been something though when they struck in that rain and wind and he told them to open her tanks.
Nobody could have been on deck in that blow and rain.
Everybody must have been below.
They couldn't have lived on deck.
There must have been some scenes inside all right because you know she settled fast.
I saw that wrench go into the sand.
The captain couldn't have known it was quicksand when she struck unless he knew these waters.
He just knew it wasn't rock.
He must have seen it all up in the bridge.
He must have known what it was about when she settled.
I wonder how fast she made it.
I wonder if the mate was there with him.
Do you think they stayed inside the bridge or do you think they took it outside? They never found any bodies.
Not a one.
Nobody floating.
They float a long way with life belts too.
They must have took it inside.
Well, the Greeks got it all.
Everything.
They must have come fast all right.
They picked her clean.
First there was the birds, then me, then the Greeks, and even the birds got more out of her than I did.
A CLEAN, WELL-LIGHTED PLACE.
It was late and every one had left the café except an old man who sat in the shadow the leaves of the tree made against the electric light.
In the daytime the street was dusty, but at night the dew settled the dust and the old man liked to sit late because he was deaf and now at night it was quiet and he felt the difference.
The two waiters inside the café knew that the old man was a little drunk, and while he was a good client they knew that if he became too drunk he would leave without paying, so they kept watch on him.
"Last week he tried to commit suicide," one waiter said.
"Why?"
"He was in despair."
"What about?"
"Nothing."
"How do you know it was nothing?"
"He has plenty of money."
They sat together at a table that was close against the wall near the door of the café and looked at the terrace where the tables were all empty except where the old man sat in the shadow of the leaves of the tree that moved slightly in the wind.
A girl and a soldier went by in the street.
The street light shone on the brass number on his collar.
The girl wore no head covering and hurried beside him.
"The guard will pick him up," one waiter said.
"What does it matter if he gets what he's after?"
"He had better get off the street now. The guard will get him. They went by five minutes ago."
The old man sitting in the shadow rapped on his saucer with his glass.
The younger waiter went over to him.
"What do you want?"
The old man looked at him.
"Another brandy," he said.
"You'll be drunk," the waiter said. The old man looked at him. The waiter went away.
"He'll stay all night," he said to his colleague. "I'm sleepy now. I never get into bed before three o'clock. He should have killed himself last week."
The waiter took the brandy bottle and another saucer from the counter inside the café and marched out to the old man's table.
He put down the saucer and poured the glass full of brandy.
"You should have killed yourself last week," he said to the deaf man. The old man motioned with his finger. "A little more," he said. The waiter poured on into the glass so that the brandy slopped over and ran down the stem into the top saucer of the pile. "Thank you," the old man said. The waiter took the bottle back inside the café. He sat down at the table with his colleague again.
"He's drunk now," he said.
"He's drunk every night."
"What did he want to kill himself for?"
"How should I know."
"How did he do it?"
"He hung himself with a rope."
"Who cut him down?"
"His niece."
"Why did they do it?"
"Fear for his soul."
"How much money has he got?"
"He's got plenty."
"He must be eighty years old."
"Anyway I should say he was eighty."
"I wish he would go home. I never get to bed before three o'clock. What kind of hour is that to go to bed?"
"He stays up because he likes it."
"He's lonely. I'm not lonely. I have a wife waiting in bed for me."
"He had a wife once too."
"A wife would be no good to him now."
"You can't tell. He might be better with a wife."
"His niece looks after him."
"I know. You said she cut him down."
"I wouldn't want to be that old. An old man is a nasty thing."
"Not always. This old man is clean. He drinks without spilling. Even now, drunk. Look at him."
"I don't want to look at him. I wish he would go home. He has no regard for those who must work."
The old man looked from his glass across the square, then over at the waiters.
"Another brandy," he said, pointing to his glass. The waiter who was in a hurry came over.
"Finished," he said, speaking with that omission of syntax stupid people employ when talking to drunken people or foreigners. "No more tonight. Close now."
"Another," said the old man.
"No. Finished." The waiter wiped the edge of the table with a towel and shook his head.
The old man stood up, slowly counted the saucers, took a leather coin purse from his pocket and paid for the drinks, leaving half a peseta tip.
The waiter watched him go down the street, a very old man walking unsteadily but with dignity.
"Why didn't you let him stay and drink?" the unhurried waiter asked. They were putting up the shutters. "It is not half-past two."
"I want to go home to bed."
"What is an hour?"
"More to me than to him."
"An hour is the same."
"You talk like an old man yourself. He can buy a bottle and drink at home."
"It's not the same."
"No, it is not," agreed the waiter with a wife. He did not wish to be unjust. He was only in a hurry.
"And you? You have no fear of going home before your usual hour?"
"Are you trying to insult me?"
"No, hombre, only to make a joke."
"No," the waiter who was in a hurry said, rising from pulling down the metal shutters. "I have confidence. I am all confidence."
"You have youth, confidence, and a job," the older waiter said. "You have everything."
"And what do you lack?"
"Everything but work."
"You have everything I have."
"No. I have never had confidence and I am not young."
"Come on. Stop talking nonsense and lock up."
"I am of those who like to stay late at the café," the older waiter said. "With all those who do not want to go to bed. With all those who need a light for the night."
"I want to go home and into bed."
"We are of two different kinds," the older waiter said. He was now dressed to go home. "It is not only a question of youth and confidence although those things are very beautiful. Each night I am reluctant to close up because there may be some one who needs the café."
"Hombre, there are bodegas open all night long."
"You do not understand. This is a clean and pleasant café. It is well lighted. The light is very good and also, now, there are shadows of the leaves."
"Good night," said the younger waiter.
"Good night," the other said. Turning off the electric light he continued the conversation with himself. It is the light of course but it is necessary that the place be clean and pleasant. You do not want music. Certainly you do not want music. Nor can you stand before a bar with dignity although that is all that is provided for these hours. What did he fear? It was not fear or dread. It was a nothing that he knew too well. It was all a nothing and a man was nothing too. It was only that and light was all it needed and a certain cleanness and order. Some lived in it and never felt it but he knew it all was nada y pues nada y nada y pues nada. Our nada who art in nada, nada be thy name thy kingdom nada thy will be nada in nada as it is in nada. Give us this nada our daily nada and nada us our nada as we nada our nadas and nada us not into nada but deliver us from nada; pues nada. Hail nothing full of nothing, nothing is with thee. He smiled and stood before a bar with a shining steam pressure coffee machine.
"What's yours?" asked the barman.
"Nada."
"Otro loco mas," said the barman and turned away.
"A little cup," said the waiter.
The barman poured it for him.
"The light is very bright and pleasant but the bar is unpolished," the waiter said.
The barman looked at him but did not answer.
It was too late at night for conversation.
"You want another copita?" the barman asked.
"No, thank you," said the waiter and went out. He disliked bars and bodegas. A clean, well-lighted café was a very different thing. Now, without thinking further, he would go home to his room. He would lie in the bed and finally, with daylight, he would go to sleep. After all, he said to himself, it is probably only insomnia. Many must have it.
THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD.
When he saw us come in the door the bartender looked up and then reached over and put the glass covers on the two free-lunch bowls.
"Give me a beer," I said. He drew it, cut the top off with the spatula and then held the glass in his hand. I put the nickel on the wood and he slid the beer toward me.
"What's yours?" he said to Tom.
"Beer."
He drew that beer and cut it off and when he saw the money he pushed the beer across to Tom.
"What's the matter?" Tom asked.
The bartender didn't answer him.
He just looked over our heads and said, "What's yours?" to a man who'd come in.
"Rye," the man said. The bartender put out the bottle and glass and a glass of water.
Tom reached over and took the glass off the free-lunch bowl.
It was a bowl of pickled pig's feet and there was a wooden thing that worked like a scissors, with two wooden forks at the end to pick them up with.
"No," said the bartender and put the glass cover back on the bowl. Tom held the wooden scissors fork in his hand. "Put it back," said the bartender.
"You know where," said Tom.
The bartender reached a hand forward under the bar, watching us both.
I put fifty cents on the wood and he straightened up.
"What was yours?" he said.
"Beer," I said, and before he drew the beer he uncovered both the bowls.
"Your goddam pig's feet stink," Tom said, and spit what he had in his mouth on the floor. The bartender didn't say anything. The man who had drunk the rye paid and went out without looking back.
"You stink yourself," the bartender said. "All you punks stink."
"He says we're punks," Tommy said to me.
"Listen," I said. "Let's get out."
"You punks clear the hell out of here," the bartender said.
"I said we were going out," I said. "It wasn't your idea."
"We'll be back," Tommy said.
"No you won't," the bartender told him.
"Tell him how wrong he is," Tom turned to me.
"Come on," I said.
Outside it was good and dark.
"What the hell kind of place is this?" Tommy said.
"I don't know," I said. "Let's go down to the station."
We'd come in that town at one end and we were going out the other.
It smelled of hides and tan bark and the big piles of sawdust.
It was getting dark as we came in, and now that it was dark it was cold and the puddles of water in the road were freezing at the edges.
Down at the station there were five whores waiting for the train to come in, and six white men and four Indians.
It was crowded and hot from the stove and full of stale smoke.
As we came in nobody was talking and the ticket window was down.
"Shut the door, can't you?" somebody said.
I looked to see who said it.
It was one of the white men.
He wore stagged trousers and lumbermen's rubbers and a mackinaw shirt like the others, but he had no cap and his face was white and his hands were white and thin.
"Aren't you going to shut it?"
"Sure," I said, and shut it.
"Thank you," he said. One of the other men snickered.
"Ever interfere with a cook?" he said to me.
"No."
"You interfere with this one," he looked at the cook. "He likes it."
The cook looked away from him holding his lips tight together.
"He puts lemon juice on his hands," the man said. "He wouldn't get them in dishwater for anything. Look how white they are."
One of the whores laughed out loud.
She was the biggest whore I ever saw in my life and the biggest woman.
And she had on one of those silk dresses that change colors.
There were two other whores that were nearly as big but the big one must have weighed three hundred and fifty pounds.
You couldn't believe she was real when you looked at her.
All three had those changeable silk dresses.
They sat side by side on the bench.
They were huge.
The other two were just ordinary looking whores, peroxide blondes.
"Look at his hands," the man said and nodded his head at the cook. The whore laughed again and shook all over.
The cook turned and said to her quickly, "You big disgusting mountain of flesh.
She just kept on laughing and shaking.
"Oh, my Christ," she said. She had a nice voice. "Oh, my sweet Christ."
The two other whores, the big ones, acted very quiet and placid as though they didn't have much sense, but they were big, nearly as big as the biggest one.
They'd have both gone well over two hundred and fifty pounds.
The other two were dignified.
Of the men, besides the cook and the one who talked, there were two other lumberjacks, one that listened, interested but bashful, and the other that seemed getting ready to say something, and two Swedes.
Two Indians were sitting down at the end of the bench and one standing up against the wall.
The man who was getting ready to say something spoke to me very low, "Must be like getting on top of a hay mow.
I laughed and said it to Tommy.
"I swear to Christ I've never been anywhere like this," he said. "Look at the three of them." Then the cook spoke up.
"How old are you boys?"
"I'm ninety-six and he's sixty-nine," Tommy said.
"Ho! Ho! Ho!" the big whore shook with laughing. She had a really pretty voice. The other whores didn't smile.
"Oh, can't you be decent?" the cook said. "I asked just to be friendly."
"We're seventeen and nineteen," I said.
"What's the matter with you?" Tommy turned to me.
"That's all right."
"You can call me Alice," the big whore said and then she began to shake again.
"Is that your name?" Tommy asked.
"Sure," she said. "Alice. Isn't it?" she turned to the man who sat by the cook.
"Alice. That's right."
"That's the sort of name you'd have," the cook said.
"It's my real name," Alice said.
"What's the other girls' names?" Tom asked.
"Hazel and Ethel," Alice said. Hazel and Ethel smiled. They weren't very bright.
"What's your name?" I said to one of the blondes.
"Frances," she said.
"Frances what?"
"Frances Wilson. What's it to you?"
"What's yours?" I asked the other one.
"Oh, don't be fresh," she said.
"He just wants us all to be friends," the man who talked said. "Don't you want to be friends?"
"No," the peroxide one said. "Not with you."
"She's just a spitfire," the man said. "A regular little spitfire."
The one blonde looked at the other and shook her head.
"Goddamned mossbacks," she said.
Alice commenced to laugh again and to shake all over.
"There's nothing funny," the cook said. "You all laugh but there's nothing funny. You two young lads; where are you bound for?"
"Where are you going yourself?" Tom asked him.
"I want to go to Cadillac," the cook said. "Have you ever been there? My sister lives there."
"He's a sister himself," the man in the stagged trousers said.
"Can't you stop that sort of thing?" the cook asked. "Can't we speak decently?"
"Cadillac is where Steve Ketchel came from and where Ad Wolgast is from," the shy man said.
"Steve Ketchel," one of the blondes said in a high voice as though the name had pulled a trigger in her. "His own father shot and killed him. Yes, by Christ, his own father. There aren't any more men like Steve Ketchel."
"Wasn't his name Stanley Ketchel?" asked the cook.
"Oh, shut up," said the blonde. "What do you know about Steve? Stanley. He was no Stanley. Steve Ketchel was the finest and most beautiful man that ever lived. I never saw a man as clean and as white and as beautiful as Steve Ketchel. There never was a man like that. He moved just like a tiger and he was the finest, free-est, spender that ever lived."
"Did you know him?" one of the men asked.
"Did I know him? Did I know him? Did I love him? You ask me that? I knew him like you know nobody in the world and I loved him like you love God. He was the greatest, finest, whitest, most beautiful man that ever lived, Steve Ketchel, and his own father shot him down like a dog."
"Were you out on the coast with him?"
"No. I knew him before that. He was the only man I ever loved."
Every one was very respectful to the peroxide blonde, who said all this in a high stagey way, but Alice was beginning to shake again.
I felt it sitting by her.
"You should have married him," the cook said.
"I wouldn't hurt his career," the peroxide blonde said. "I wouldn't be a drawback to him. A wife wasn't what he needed. Oh, my God, what a man he was."
"That was a fine way to look at it," the cook said. "Didn't Jack Johnson knock him out though?"
"It was a trick," Peroxide said. "That big dinge took him by surprise. He'd just knocked Jack Johnson down, the big black bastard. That nigger beat him by a fluke."
The ticket window went up and the three Indians went over to it.
"Steve knocked him down," Peroxide said. "He turned to smile at me."
"I thought you said you weren't on the coast," some one said.
"I went out just for that fight. Steve turned to smile at me and that black son of a bitch from hell jumped up and hit him by surprise. Steve could lick a hundred like that black bastard."
"He was a great fighter," the lumberjack said.
"I hope to God he was," Peroxide said. "I hope to God they don't have fighters like that now. He was like a god, he was. So white and clean and beautiful and smooth and fast and like a tiger or like lightning."
"I saw him in the moving pictures of the fight," Tom said. We were all very moved. Alice was shaking all over and I looked and saw she was crying. The Indians had gone outside on the platform.
"He was more than any husband could ever be," Peroxide said. "We were married in the eyes of God and I belong to him right now and always will and all of me is his. I don't care about my body. They can take my body. My soul belongs to Steve Ketchel. By God, he was a man."
Everybody felt terribly.
It was sad and embarrassing.
Then Alice, who was still shaking, spoke.
"You're a dirty liar," she said in that low voice.
"You never layed Steve Ketchel in your life and you know it.
"How can you say that?" Peroxide said proudly.
"I say it because it's true," Alice said. "I'm the only one here that ever knew Steve Ketchel and I come from Mancelona and I knew him there and it's true and you know it's true and God can strike me dead if it isn't true."
"He can strike me too," Peroxide said.
"This is true, true, true, and you know it. Not just made up and I know exactly what he said to me."
"What did he say?" Peroxide asked, complacently.
Alice was crying so she could hardly speak from shaking so.
"He said 'You're a lovely piece, Alice.' That's exactly what he said."
"It's a lie," Peroxide said.
"It's true," Alice said. "That's truly what he said."
"It's a lie," Peroxide said proudly.
"No, it's true, true, true, to Jesus and Mary true."
"Steve couldn't have said that. It wasn't the way he talked," Peroxide said happily.
"It's true," Alice said in her nice voice. "And it doesn't make any difference to me whether you believe it or not." She wasn't crying any more and she was calm.
"It would be impossible for Steve to have said that," Peroxide declared.
"He said it," Alice said and smiled. "And I remember when he said it and I was a lovely piece then exactly as he said, and right now I'm a better piece than you, you dried up old hot-water bottle."
"You can't insult me," said Peroxide. "You big mountain of pus. I have my memories."
"No," Alice said in that sweet lovely voice, "you haven't got any real memories except having your tubes out and when you started C. and M. Everything else you just read in the papers. I'm clean and you know it and men like me, even though I'm big, and you know it, and I never lie and you know it."
"Leave me with my memories," Peroxide said. "With my true, wonderful memories."
Alice looked at her and then at us and her face lost that hurt look and she smiled and she had about the prettiest face I ever saw.
She had a pretty face and a nice smooth skin and a lovely voice and she was nice all right and really friendly.
But my God she was big.
She was as big as three women.
Tom saw me looking at her and he said, "Come on.
Let's go.
"Good-bye," said Alice. She certainly had a nice voice.
"Good-bye," I said.
"Which way are you boys going?" asked the cook.
"The other way from you," Tom told him.
GOD REST YOU MERRY, GENTLEMEN.
In those days the distances were all very different, the dirt blew off the hills that now have been cut down, and Kansas City was very like Constantinople.
You may not believe this.
No one believes this; but it is true.
On this afternoon it was snowing and inside an automobile dealer's show window, lighted against the early dark, there was a racing motor car finished entirely in silver with Dans Argent lettered on the hood.
This I believed to mean the silver dance or the silver dancer, and, slightly puzzled which it meant but happy in the sight of the car and pleased by my knowledge of a foreign language, I went along the street in the snow.
I was walking from the Woolf Brothers' saloon where, on Christmas and Thanksgiving Day, a free turkey dinner was served, toward the city hospital which was on a high hill that overlooked the smoke, the buildings and the streets of the town.
In the reception room of the hospital were the two ambulance surgeons Doc Fischer and Doctor Wilcox, sitting, the one before a desk, the other in a chair against the wall.
Doc Fischer was thin, sand-blond, with a thin mouth, amused eyes and gambler's hands.
Doctor Wilcox was short, dark and carried an indexed book, The Young Doctor's Friend and Guide, which, being consulted on any given subject, told symptoms and treatment.
It was also cross-indexed so that being consulted on symptoms it gave diagnoses.
Doc Fischer had suggested that any future editions should be further cross-indexed so that if consulted as to the treatments being given, it would reveal ailments and symptoms.
"As an aid to memory," he said.
Doctor Wilcox was sensitive about this book but could not get along without it.
It was bound in limp leather and fitted his coat pocket and he had bought it at the advice of one of his professors who had said, "Wilcox, you have no business being a physician and I have done everything in my power to prevent you from being certified as one.
Since you are now a member of this learned profession I advise you, in the name of humanity, to obtain a copy of The Young Doctor's Friend and Guide and use it, Doctor Wilcox.
Learn to use it.
Doctor Wilcox had said nothing but he had bought the leather-bound guide that same day.
"Well, Horace," Doc Fischer said as I came in the receiving room which smelt of cigarettes, iodoform, carbolic and an over-heated radiator.
"Gentlemen," I said.
"What news along the rialto?" Doc Fischer asked. He affected a certain extravagance of speech which seemed to me to be of the utmost elegance.
"The free turkey at Woolf's," I answered.
"You partook?"
"Copiously."
"Many of the confrères present?"
"All of them. The whole staff."
"Much Yuletide cheer?"
"Not much."
"Doctor Wilcox here has partaken slightly," Doc Fischer said. Doctor Wilcox looked up at him, then at me.
"Want a drink?" he asked.
"No, thanks," I said.
"That's all right," Doctor Wilcox said.
"Horace," Doc Fischer said, "you don't mind me calling you Horace, do you?"
"No."
"Good old Horace. We've had an extremely interesting case."
"I'll say," said Doctor Wilcox.
"You know the lad who was in here yesterday?"
"Which one?"
"The lad who sought eunuch-hood."
"Yes." I had been there when he came in. He was a boy about sixteen. He came in with no hat on and was very excited and frightened but determined. He was curly haired and well built and his lips were prominent.
"What's the matter with you, son?" Doctor Wilcox asked him.
"I want to be castrated," the boy said.
"Why?" Doc Fischer asked.
"I've prayed and I've done everything and nothing helps."
"Helps what?"
"That awful lust."
"What awful lust?"
"The way I get. The way I can't stop getting. I pray all night about it."
"Just what happens?" Doc Fischer asked.
The boy told him.
"Listen, boy," Doc Fischer said.
"There's nothing wrong with you.
That's the way you're supposed to be.
There's nothing wrong with that.
"It is wrong," said the boy. "It's a sin against purity. It's a sin against our Lord and Saviour."
"No," said Doc Fischer. "It's a natural thing. It's the way you are supposed to be and later on you will think you are very fortunate."
"Oh, you don't understand," the boy said.
"Listen," Doc Fischer said and he told the boy certain things.
"No. I won't listen. You can't make me listen."
"Please listen," Doc Fischer said.
"You're just a goddamned fool," Doctor Wilcox said to the boy.
"Then you won't do it?" the boy asked.
"Do what?"
"Castrate me."
"Listen," Doc Fischer said. "No one will castrate you. There is nothing wrong with your body. You have a fine body and you must not think about that. If you are religious remember that what you complain of is no sinful state but the means of consummating a sacrament."
"I can't stop it happening," the boy said. "I pray all night and I pray in the daytime. It is a sin, a constant sin against purity."
"Oh, go and ----" Doctor Wilcox said.
"When you talk like that I don't hear you," the boy said with dignity to Doctor Wilcox. "Won't you please do it?" he asked Doc Fischer.
"No," said Doc Fischer. "I've told you, boy."
"Get him out of here," Doctor Wilcox said.
"I'll get out," the boy said. "Don't touch me. I'll get out."
That was about five o'clock on the day before.
"So what happened?" I asked.
"So at one o'clock this morning," Doc Fischer said, "we received the youth self-mutilated with a razor."
"Castrated?"
"No," said Doc Fischer. "He didn't know what castrate meant."
"He may die," Doctor Wilcox said.
"Why?"
"Loss of blood."
"The good physician here, Doctor Wilcox, my colleague, was on call and he was unable to find this emergency listed in his book."
"The hell with you talking that way," Doctor Wilcox said.
"I only mean it in the friendliest way, Doctor," Doc Fischer said, looking at his hands, at his hands that had, with his willingness to oblige and his lack of respect for Federal statutes, made him his trouble. "Horace here will bear me out that I only speak of it in the very friendliest way. It was an amputation the young man performed, Horace."
"Well, I wish you wouldn't ride me about it," Doctor Wilcox said. "There isn't any need to ride me."
"Ride you, Doctor, on the day, the very anniversary, of our Saviour's birth?"
"Our Saviour? Ain't you a Jew?" Doctor Wilcox said.
"So I am. So I am. It always is slipping my mind. I've never given it its proper importance. So good of you to remind me. Your Saviour. That's right. Your Saviour, undoubtedly your Saviour--and the ride for Palm Sunday."
"You're too damned smart," Doctor Wilcox said.
"An excellent diagnosis, Doctor. I was always too damned smart. Too damned smart on the coast certainly. Avoid it, Horace. You haven't much tendency but sometimes I see a gleam. But what a diagnosis--and without the book."
"The hell with you," Doctor Wilcox said.
"All in good time, Doctor," Doc Fischer said. "All in good time. If there is such a place I shall certainly visit it. I have even had a very small look into it. No more than a peek, really. I looked away almost at once. And do you know what the young man said, Horace, when the good Doctor here brought him in? He said, 'Oh, I asked you to do it. I asked you so many times to do it'."
"On Christmas Day, too," Doctor Wilcox said.
"The significance of the particular day is not important," Doc Fischer said.
"Maybe not to you," said Doctor Wilcox.
"You hear him, Horace?" Doc Fischer said. "You hear him? Having discovered my vulnerable point, my achilles tendon so to speak, the doctor pursues his advantage."
"You're too damned smart," Doctor Wilcox said.
THE SEA CHANGE.
"All right," said the man. "What about it?"
"No," said the girl, "I can't."
"You mean you won't."
"I can't," said the girl. "That's all that I mean."
"You mean that you won't."
"All right," said the girl. "You have it your own way."
"I don't have it my own way. I wish to God I did."
"You did for a long time," the girl said.
It was early, and there was no one in the café except the barman and these two who sat together at a table in the corner.
It was the end of the summer and they were both tanned, so that they looked out of place in Paris.
The girl wore a tweed suit, her skin was a smooth golden brown, her blonde hair was cut short and grew beautifully away from her forehead.
The man looked at her.
"I'll kill her," he said.
"Please don't," the girl said. She had very fine hands and the man looked at them. They were slim and brown and very beautiful.
"I will. I swear to God I will."
"It won't make you happy."
"Couldn't you have gotten into something else? Couldn't you have gotten into some other jam?"
"It seems not," the girl said. "What are you going to do about it?"
"I told you."
"No; I mean really."
"I don't know," he said. She looked at him and put out her hand. "Poor old Phil," she said. He looked at her hands, but he did not touch her hand with his.
"No, thanks," he said.
"It doesn't do any good to say I'm sorry?"
"No."
"Nor to tell you how it is?"
"I'd rather not hear."
"I love you very much."
"Yes, this proves it."
"I'm sorry," she said, "if you don't understand."
"I understand. That's the trouble. I understand."
"You do," she said. "That makes it worse, of course."
"Sure," he said, looking at her. "I'll understand all the time. All day and all night. Especially all night. I'll understand. You don't have to worry about that."
"I'm sorry," she said.
"If it was a man----"
"Don't say that. It wouldn't be a man. You know that. Don't you trust me?"
"That's funny," he said. "Trust you. That's really funny."
"I'm sorry," she said. "That's all I seem to say. But when we do understand each other there's no use to pretend we don't."
"No," he said. "I suppose not."
"I'll come back if you want me."
"No. I don't want you."
Then they did not say anything for a while.
"You don't believe I love you, do you?" the girl asked.
"Let's not talk rot," the man said.
"Don't you really believe I love you?"
"Why don't you prove it?"
"You didn't use to be that way. You never asked me to prove anything. That isn't polite."
"You're a funny girl."
"You're not. You're a fine man and it breaks my heart to go off and leave you----"
"You have to, of course."
"Yes," she said. "I have to and you know it."
He did not say anything and she looked at him and put her hand out again.
The barman was at the far end of the bar.
His face was white and so was his jacket.
He knew these two and thought them a handsome young couple.
He had seen many handsome young couples break up and new couples form that were never so handsome long.
He was not thinking about this, but about a horse.
In half an hour he could send across the street to find if the horse had won.
"Couldn't you just be good to me and let me go?" the girl asked.
"What do you think I'm going to do?"
Two people came in the door and went up to the bar.
"Yes, sir," the barman took the orders.
"You can't forgive me? When you know about it?" the girl asked.
"No."
"You don't think things we've had and done should make any difference in understanding?"
"'Vice is a monster of such fearful mien,'" the young man said bitterly, "that to be something or other needs but to be seen. Then we something, something, then embrace." He could not remember the words. "I can't quote," he said.
"Let's not say vice," she said. "That's not very polite."
"Perversion," he said.
"James," one of the clients addressed the barman, "you're looking very well."
"You're looking very well yourself," the barman said.
"Old James," the other client said. "You're fatter, James."
"It's terrible," the barman said, "the way I put it on."
"Don't neglect to insert the brandy, James," the first client said.
"No, sir," said the barman. "Trust me."
The two at the bar looked over at the two at the table, then looked back at the barman again.
Towards the barman was the comfortable direction.
"I'd like it better if you didn't use words like that," the girl said. "There's no necessity to use a word like that."
"What do you want me to call it?"
"You don't have to call it. You don't have to put any name to it."
"That's the name for it."
"No," she said. "We're made up of all sorts of things. You've known that. You've used it well enough."
"You don't have to say that again."
"Because that explains it to you."
"All right," he said. "All right."
"You mean all wrong. I know. It's all wrong. But I'll come back. I told you I'd come back. I'll come back right away."
"No, you won't."
"I'll come back."
"No, you won't. Not to me."
"You'll see."
"Yes," he said. "That's the hell of it. You probably will."
"Of course I will."
"Go on, then."
"Really?" She could not believe him, but her voice was happy.
"Go on," his voice sounded strange to him. He was looking at her, at the way her mouth went and the curve of her cheek bones, at her eyes and at the way her hair grew on her forehead and at the edge of her ear and at her neck.
"Not really. Oh, you're too sweet," she said. "You're too good to me."
"And when you come back tell me all about it." His voice sounded very strange. He did not recognize it. She looked at him quickly. He was settled into something.
"You want me to go?" she asked seriously.
"Yes," he said seriously. "Right away." His voice was not the same, and his mouth was very dry. "Now," he said.
She stood up and went out quickly.
She did not look back at him.
He watched her go.
He was not the same looking man as he had been before he had told her to go.
He got up from the table, picked up the two checks and went over to the bar with them.
"I'm a different man, James," he said to the barman. "You see in me quite a different man."
"Yes, sir?" said James.
"Vice," said the brown young man, "is a very strange thing, James." He looked out the door. He saw her going down the street. As he looked in the glass, he saw he was really quite a different looking man. The other two at the bar moved down to make room for him.
"You're right there, sir," James said.
The other two moved down a little more, so that he would be quite comfortable.
The young man saw himself in the mirror behind the bar.
"I said I was a different man, James," he said.
Looking into the mirror he saw that this was quite true.
"You look very well, sir," James said. "You must have had a very good summer."
A WAY YOU'LL NEVER BE.
The attack had gone across the field, been held up by machine-gun fire from the sunken road and from the group of farm houses, encountered no resistance in the town, and reached the bank of the river.
Coming along the road on a bicycle, getting off to push the machine when the surface of the road became too broken, Nicholas Adams saw what had happened by the position of the dead.
They lay alone or in clumps in the high grass of the field and along the road, their pockets out, and over them were flies and around each body or group of bodies were the scattered papers.
In the grass and the grain, beside the road, and in some places scattered over the road, there was much material: a field kitchen, it must have come over when things were going well; many of the calf-skin-covered haversacks, stick bombs, helmets, rifles, sometimes one butt up, the bayonet stuck in the dirt, they had dug quite a little at the last; stick bombs, helmets, rifles, intrenching tools, ammunition boxes, star-shell pistols, their shells scattered about, medical kits, gas masks, empty gas-mask cans, a squat, tripodded machine gun in a nest of empty shells, full belts protruding from the boxes, the water-cooling can empty and on its side, the breech block gone, the crew in odd positions, and around them, in the grass, more of the typical papers.
There were mass prayer books, group postcards showing the machine-gun unit standing in ranked and ruddy cheerfulness as in a football picture for a college annual; now they were humped and swollen in the grass; propaganda postcards showing a soldier in Austrian uniform bending a woman backward over a bed; the figures were impressionistically drawn; very attractively depicted and had nothing in common with actual rape in which the woman's skirts are pulled over her head to smother her, one comrade sometimes sitting upon the head.
There were many of these inciting cards which had evidently been issued just before the offensive.
Now they were scattered with the smutty postcards, photographic; the small photographs of village girls by village photographers, the occasional pictures of children, and the letters, letters, letters.
There was always much paper about the dead and the débris of this attack was no exception.
These were new dead and no one had bothered with anything but their pockets.
Our own dead, or what he thought of, still, as our own dead, were surprisingly few, Nick noticed.
Their coats had been opened too and their pockets were out, and they showed, by their positions, the manner and the skill of the attack.
The hot weather had swollen them all alike regardless of nationality.
The town had evidently been defended, at the last, from the line of the sunken road and there had been few or no Austrians to fall back into it.
There were only three bodies in the street and they looked to have been killed running.
The houses of the town were broken by the shelling and the street had much rubble of plaster and mortar and there were broken beams, broken tiles, and many holes, some of them yellow-edged from the mustard gas.
There were many pieces of shell, and shrapnel balls were scattered in the rubble.
There was no one in the town at all.
Nick Adams had seen no one since he had left Fornaci, although, riding along the road through the over-foliaged country, he had seen guns hidden under screens of mulberry leaves to the left of the road, noticing them by the heatwaves in the air above the leaves where the sun hit the metal.
Now he went on through the town, surprised to find it deserted, and came out on the low road beneath the bank of the river.
Leaving the town there was a bare open space where the road slanted down and he could see the placid reach of the river and the low curve of the opposite bank and the whitened, sun-baked mud where the Austrians had dug.
It was all very lush and over-green since he had seen it last and becoming historical had made no change in this, the lower river.
The battalion was along the bank to the left.
There was a series of holes in the top of the bank with a few men in them.
Nick noticed where the machine guns were posted and the signal rockets in their racks.
The men in the holes in the side of the bank were sleeping.
No one challenged.
He went on and as he came around a turn in the mud bank a young second lieutenant with a stubble of beard and red-rimmed, very blood-shot eyes pointed a pistol at him.
"Who are you?"
Nick told him.
"How do I know this?"
Nick showed him the tessera with photograph and identification and the seal of the third army.
He took hold of it.
"I will keep this."
"You will not," Nick said. "Give me back the card and put your gun away. There. In the holster."
"How am I to know who you are?"
"The tessera tells you."
"And if the tessera is false? Give me that card."
"Don't be a fool," Nick said cheerfully. "Take me to your company commander."
"I should send you to battalion headquarters."
"All right," said Nick. "Listen, do you know the Captain Paravicini? The tall one with the small mustache who was an architect and speaks English?"
"You know him?"
"A little."
"What company does he command?"
"The second."
"He is commanding the battalion."
"Good," said Nick. He was relieved to know that Para was all right. "Let us go to the battalion."
As Nick had left the edge of the town three shrapnel had burst high and to the right over one of the wrecked houses and since then there had been no shelling.
But the face of this officer looked like the face of a man during a bombardment.
There was the same tightness and the voice did not sound natural.
His pistol made Nick nervous.
"Put it away," he said. "There's the whole river between them and you."
"If I thought you were a spy I would shoot you now," the second lieutenant said.
"Come on," said Nick. "Let us go to the battalion." This officer made him very nervous.
The Captain Paravicini, acting major, thinner and more English looking than ever, rose when Nick saluted from behind the table in the dugout that was battalion headquarters.
"Hello," he said. "I didn't know you. What are you doing in that uniform?"
"They've put me in it."
"I am very glad to see you, Nicolo."
"Right. You look well. How was the show?"
"We made a very fine attack. Truly. A very fine attack. I will show you. Look."
He showed on the map how the attack had gone.
"I came from Fornaci," Nick said. "I could see how it had been. It was very good."
"It was extraordinary. Altogether extraordinary. Are you attached to the regiment?"
"No. I am supposed to move around and let them see the uniform."
"How odd."
"If they see one American uniform that is supposed to make them believe others are coming."
"But how will they know it is an American uniform?"
"You will tell them."
"Oh. Yes, I see. I will send a corporal with you to show you about and you will make a tour of the lines."
"Like a bloody politician," Nick said.
"You would be much more distinguished in civilian clothes. They are what is really distinguished."
"With a homburg hat," said Nick.
"Or with a very furry fedora."
"I'm supposed to have my pockets full of cigarettes and postal cards and such things," Nick said. "I should have a musette full of chocolate. These I should distribute with a kind word and a pat on the back. But there weren't any cigarettes and postcards and no chocolate. So they said to circulate around anyway."
"I'm sure your appearance will be very heartening to the troops."
"I wish you wouldn't," Nick said. "I feel badly enough about it as it is. In principle, I would have brought you a bottle of brandy."
"In principle," Para said and smiled, for the first time, showing yellowed teeth. "Such a beautiful expression. Would you like some Grappa?"
"No, thank you," Nick said.
"It hasn't any ether in it."
"I can taste that still," Nick remembered suddenly and completely.
"You know I never knew you were drunk until you started talking coming back in the camions."
"I was stinking in every attack," Nick said.
"I can't do it," Para said. "I took it in the first show, the very first show, and it only made me very upset and then frightfully thirsty."
"You don't need it."
"You're much braver in an attack than I am."
"No," Nick said. "I know how I am and I prefer to get stinking. I'm not ashamed of it."
"I've never seen you drunk."
"No?" said Nick. "Never? Not when we rode from Mestre to Portogrande that night and I wanted to go to sleep and used the bicycle for a blanket and pulled it up under my chin?"
"That wasn't in the lines."
"Let's not talk about how I am," Nick said. "It's a subject I know too much about to want to think about it any more."
"You might as well stay here a while," Paravicini said. "You can take a nap if you like. They didn't do much to this in the bombardment. It's too hot to go out yet."
"I suppose there is no hurry."
"How are you really?"
"I'm fine. I'm perfectly all right."
"No. I mean really."
"I'm all right. I can't sleep without a light of some sort. That's all I have now."
"I said it should have been trepanned. I'm no doctor but I know that."
"Well, they thought it was better to have it absorb, and that's what I got. What's the matter? I don't seem crazy to you, do I?"
"You seem in top-hole shape."
"It's a hell of a nuisance once they've had you certified as nutty," Nick said. "No one ever has any confidence in you again."
"I would take a nap, Nicolo," Paravicini said. "This isn't battalion headquarters as we used to know it. We're just waiting to be pulled out. You oughtn't to go out in the heat now--it's silly. Use that bunk."
"I might just lie down," Nick said.
Nick lay on the bunk.
He was very disappointed that he felt this way and more disappointed, even, that it was so obvious to Captain Paravicini.
This was not as large a dugout as the one where that platoon of the class of 1899, just out at the front, got hysterics during the bombardment before the attack, and Para had had him walk them two at a time outside to show them nothing would happen, he wearing his own chin strap tight across his mouth to keep his lips quiet.
Knowing they could not hold it when they took it.
Knowing it was all a bloody balls--If he can't stop crying, break his nose to give him something else to think about.
I'd shoot one but it's too late now.
They'd all be worse.
Break his nose.
They've put it back to five-twenty.
We've only got four minutes more.
Break that other silly bugger's nose and kick his silly ass out of here.
Do you think they'll go over? If they don't, shoot two and try to scoop the others out some way.
Keep behind them, sergeant.
It's no use to walk ahead and find there's nothing coming behind you.
Bail them out as you go.
What a bloody balls.
All right.
That's right.
Then, looking at the watch, in that quiet tone, that valuable quiet tone, "Savoia.
" Making it cold, no time to get it, he couldn't find his own after the cave-in, one whole end had caved in; it was that started them; making it cold up that slope the only time he hadn't done it stinking.
And after they came back the teleferica house burned, it seemed, and some of the wounded got down four days later and some did not get down, but we went up and we went back and we came down--we always came down.
And there was Gaby Delys, oddly enough, with feathers on; you called me baby doll a year ago tadada you said that I was rather nice to know tadada with feathers on, with feathers off, the great Gaby, and my name's Harry Pilcer, too, we used to step out of the far side of the taxis when it got steep going up the hill and he could see that hill every night when he dreamed with Sacré Coeur, blown white, like a soap bubble.
Sometimes his girl was there and sometimes she was with some one else and he could not understand that, but those were the nights the river ran so much wider and stiller than it should and outside of Fossalta there was a low house painted yellow with willows all around it and a low stable and there was a canal, and he had been there a thousand times and never seen it, but there it was every night as plain as the hill, only it frightened him.
That house meant more than anything and every night he had it.
That was what he needed but it frightened him especially when the boat lay there quietly in the willows on the canal, but the banks weren't like this river.
It was all lower, as it was at Portogrande, where they had seen them come wallowing across the flooded ground holding the rifles high until they fell with them in the water.
Who ordered that one? If it didn't get so damned mixed up he could follow it all right.
That was why he noticed everything in such detail to keep it all straight so he would know just where he was, but suddenly it confused without reason as now, he lying in a bunk at battalion headquarters, with Para commanding a battalion and he in a bloody American uniform.
He sat up and looked around; they all watching him.
Para was gone out.
He lay down again.
The Paris part came earlier and he was not frightened of it except when she had gone off with some one else and the fear that they might take the same driver twice.
That was what frightened about that.
Never about the front.
He never dreamed about the front now any more but what frightened him so that he could not get rid of it was that long yellow house and the different width of the river.
Now he was back here at the river, he had gone through that same town, and there was no house.
Nor was the river that way.
Then where did he go each night and what was the peril, and why would he wake, soaking wet, more frightened than he had ever been in a bombardment, because of a house and a long stable and a canal?.
He sat up, swung his legs carefully down; they stiffened any time they were out straight for long; returned the stares of the adjutant, the signallers and the two runners by the door and put on his cloth-covered trench helmet.
"I regret the absence of the chocolate, the postal-cards and cigarettes," he said. "I am, however, wearing the uniform."
"The major is coming back at once," the adjutant said. In that army an adjutant is not a commissioned officer.
"The uniform is not very correct," Nick told them. "But it gives you the idea. There will be several millions of Americans here shortly."
"Do you think they will send Americans down here?" asked the adjutant.
"Oh, absolutely. Americans twice as large as myself, healthy, with clean hearts, sleep at night, never been wounded, never been blown up, never had their heads caved in, never been scared, don't drink, faithful to the girls they left behind them, many of them never had crabs, wonderful chaps. You'll see."
"Are you an Italian?" asked the adjutant.
"No, American. Look at the uniform. Spagnolini made it but it's not quite correct."
"A North or South American?"
"North," said Nick. He felt it coming on now. He would quiet down.
"But you speak Italian."
"Why not? Do you mind if I speak Italian? Haven't I a right to speak Italian?"
"You have Italian medals."
"Just the ribbons and the papers. The medals come later. Or you give them to people to keep and the people go away; or they are lost with your baggage. You can purchase others in Milan. It is the papers that are of importance. You must not feel badly about them. You will have some yourself if you stay at the front long enough."
"I am a veteran of the Iritrea campaign," said the adjutant stiffly. "I fought in Tripoli."
"It's quite something to have met you," Nick put out his hand. "Those must have been trying days. I noticed the ribbons. Were you, by any chance, on the Carso?"
"I have just been called up for this war. My class was too old."
"At one time I was under the age limit," Nick said. "But now I am reformed out of the war."
"But why are you here now?"
"I am demonstrating the American uniform," Nick said. "Don't you think it is very significant? It is a little tight in the collar but soon you will see untold millions wearing this uniform swarming like locusts. The grasshopper, you know, what we call the grasshopper in America, is really a locust. The true grasshopper is small and green and comparatively feeble. You must not, however, make a confusion with the seven-year locust or cicada which emits a peculiar sustained sound which at the moment I cannot recall. I try to recall it but I cannot. I can almost hear it and then it is quite gone. You will pardon me if I break off our conversation?"
"See if you can find the major," the adjutant said to one of the two runners. "I can see you have been wounded," he said to Nick.
"In various places," Nick said. "If you are interested in scars I can show you some very interesting ones but I would rather talk about grasshoppers. What we call grasshoppers that is; and what are, really, locusts. These insects at one time played a very important part in my life. It might interest you and you can look at the uniform while I am talking."
The adjutant made a motion with his hand to the second runner who went out.
"Fix your eyes on the uniform. Spagnolini made it, you know. You might as well look, too," Nick said to the signallers. "I really have no rank. We're under the American consul. It's perfectly all right for you to look. You can stare, if you like. I will tell you about the American locust. We always preferred one that we called the medium-brown. They last the best in the water and fish prefer them. The larger ones that fly making a noise somewhat similar to that produced by a rattlesnake rattling his rattlers, a very dry sound, have vivid colored wings, some are bright red, others yellow barred with black, but their wings go to pieces in the water and they make a very blowsy bait, while the medium-brown is a plump, compact, succulent hopper that I can recommend as far as one may well recommend something you gentlemen will probably never encounter. But I must insist that you will never gather a sufficient supply of these insects for a day's fishing by pursuing them with your hands or trying to hit them with a hat. That is sheer nonsense and a useless waste of time. I repeat, gentlemen, that you will get nowhere at it. The correct procedure, and one which should be taught all young officers at every small-arms course if I had anything to say about it, and who knows but what I will have, is the employment of a seine or net made of common mosquito netting. Two officers holding this length of netting at alternate ends, or let us say one at each end, stoop, hold the bottom extremity of the net in one hand and the top extremity in the other and run into the wind. The hoppers, flying with the wind, fly against the length of netting and are imprisoned in its folds. It is no trick at all to catch a very great quantity indeed, and no officer, in my opinion, should be without a length of mosquito netting suitable for the improvisation of one of these grasshopper seines. I hope I have made myself clear, gentlemen. Are there any questions? If there is anything in the course you do not understand please ask questions. Speak up. None? Then I would like to close on this note. In the words of that great soldier and gentleman, Sir Henry Wilson: Gentlemen, either you must govern or you must be governed. Let me repeat it. Gentlemen, there is one thing I would like to have you remember. One thing I would like you to take with you as you leave this room. Gentlemen, either you must govern--or you must be governed. That is all, gentlemen. Good-day."
He removed his cloth-covered helmet, put it on again and, stooping, went out the low entrance of the dugout.
Para, accompanied by the two runners, was coming down the line of the sunken road.
It was very hot in the sun and Nick removed the helmet.
"There ought to be a system for wetting these things," he said. "I shall wet this one in the river." He started up the bank.
"Nicolo," Paravicini called. "Nicolo. Where are you going?"
"I don't really have to go." Nick came down the slope, holding the helmet in his hands. "They're a damned nuisance wet or dry. Do you wear yours all the time?"
"All the time," said Para. "It's making me bald. Come inside."
Inside Para told him to sit down.
"You know they're absolutely no damned good," Nick said. "I remember when they were a comfort when we first had them, but I've seen them full of brains too many times."
"Nicolo," Para said. "I think you should go back. I think it would be better if you didn't come up to the line until you had those supplies. There's nothing here for you to do. If you move around, even with something worth giving away, the men will group and that invites shelling. I won't have it."
"I know it's silly," Nick said. "It wasn't my idea. I heard the brigade was here so I thought I would see you or some one else I knew. I could have gone to Zenzon or to San Dona. I'd like to go to San Dona to see the bridge again."
"I won't have you circulating around to no purpose," Captain Paravicini said.
"All right," said Nick. He felt it coming on again.
"You understand?"
"Of course," said Nick. He was trying to hold it in.
"Anything of that sort should be done at night."
"Naturally," said Nick. He knew he could not stop it now.
"You see, I am commanding the battalion," Para said.
"And why shouldn't you be?" Nick said. Here it came. "You can read and write, can't you?"
"Yes," said Para gently.
"The trouble is you have a damned small battalion to command. As soon as it gets to strength again they'll give you back your company. Why don't they bury the dead? I've seen them now. I don't care about seeing them again. They can bury them any time as far as I'm concerned and it would be much better for you. You'll all get bloody sick."
"Where did you leave your bicycle?"
"Inside the last house."
"Do you think it will be all right?"
"Don't worry," Nick said. "I'll go in a little while."
"Lie down a little while, Nicolo."
"All right."
He shut his eyes, and in place of the man with the beard who looked at him over the sights of the rifle, quite calmly before squeezing off, the white flash and clublike impact, on his knees, hot-sweet choking, coughing it onto the rock while they went past him, he saw a long, yellow house with a low stable and the river much wider than it was and stiller.
"Christ," he said, "I might as well go.
He stood up.
"I'm going, Para," he said. "I'll ride back now in the afternoon. If any supplies have come I'll bring them down tonight. If not I'll come at night when I have something to bring."
"It is still hot to ride," Captain Paravicini said.
"You don't need to worry," Nick said. "I'm all right now for quite a while. I had one then but it was easy. They're getting much better. I can tell when I'm going to have one because I talk so much."
"I'll send a runner with you."
"I'd rather you didn't. I know the way."
"You'll be back soon?"
"Absolutely."
"Let me send----"
"No," said Nick. "As a mark of confidence."
"Well, Ciaou then."
"Ciaou," said Nick. He started back along the sunken road toward where he had left the bicycle. In the afternoon the road would be shady once he had passed the canal. Beyond that there were trees on both sides that had not been shelled at all. It was on that stretch that, marching, they had once passed the Terza Savoia cavalry regiment riding in the snow with their lances. The horses' breath made plumes in the cold air. No, that was somewhere else. Where was that?
"I'd better get to that damned bicycle," Nick said to himself. "I don't want to lose the way to Fornaci."
THE MOTHER OF A QUEEN.
When his father died he was only a kid and his manager buried him perpetually.
That is, so he would have the plot permanently.
But when his mother died his manager thought they might not always be so hot on each other.
They were sweethearts; sure he's a queen, didn't you know that, of course he is.
So he just buried her for five years.
Well, when he came back to Mexico from Spain he got the first notice.
It said it was the first notice that the five years were up and would he make arrangements for the continuing of his mother's grave.
It was only twenty dollars for perpetual.
I had the cash box then and I said let me attend to it, Paco.
But he said no, he would look after it.
He'd look after it right away.
It was his mother and he wanted to do it himself.
Then in a week he got the second notice.
I read it to him and I said I thought he had looked after it.
No, he said, he hadn't.
"Let me do it," I said. "It's right here in the cash box."
No, he said.
Nobody could tell him what to do.
He'd do it himself when he got around to it.
"What's the sense in spending money sooner than necessary?".
"All right," I said, "but see you look after it." At this time he had a contract for six fights at four thousand pesos a fight besides his benefit fight. He made over fifteen thousand dollars there in the capital alone. He was just tight, that's all.
The third notice came in another week and I read it to him.
It said that if he did not make the payment by the following Saturday his mother's grave would be opened and her remains dumped on the common boneheap.
He said he would go attend to it that afternoon when he went to town.
"Why not have me do it?" I asked him.
"Keep out of my business," he said. "It's my business and I'm going to do it."
"All right, if that's the way you feel about it," I said. "Do your own business."
He got the money out of the cash box, although then he always carried a hundred or more pesos with him all the time, and he said he would look after it.
He went out with the money and so of course I thought he had attended to it.
A week later the notice came that they had no response to the final warning and so his mother's body had been dumped on the boneheap; on the public boneheap.
"Jesus Christ," I said to him, "you said you'd pay that and you took money out of the cash box to do it and now what's happened to your mother? My God, think of it! The public boneheap and your own mother. Why didn't you let me look after it? I would have sent it when the first notice came."
"It's none of your business. It's my mother."
"It's none of my business, yes, but it was your business. What kind of blood is it in a man that will let that be done to his mother? You don't deserve to have a mother."
"It is my mother," he said. "Now she is so much dearer to me. Now I don't have to think of her buried in one place and be sad. Now she is all about me in the air, like the birds and the flowers. Now she will always be with me."
"Jesus Christ," I said, "what kind of blood have you anyway? I don't want you to even speak to me."
"She is all around me," he said. "Now I will never be sad."
At that time he was spending all kinds of money around women trying to make himself seem a man and fool people, but it didn't have any effect on people that knew anything about him.
He owed me over six hundred pesos and he wouldn't pay me.
"Why do you want it now?" he'd say.
"Don't you trust me? Aren't we friends?".
"It isn't friends or trusting you. It's that I paid the accounts out of my own money while you were away and now I need the money back and you have it to pay me."
"I haven't got it."
"You have it," I said. "It's in the cash box now and you can pay me."
"I need that money for something," he said. "You don't know all the needs I have for money."
"I stayed here all the time you were in Spain and you authorized me to pay these things as they came up, all these things of the house, and you didn't send any money while you were gone and I paid over six hundred pesos in my own money and now I need it and you can pay me."
"I'll pay you soon," he said. "Right now I need the money badly."
"For what?"
"For my own business."
"Why don't you pay me some on account?"
"I can't," he said. "I need that money too badly. But I will pay you."
He had only fought twice in Spain, they couldn't stand him there, they saw through him quick enough, and he had seven new fighting suits made and this is the kind of thing he was: he had them packed so badly that four of them were ruined by sea water on the trip back and he couldn't even wear them.
"My God," I said to him, "you go to Spain. You stay there the whole season and only fight two times. You spend all the money you took with you on suits and then have them spoiled by salt water so you can't wear them. That is the kind of season you have and then you talk to me about running your own business. Why don't you pay me the money you owe me so I can leave?"
"I want you here," he said, "and I will pay you. But now I need the money."
"You need it too badly to pay for your own mother's grave to keep your mother buried. Don't you?" I said.
"I am happy about what has happened to my mother," he said. "You cannot understand."
"Thank Christ I can't," I said. "You pay me what you owe me or I will take it out of the cash box."
"I will keep the cash box myself," he said.
"No, you won't," I said.
That very afternoon he came to me with a punk, some fellow from his own town who was broke, and said, "Here is a paesano who needs money to go home because his mother is very sick.
" This fellow was just a punk, you understand, a nobody he'd never seen before, but from his home town, and he wanted to be the big, generous matador with a fellow townsman.
"Give him fifty pesos from the cash box," he told me.
"You just told me you had no money to pay me," I said. "And now you want to give fifty pesos to this punk."
"He is a fellow townsman," he said, "and he is in distress."
"You bitch," I said. I gave him the key of the cash box. "Get it yourself. I'm going to town."
"Don't be angry," he said. "I'm going to pay you."
I got the car out to go to town.
It was his car but he knew I drove it better than he did.
Everything he did I could do better.
He knew it.
He couldn't even read and write.
I was going to see somebody and see what I could do about making him pay me.
He came out and said, "I'm coming with you and I'm going to pay you.
We are good friends.
There is no need to quarrel.
We drove into the city and I was driving.
Just before we came into the town he pulled out twenty pesos.
"Here's the money," he said.
"You motherless bitch," I said to him and told him what he could do with the money. "You give fifty pesos to that punk and then offer me twenty when you owe me six hundred. I wouldn't take a nickel from you. You know what you can do with it."
I got out of the car without a peso in my pocket and I didn't know where I was going to sleep that night.
Later I went out with a friend and got my things from his place.
I never spoke to him again until this year.
I met him walking with three friends in the evening on the way to the Callao cinema in the Gran Via in Madrid.
He put his hand out to me.
"Hello Roger, old friend," he said to me. "How are you? People say you are talking against me. That you say all sorts of unjust things about me."
"All I say is you never had a mother," I said to him. That's the worst thing you can say to insult a man in Spanish.
"That's true," he said. "My poor mother died when I was so young it seems as though I never had a mother. It's very sad."
There's a queen for you.
You can't touch them.
Nothing, nothing can touch them.
They spend money on themselves or for vanity, but they never pay.
Try to get one to pay.
I told him what I thought of him right there on the Gran Via, in front of three friends, but he speaks to me now when I meet him as though we were friends.
What kind of blood is it that makes a man like that?.
ONE READER WRITES.
She sat at the table in her bedroom with a newspaper folded open before her and only stopping to look out of the window at the snow which was falling and melting on the roof as it fell.
She wrote this letter, writing it steadily with no necessity to cross out or rewrite anything.
Roanoke, Virginia.
February 6, 1933.
Dear Doctor--.
May I write you for some very important advice--I have a decision to make and don't know just whom to trust most I dare not ask my parents--and so I come to you--and only because I need not see you, can I confide in you even.
Now here is the situation--I married a man in U.
service in 1929 and that same year he was sent to China, Shanghai--he staid three years--and came home--he was discharged from the service some few months ago--and went to his mother's home in Helena, Arkansas.
He wrote for me to come home--I went, and found he is taking a course of injections and I naturally ask, and found he is being treated for I don't know how to spell the word but it sound like this "sifilus"--Do you know what I mean--now tell me will it ever be safe for me to live with him again--I did not come in close contact with him at any time since his return from China.
He assures me he will be O K after this doctor finishes with him--Do you think it right--I often heard my Father say one could well wish themselves dead if once they become a victim of that malady--I believe my Father but want to believe my Husband most--Please, please tell me what to do--I have a daughter born while her Father was in China--.
Thanking you and trusting wholly in your advice I am.
and signed her name.
Maybe he can tell me what's right to do, she said to herself.
Maybe he can tell me.
In the picture in the paper he looks like he'd know.
He looks smart, all right.
Every day he tells somebody what to do.
He ought to know.
I want to do whatever is right.
It's such a long time though.
It's a long time.
And it's been a long time.
My Christ, it's been a long time.
He had to go wherever they sent him, I know, but I don't know what he had to get it for.
Oh, I wish to Christ he wouldn't have got it.
I don't care what he did to get it.
But I wish to Christ he hadn't ever got it.
It does seem like he didn't have to have got it.
I don't know what to do.
I wish to Christ he hadn't got any kind of malady.
I don't know why he had to get a malady.
HOMAGE TO SWITZERLAND.
PART I.
PORTRAIT OF MR.
WHEELER IN MONTREUX.
Inside the station café it was warm and light.
The wood of the tables shone from wiping and there were baskets of pretzels in glazed paper sacks.
The chairs were carved, but the seats were worn and comfortable.
There was a carved wooden clock on the wall and a bar at the far end of the room.
Outside the window it was snowing.
Two of the station porters sat drinking new wine at the table under the clock.
Another porter came in and said the Simplon-Orient Express was an hour late at Saint Maurice.
He went out.
The waitress came over to Mr.
Wheeler's table.
"The Express is an hour late, sir," she said. "Can I bring you some coffee?"
"If you think it won't keep me awake."
"Please?" asked the waitress.
"Bring me some," said Mr. Wheeler.
"Thank you."
She brought the coffee from the kitchen and Mr.
Wheeler looked out the window at the snow falling in the light from the station platform.
"Do you speak other languages besides English?" he asked the waitress.
"Oh, yes, sir. I speak German and French and the dialects."
"Would you like a drink of something?"
"Oh, no, sir. It is not permitted to drink in the café with the clients."
"You won't take a cigar?"
"Oh, no, sir. I don't smoke, sir."
"That is all right," said Mr. Wheeler. He looked out of the window again, drank the coffee, and lit a cigarette.
"Fräulein," he called. The waitress came over.
"What would you like, sir?"
"You," he said.
"You must not joke me like that."
"I'm not joking."
"Then you must not say it."
"I haven't time to argue," Mr. Wheeler said. "The train comes in forty minutes. If you'll go upstairs with me I'll give you a hundred francs."
"You should not say such things, sir. I will ask the porter to speak with you."
"I don't want a porter," Mr. Wheeler said. "Nor a policeman nor one of those boys that sell cigarettes. I want you."
"If you talk like that you must go out. You cannot stay here and talk like that."
"Why don't you go away, then? If you go away I can't talk to you."
The waitress went away.
Wheeler watched to see if she spoke to the porters.
She did not.
"Mademoiselle!" he called. The waitress came over. "Bring me a bottle of Sion, please."
"Yes, sir."
Wheeler watched her go out, then come in with the wine and bring it to his table.
He looked toward the clock.
"I'll give you two hundred francs," he said.
"Please do not say such things."
"Two hundred francs is a great deal of money."
"You will not say such things!" the waitress said. She was losing her English. Mr. Wheeler looked at her interestedly.
"Two hundred francs."
"You are hateful."
"Why don't you go away, then? I can't talk to you if you're not here."
The waitress left the table and went over to the bar.
Wheeler drank the wine and smiled to himself for some time.
"Mademoiselle," he called. The waitress pretended not to hear him. "Mademoiselle," he called again. The waitress came over.
"You wish something?"
"Very much. I'll give you three hundred francs."
"You are hateful."
"Three hundred francs Swiss."
She went away and Mr.
Wheeler looked after her.
A porter opened the door.
He was the one who had Mr.
Wheeler's bags in his charge.
"The train is coming, sir," he said in French. Mr. Wheeler stood up.
"Mademoiselle," he called. The waitress came toward the table. "How much is the wine?"
"Seven francs."
Wheeler counted out eight francs and left them on the table.
He put on his coat and followed the porter onto the platform where the snow was falling.
"Au revoir, mademoiselle," he said. The waitress watched him go. He's ugly, she thought, ugly and hateful. Three hundred francs for a thing that is nothing to do. How many times have I done that for nothing. And no place to go here. If he had sense he would know there was no place. No time and no place to go. Three hundred francs to do that. What people those Americans.
Standing on the cement platform beside his bags, looking down the rails toward the headlight of the train coming through the snow, Mr.
Wheeler was thinking that it was very inexpensive sport.
He had only spent, actually, aside from the dinner, seven francs for a bottle of wine and a franc for the tip.
Seventy-five centimes would have been better.
He would have felt better now if the tip had been seventy-five centimes.
One franc Swiss is five francs French.
Wheeler was headed for Paris.
He was very careful about money and did not care for women.
He had been in that station before and he knew there was no upstairs to go to.
Wheeler never took chances.
PART II.
JOHNSON TALKS ABOUT IT AT VEVEY.
Inside the station café it was warm and light; the tables were shiny from wiping and on some there were red and white striped table cloths; and there were blue and white striped table cloths on the others and on all of them baskets with pretzels in glazed paper sacks.
The chairs were carved but the wood seats were worn and comfortable.
There was a clock on the wall, a zinc bar at the far end of the room, and outside the window it was snowing.
Two of the station porters sat drinking new wine at the table under the clock.
Another porter came in and said the Simplon-Orient Express was an hour late at Saint Maurice.
The waitress came over to Mr.
Johnson's table.
"The Express is an hour late, sir," she said. "Can I bring you some coffee?"
"If it's not too much trouble."
"Please?" asked the waitress.
"I'll take some."
"Thank you."
She brought the coffee from the kitchen and Mr.
Johnson looked out the window at the snow falling in the light from the station platform.
"Do you speak other languages besides English?" he asked the waitress.
"Oh, yes, I speak German and French and the dialects."
"Would you like a drink of something?"
"Oh, no, sir, it is not permitted to drink in the café with the clients."
"Have a cigar?"
"Oh, no, sir," she laughed. "I don't smoke, sir."
"Neither do I," said Johnson. "It's a dirty habit."
The waitress went away and Johnson lit a cigarette and drank the coffee.
The clock on the wall marked a quarter to ten.
His watch was a little fast.
The train was due at ten-thirty--an hour late meant eleven-thirty.
Johnson called to the waitress.
"Signorina!"
"What would you like, sir?"
"You wouldn't like to play with me?" Johnson asked. The waitress blushed.
"No, sir."
"I don't mean anything violent. You wouldn't like to make up a party and see the night life of Vevey? Bring a girl friend if you like."
"I must work" the waitress said. "I have my duty here."
"I know," said Johnson. "But couldn't you get a substitute? They used to do that in the Civil War."
"Oh, no, sir. I must be here myself in the person."
"Where did you learn your English?"
"At the Berlitz school, sir."
"Tell me about it," Johnson said. "Were the Berlitz undergraduates a wild lot? What about all this necking and petting? Were there many smoothies? Did you ever run into Scott Fitzgerald?"
"Please?"
"I mean were your college days the happiest days of your life? What sort of team did Berlitz have last fall?"
"You are joking, sir?"
"Only feebly," said Johnson. "You're an awfully good girl. And you don't want to play with me?"
"Oh, no, sir," said the waitress. "Would you like me to bring you something?"
"Yes," said Johnson. "Would you bring me the wine list?"
"Yes, sir."
Johnson walked over with the wine list to the table where the three porters sat.
They looked up at him.
They were old men.
"Wollen Sie trinken?" he asked. One of them nodded and smiled.
"Oui, monsieur."
"You speak French?"
"Oui, monsieur."
"What shall we drink? Connais vous des champagnes?"
"Non, monsieur."
"Faut les connaître," said Johnson. "Fräulein," he called the waitress. "We will drink champagne."
"Which champagne would you prefer, sir?"
"The best," said Johnson. "Laquelle est le best?" he asked the porters.
"Le meillieur?" asked the porter who had spoken first.
"By all means."
The porter took out a pair of gold-rimmed glasses from his coat pocket and looked over the list.
He ran his finger down the four typewritten names and prices.
"Sportsman," he said. "Sportsman is the best."
"You agree, gentlemen?" Johnson asked the other porters. The one porter nodded. The other said in French, "I don't know them personally but I've often heard speak of Sportsman. It's good."
"A bottle of Sportsman," Johnson said to the waitress. He looked at the price on the wine card: eleven francs Swiss. "Make it two Sportsmen. Do you mind if I sit here with you?" he asked the porter who had suggested Sportsman.
"Sit down. Put yourself here, please." The porter smiled at him. He was folding his spectacles and putting them away in their case. "Is it the gentleman's birthday?"
"No," said Johnson. "It's not a fête. My wife has decided to divorce me."
"So," said the porter. "I hope not." The other porter shook his head. The third porter seemed a little deaf.
"It is doubtless a common experience," said Johnson, "like the first visit to the dentist or the first time a girl is unwell, but I have been upset."
"It is understandable," said the oldest porter. "I understand it."
"None of you gentlemen is divorced?" Johnson asked. He had stopped clowning with the language and was speaking good French now and had been for some time.
"No," said the porter who had ordered Sportsman. "They don't divorce much here. There are gentlemen who are divorced but not many."
"With us," said Johnson, "it's different. Practically every one is divorced."
"That's true," the porter confirmed. "I've read it in the paper."
"I myself am somewhat in retard," Johnson went on. "This is the first time I have been divorced. I am thirty-five."
"Mais vous êtes encore jeune," said the porter. He explained to the two others. "Monsieur n'a que trente-cinq ans." The other porters nodded. "He's very young," said one.
"And it is really the first time you've been divorced?" asked the porter.
"Absolutely," said Johnson. "Please open the wine, mademoiselle."
"And is it very expensive?"
"Ten thousand francs."
"Swiss money?"
"No, French money."
"Oh, yes. Two thousand francs Swiss. All the same it's not cheap."
"No."
"And why does one do it?"
"One is asked to."
"But why do they ask that?"
"To marry some one else."
"But it's idiotic."
"I agree with you," said Johnson. The waitress filled the four glasses. They all raised them.
"Prosit," said Johnson.
"A votre santé, monsieur," said the porter. The other two porters said "Salut." The champagne tasted like sweet pink cider.
"Is it a system always to respond in a different language in Switzerland?" Johnson asked.
"No," said the porter. "French is more cultivated. Besides, this is la Suisse Romande."
"But you speak German?"
"Yes. Where I come from they speak German."
"I see," said Johnson, "and you say you have never been divorced?"
"No. It would be too expensive. Besides I have never married."
"Ah," said Johnson. "And these other gentlemen?"
"They are married."
"You like being married?" Johnson asked one of the porters.
"What?"
"You like the married state?"
"Oui. C'est normale."
"Exactly," said Johnson. "Et vous, monsieur?"
"Ça va," said the other porter.
"Pour moi," said Johnson, "ça ne va pas."
"Monsieur is going to divorce," the first porter explained.
"Oh," said the second porter.
"Ah ha," the third porter said.
"Well," said Johnson, "the subject seems to be exhausted. You're not interested in my troubles," he addressed the first porter.
"But, yes," said the porter.
"Well, let's talk about something else."
"As you wish."
"What can we talk about?"
"You do the sport?"
"No," said Johnson. "My wife does, though."
"What do you do for amusement?"
"I am a writer."
"Does that make much money?"
"No. But later on when you get known it does."
"It is interesting."
"No," said Johnson, "it is not interesting. I am sorry, gentlemen, but I have to leave you. Will you please drink the other bottle?"
"But the train does not come for three quarters of an hour."
"I know," said Johnson. The waitress came and he paid for the wine and his dinner.
"You're going out, sir?" she asked.
"Yes," said Johnson, "just for a little walk. I'll leave my bags here."
He put on his muffler, his coat, and his hat.
Outside the snow was falling heavily.
He looked back through the window at the three porters sitting at the table.
The waitress was filling their glasses from the last wine of the opened bottle.
She took the unopened bottle back to the bar.
That makes them three francs something apiece, Johnson thought.
He turned and walked down the platform.
Inside the café he had thought that talking about it would blunt it; but it had not blunted it; it had only made him feel nasty.
PART III.
THE SON OF A FELLOW MEMBER AT TERRITET.
In the station café at Territet it was a little too warm; the lights were bright and the tables shiny from polishing.
There were baskets with pretzels in glazed paper sacks on the tables and cardboard pads for beer glasses in order that the moist glasses would not make rings on the wood.
The chairs were carved but the wooden seats were worn and quite comfortable.
There was a clock on the wall, a bar at the far end of the room, and outside the window it was snowing.
There was an old man drinking coffee at a table under the clock and reading the evening paper.
A porter came in and said the Simplon-Orient Express was an hour late at Saint Maurice.
The waitress came over to Mr.
Harris's table.
Harris had just finished dinner.
"The Express is an hour late, sir. Can I bring you some coffee?"
"If you like."
"Please?" asked the waitress.
"All right," said Mr. Harris.
"Thank you, sir," said the waitress.
She brought the coffee from the kitchen and Mr.
Harris put sugar in it, crunched the lumps with his spoon, and looked out the window at the snow falling in the light from the station platform.
"Do you speak other languages besides English?" he asked the waitress.
"Oh, yes, sir. I speak German and French and the dialects."
"Which do you like best?"
"They are all very much the same, sir. I can't say I like one better than another."
"Would you like a drink of something or a coffee?"
"Oh, no, sir, it is not permitted to drink in the café with the clients."
"You wouldn't take a cigar?"
"Oh, no, sir," she laughed. "I don't smoke, sir."
"Neither do I," said Harris, "I don't agree with David Belasco."
"Please?"
"Belasco. David Belasco. You can always tell him because he has his collar on backwards. But I don't agree with him. Then, too, he's dead now."
"Will you excuse me, sir?" asked the waitress.
"Absolutely," said Harris. He sat forward in the chair and looked out of the window. Across the room the old man had folded his paper. He looked at Mr. Harris and then picked up his coffee cup and saucer and walked to Harris's table.
"I beg your pardon if I intrude," he said in English, "but it has just occurred to me that you might be a member of the National Geographic Society."
"Please sit down," Harris said. The gentleman sat down.
"Won't you have another coffee or a liqueur?"
"Thank you," said the gentleman.
"Won't you have a kirsch with me?"
"Perhaps. But you must have it with me."
"No, I insist." Harris called the waitress. The old gentleman took out from an inside pocket of his coat a leather pocketbook. He took off a wide rubber band and drew out several papers, selected one, and handed it to Harris.
"That is my certificate of membership," he said. "Do you know Frederick J. Roussel in America?"
"I'm afraid I don't."
"I believe he is very prominent."
"Where does he come from? Do you know what part of the States?"
"From Washington, of course. Isn't that the headquarters of the Society?"
"I believe it is."
"You believe it is. Aren't you sure?"
"I've been away a long time," Harris said.
"You're not a member, then?"
"No. But my father is. He's been a member for a great many years."
"Then he would know Frederick J. Roussel. He is one of the officers of the society. You will observe that it is by Mr. Roussel that I was nominated for membership."
"I'm awfully glad."
"I am sorry you are not a member. But you could obtain nomination through your father?"
"I think so," said Harris. "I must when I go back."
"I would advise you to," said the gentleman. "You see the magazine, of course?"
"Absolutely."
"Have you seen the number with the colored plates of the North American fauna?"
"Yes. I have it in Paris."
"And the number containing the panorama of the volcanoes of Alaska?"
"That was a wonder."
"I enjoyed very much, too, the wild animal photographs of George Shiras three."
"They were damned fine."
"I beg your pardon?"
"They were excellent. That fellow Shiras----"
"You call him that fellow?"
"We're old friends," said Harris.
"I see. You know George Shiras three. He must be very interesting."
"He is. He's about the most interesting man I know."
"And do you know George Shiras two? Is he interesting too?"
"Oh, he's not so interesting."
"I should imagine he would be very interesting."
"You know, a funny thing. He's not so interesting. I've often wondered why."
"H'm," said the gentleman. "I should have thought any one in that family would be interesting."
"Do you remember the panorama of the Sahara Desert?" Harris asked.
"The Sahara Desert? That was nearly fifteen years ago."
"That's right. That was one of my father's favorites."
"He doesn't prefer the newer numbers?"
"He probably does. But he was very fond of the Sahara panorama."
"It was excellent. But to me its artistic value far exceeded its scientific interest."
"I don't know," said Harris. "The wind blowing all that sand and that Arab with his camel kneeling toward Mecca."
"As I recall, the Arab was standing holding the camel."
"You're quite right," said Harris. "I was thinking of Colonel Lawrence's book."
"Lawrence's book deals with Arabia, I believe."
"Absolutely," said Harris. "It was the Arab reminded me of it."
"He must be a very interesting young man."
"I believe he is."
"Do you know what he is doing now?"
"He's in the Royal Air Force."
"And why does he do that?"
"He likes it."
"Do you know if he belongs to the National Geographic Society?"
"I wonder if he does."
"He would make a very good member. He is the sort of person they want as a member. I would be very happy to nominate him if you think they would like to have him."
"I think they would."
"I have nominated a scientist from Vevey and a colleague of mine from Lauzanne and they were both elected. I believe they would be very pleased if I nominated Colonel Lawrence."
"It's a splendid idea," said Harris. "Do you come here to the café often?"
"I come here for coffee after dinner."
"Are you in the University?"
"I am not active any longer."
"I'm just waiting for the train," said Harris. "I'm going up to Paris and sail from Havre for the States."
"I have never been to America. But I would like to go very much. Perhaps I shall attend a meeting of the society some time. I would be very happy to meet your father."
"I'm sure he would have liked to meet you but he died last year. Shot himself, oddly enough."
"I am very truly sorry. I am sure his loss was a blow to science as well as to his family."
"Science took it awfully well."
"This is my card," Harris said. "His initials were E. J. instead of E. D. I know he would have liked to know you."
"It would have been a great pleasure." The gentleman took out a card from the pocketbook and gave it to Harris. It read:
SIGISMUND WYER, PH.
Member of the National Geographic.
Society, Washington, D.
, U.
"I will keep it very carefully," Harris said.
A DAY'S WAIT.
He came into the room to shut the windows while we were still in bed and I saw he looked ill.
He was shivering, his face was white, and he walked slowly as though it ached to move.
"What's the matter, Schatz?"
"I've got a headache."
"You better go back to bed."
"No. I'm all right."
"You go to bed. I'll see you when I'm dressed."
But when I came downstairs he was dressed, sitting by the fire, looking a very sick and miserable boy of nine years.
When I put my hand on his forehead I knew he had a fever.
"You go up to bed," I said, "you're sick."
"I'm all right," he said.
When the doctor came he took the boy's temperature.
"What is it?" I asked him.
"One hundred and two."
Downstairs, the doctor left three different medicines in different colored capsules with instructions for giving them.
One was to bring down the fever, another a purgative, the third to overcome an acid condition.
The germs of influenza can only exist in an acid condition, he explained.
He seemed to know all about influenza and said there was nothing to worry about if the fever did not go above one hundred and four degrees.
This was a light epidemic of flu and there was no danger if you avoided pneumonia.
Back in the room I wrote the boy's temperature down and made a note of the time to give the various capsules.
"Do you want me to read to you?"
"All right. If you want to," said the boy. His face was very white and there were dark areas under his eyes. He lay still in the bed and seemed very detached from what was going on.
I read aloud from Howard Pyle's Book of Pirates; but I could see he was not following what I was reading.
"How do you feel, Schatz?" I asked him.
"Just the same, so far," he said.
I sat at the foot of the bed and read to myself while I waited for it to be time to give another capsule.
It would have been natural for him to go to sleep, but when I looked up he was looking at the foot of the bed, looking very strangely.
"Why don't you try to go to sleep? I'll wake you up for the medicine."
"I'd rather stay awake."
After a while he said to me, "You don't have to stay in here with me, Papa, if it bothers you.
"It doesn't bother me."
"No, I mean you don't have to stay if it's going to bother you."
I thought perhaps he was a little lightheaded and after giving him the prescribed capsules at eleven o'clock I went out for a while.
It was a bright, cold day, the ground covered with a sleet that had frozen so that it seemed as if all the bare trees, the bushes, the cut brush and all the grass and the bare ground had been varnished with ice.
I took the young Irish setter for a little walk up the road and along a frozen creek, but it was difficult to stand or walk on the glassy surface and the red dog slipped and slithered and I fell twice, hard, once dropping my gun and having it slide away over the ice.
We flushed a covey of quail under a high clay bank with overhanging brush and I killed two as they went out of sight over the top of the bank.
Some of the covey lit in trees, but most of them scattered into brush piles and it was necessary to jump on the ice-coated mounds of brush several times before they would flush.
Coming out while you were poised unsteadily on the icy, springy brush they made difficult shooting and I killed two, missed five, and started back pleased to have found a covey close to the house and happy there were so many left to find on another day.
At the house they said the boy had refused to let any one come into the room.
"You can't come in," he said. "You mustn't get what I have."
I went up to him and found him in exactly the position I had left him, white-faced, but with the tops of his cheeks flushed by the fever, staring still, as he had stared, at the foot of the bed.
I took his temperature.
"What is it?"
"Something like a hundred," I said. It was one hundred and two and four tenths.
"It was a hundred and two," he said.
"Who said so?"
"The doctor."
"Your temperature is all right," I said. "It's nothing to worry about."
"I don't worry," he said, "but I can't keep from thinking."
"Don't think," I said. "Just take it easy."
"I'm taking it easy," he said and looked straight ahead. He was evidently holding tight onto himself about something.
"Take this with water."
"Do you think it will do any good?"
"Of course it will."
I sat down and opened the Pirate book and commenced to read, but I could see he was not following, so I stopped.
"About what time do you think I'm going to die?" he asked.
"What?"
"About how long will it be before I die?"
"You aren't going to die. What's the matter with you?"
"Oh, yes, I am. I heard him say a hundred and two."
"People don't die with a fever of one hundred and two. That's a silly way to talk."
"I know they do. At school in France the boys told me you can't live with forty-four degrees. I've got a hundred and two."
He had been waiting to die all day, ever since nine o'clock in the morning.
"You poor Schatz," I said. "Poor old Schatz. It's like miles and kilometers. You aren't going to die. That's a different thermometer. On that thermometer thirty-seven is normal. On this kind it's ninety-eight."
"Are you sure?"
"Absolutely," I said. "It's like miles and kilometers. You know, like how many kilometers we make when we do seventy miles in the car?"
"Oh," he said.
But his gaze at the foot of the bed relaxed slowly.
The hold over himself relaxed too, finally, and the next day it was very slack and he cried very easily at little things that were of no importance.
A NATURAL HISTORY OF THE DEAD [1].
[Footnote 1] This story was published in a rather technical book called Death in the Afternoon, which sold, or rather was offered for sale, at $3.
It is reprinted here in case any one not caring to spend that appreciable sum for a rather technical book should care to read it.
It has always seemed to me that the war has been omitted as a field for the observations of the naturalist.
We have charming and sound accounts of the flora and fauna of Patagonia by the late W.
Hudson, the Reverend Gilbert White has written most interestingly of the Hoopoe on its occasional and not at all common visits to Selborne, and Bishop Stanley has given us a valuable, although popular, Familiar History of Birds.
Can we not hope to furnish the reader with a few rational and interesting facts about the dead? I hope so.
When that persevering traveller, Mungo Park, was at one period of his course fainting in the vast wilderness of an African desert, naked and alone, considering his days as numbered and nothing appearing to remain for him to do but to lie down and die, a small moss-flower of extraordinary beauty caught his eye.
"Though the whole plant," says he, "was no larger than one of my fingers, I could not contemplate the delicate conformation of its roots, leaves and capsules without admiration.
Can that Being who planted, watered and brought to perfection, in this obscure part of the world, a thing which appears of so small importance, look with unconcern upon the situation and suffering of creatures formed after his own image? Surely not.
Reflections like these would not allow me to despair; I started up and, disregarding both hunger and fatigue, travelled forward, assured that relief was at hand; and I was not disappointed.
With a disposition to wonder and adore in like manner, as Bishop Stanley says, can any branch of Natural History be studied without increasing that faith, love and hope which we also, every one of us, need in our journey through the wilderness of life? Let us therefore see what inspiration we may derive from the dead.
In war the dead are usually the male of the human species although this does not hold true with animals, and I have frequently seen dead mares among the horses.
An interesting aspect of war, too, is that it is only there that the naturalist has an opportunity to observe the dead of mules.
In twenty years of observation in civil life I had never seen a dead mule and had begun to entertain doubts as to whether these animals were really mortal.
On rare occasions I had seen what I took to be dead mules, but on close approach these always proved to be living creatures who seemed to be dead through their quality of complete repose.
But in war these animals succumb in much the same manner as the more common and less hardy horse.
Most of those mules that I saw dead were along mountain roads or lying at the foot of steep declivities whence they had been pushed to rid the road of their encumbrance.
They seemed a fitting enough sight in the mountains where one was accustomed to their presence and looked less incongruous there than they did later, at Smyrna, where the Greeks broke the legs of all their baggage animals and pushed them off the quay into the shallow water to drown.
The numbers of broken-legged mules and horses drowning in the shallow water called for a Goya to depict them.
Although, speaking literally, one can hardly say that they called for a Goya since there has only been one Goya, long dead, and it is extremely doubtful if these animals, were they able to call, would call for pictorial representation of their plight but, more likely, would, if they were articulate, call for some one to alleviate their condition.
Regarding the sex of the dead it is a fact that one becomes so accustomed to the sight of all the dead being men that the sight of a dead woman is quite shocking.
I first saw inversion of the usual sex of the dead after the explosion of a munition factory which had been situated in the countryside near Milan, Italy.
We drove to the scene of the disaster in trucks along poplar-shaded roads, bordered with ditches containing much minute animal life, which I could not clearly observe because of the great clouds of dust raised by the trucks.
Arriving where the munition plant had been, some of us were put to patrolling about those large stocks of munitions which for some reason had not exploded, while others were put at extinguishing a fire which had gotten into the grass of an adjacent field; which task being concluded, we were ordered to search the immediate vicinity and surrounding fields for bodies.
We found and carried to an improvised mortuary a good number of these and, I must admit, frankly, the shock it was to find that these dead were women rather than men.
In those days women had not yet commenced to wear their hair cut short, as they did later for several years in Europe and America, and the most disturbing thing, perhaps because it was the most unaccustomed, was the presence and, even more disturbing, the occasional absence of this long hair.
I remember that after we had searched quite thoroughly for the complete dead we collected fragments.
Many of these were detached from a heavy, barbed-wire fence which had surrounded the position of the factory and from the still existent portions of which we picked many of these detached bits which illustrated only too well the tremendous energy of high explosive.
Many fragments we found a considerable distance away in the fields, they being carried farther by their own weight.
On our return to Milan I recall one or two of us discussing the occurrence and agreeing that the quality of unreality and the fact that there were no wounded did much to rob the disaster of a horror which might have been much greater.
Also the fact that it had been so immediate and that the dead were in consequence still as little unpleasant as possible to carry and deal with made it quite removed from the usual battlefield experience.
The pleasant, though dusty, ride through the beautiful Lombard countryside also was a compensation for the unpleasantness of the duty and on our return, while we exchanged impressions, we all agreed that it was indeed fortunate that the fire which broke out just before we arrived had been brought under control as rapidly as it had and before it had attained any of the seemingly huge stocks of unexploded munitions.
We agreed too that the picking up of the fragments had been an extraordinary business; it being amazing that the human body should be blown into pieces which exploded along no anatomical lines, but rather divided as capriciously as the fragmentation in the burst of a high explosive shell.
A naturalist, to obtain accuracy of observation, may confine himself in his observations to one limited period and I will take first that following the Austrian offensive of June, 1918, in Italy as one in which the dead were present in their greatest numbers, a withdrawal having been forced and an advance later made to recover the ground lost so that the positions after the battle were the same as before except for the presence of the dead.
Until the dead are buried they change somewhat in appearance each day.
The color change in Caucasian races is from white to yellow, to yellow-green, to black.
If left long enough in the heat the flesh comes to resemble coal-tar, especially where it has been broken or torn, and it has quite a visible tarlike iridescence.
The dead grow larger each day until sometimes they become quite too big for their uniforms, filling these until they seem blown tight enough to burst.
The individual members may increase in girth to an unbelievable extent and faces fill as taut and globular as balloons.
The surprising thing, next to their progressive corpulence, is the amount of paper that is scattered about the dead.
Their ultimate position, before there is any question of burial, depends on the location of the pockets in the uniform.
In the Austrian army these pockets were in the back of the breeches and the dead, after a short time, all consequently lay on their faces, the two hip pockets pulled out and, scattered around them in the grass, all those papers their pockets had contained.
The heat, the flies, the indicative positions of the bodies in the grass, and the amount of paper scattered are the impressions one retains.
The smell of a battlefield in hot weather one cannot recall.
You can remember that there was such a smell, but nothing ever happens to you to bring it back.
It is unlike the smell of a regiment, which may come to you suddenly while riding in the street car and you will look across and see the man who has brought it to you.
But the other thing is gone as completely as when you have been in love; you remember things that happened, but the sensation cannot be recalled.
One wonders what that persevering traveller, Mungo Park, would have seen on a battlefield in hot weather to restore his confidence.
There were always poppies in the wheat in the end of June and in July, and the mulberry trees were in full leaf and one could see the heat waves rise from the barrels of the guns where the sun struck them through the screens of leaves; the earth was turned a bright yellow at the edge of holes where mustard gas shells had been and the average broken house is finer to see than one that has never been shelled, but few travellers would take a good full breath of that early summer air and have any such thoughts as Mungo Park about those formed in His own image.
The first thing that you found about the dead was that, hit badly enough, they died like animals.
Some quickly from a little wound you would not think would kill a rabbit.
They died from little wounds as rabbits die sometimes from three or four small grains of shot that hardly seem to break the skin.
Others would die like cats; a skull broken in and iron in the brain, they lie alive two days like cats that crawl into the coal bin with a bullet in the brain and will not die until you cut their heads off.
Maybe cats do not die then, they say they have nine lives, I do not know, but most men die like animals, not men.
I'd never seen a natural death, so called, and so I blamed it on the war and like the persevering traveller, Mungo Park, knew that there was something else, that always absent something else, and then I saw one.
The only natural death I've ever seen, outside of loss of blood, which isn't bad, was death from Spanish influenza.
In this you drown in mucus, choking, and how you know the patient's dead is: at the end he turns to be a little child again, though with his manly force, and fills the sheets as full as any diaper with one vast, final, yellow cataract that flows and dribbles on after he's gone.
So now I want to see the death of any self-called Humanist[2] because a persevering traveller like Mungo Park or me lives on and maybe yet will live to see the actual death of members of this literary sect and watch the noble exits that they make.
In my musings as a naturalist it has occurred to me that while decorum is an excellent thing some must be indecorous if the race is to be carried on since the position prescribed for procreation is indecorous, highly indecorous, and it occurred to me that perhaps that is what these people are, or were: the children of decorous cohabitation.
But regardless of how they started I hope to see the finish of a few, and speculate how worms will try that long preserved sterility; with their quaint pamphlets gone to bust and into foot-notes all their lust.
[Footnote 2] The reader's indulgence is requested for this mention of an extinct phenomenon.
The reference, like all references to fashions, dates the story but it is retained because of its mild historical interest and because its omission would spoil the rhythm.
While it is, perhaps, legitimate to deal with these self-designated citizens in a natural history of the dead, even though the designation may mean nothing by the time this work is published, yet it is unfair to the other dead, who were not dead in their youth of choice, who owned no magazines, many of whom had doubtless never even read a review, that one has seen in the hot weather with a half-pint of maggots working where their mouths have been.
It was not always hot weather for the dead, much of the time it was the rain that washed them clean when they lay in it and made the earth soft when they were buried in it and sometimes then kept on until the earth was mud and washed them out and you had to bury them again.
Or in the winter in the mountains you had to put them in the snow and when the snow melted in the spring some one else had to bury them.
They had beautiful burying grounds in the mountains, war in the mountains is the most beautiful of all war, and in one of them, at a place called Pocol, they buried a general who was shot through the head by a sniper.
This is where those writers are mistaken who write books called Generals Die in Bed, because this general died in a trench dug in snow, high in the mountains, wearing an Alpini hat with an eagle feather in it and a hole in front you couldn't put your little finger in and a hole in back you could put your fist in, if it were a small fist and you wanted to put it there, and much blood in the snow.
He was a damned fine general, and so was General von Behr who commanded the Bavarian Alpenkorps troops at the battle of Caporetto and was killed in his staff car by the Italian rearguard as he drove into Udine ahead of his troops, and the titles of all such books should be Generals Usually Die in Bed, if we are to have any sort of accuracy in such things.
In the mountains too, sometimes, the snow fell on the dead outside the dressing station on the side that was protected by the mountain from any shelling.
They carried them into a cave that had been dug into the mountainside before the earth froze.
It was in this cave that a man whose head was broken as a flower-pot may be broken, although it was all held together by membranes and a skillfully applied bandage now soaked and hardened, with the structure of his brain disturbed by a piece of broken steel in it, lay a day, a night, and a day.
The stretcher-bearers asked the doctor to go in and have a look at him.
They saw him each time they made a trip and even when they did not look at him they heard him breathing.
The doctor's eyes were red and the lids swollen, almost shut from tear gas.
He looked at the man twice; once in daylight, once with a flashlight.
That too would have made a good etching for Goya, the visit with the flashlight, I mean.
After looking at him the second time the doctor believed the stretcher-bearers when they said the soldier was still alive.
"What do you want me to do about it?" he asked.
There was nothing they wanted done.
But after a while they asked permission to carry him out and lay him with the badly wounded.
"No. No. No!" said the doctor, who was busy. "What's the matter? Are you afraid of him?"
"We don't like to hear him in there with the dead."
"Don't listen to him. If you take him out of there you will have to carry him right back in."
"We wouldn't mind that, Captain Doctor."
"No," said the doctor. "No. Didn't you hear me say no?"
"Why don't you give him an overdose of morphine?" asked an artillery officer who was waiting to have a wound in his arm dressed.
"Do you think that is the only use I have for morphine? Would you like me to have to operate without morphine? You have a pistol, go out and shoot him yourself."
"He's been shot already," said the officer. "If some of you doctors were shot you'd be different."
"Thank you very much," said the doctor waving a forceps in the air. "Thank you a thousand times. What about these eyes?" He pointed the forceps at them. "How would you like these?"
"Tear gas. We call it lucky if it's tear gas."
"Because you leave the line," said the doctor. "Because you come running here with your tear gas to be evacuated. You rub onions in your eyes."
"You are beside yourself. I do not notice your insults. You are crazy."
The stretcher-bearers came in.
"Captain Doctor," one of them said.
"Get out of here!" said the doctor.
They went out.
"I will shoot the poor fellow," the artillery officer said. "I am a humane man. I will not let him suffer."
"Shoot him then," said the doctor. "Shoot him. Assume the responsibility. I will make a report. Wounded shot by lieutenant of artillery in first curing post. Shoot him. Go ahead shoot him."
"You are not a human being."
"My business is to care for the wounded, not to kill them. That is for gentlemen of the artillery."
"Why don't you care for him then?"
"I have done so. I have done all that can be done."
"Why don't you send him down on the cable railway?"
"Who are you to ask me questions? Are you my superior officer? Are you in command of this dressing post? Do me the courtesy to answer."
The lieutenant of artillery said nothing.
The others in the room were all soldiers and there were no other officers present.
"Answer me," said the doctor holding a needle up in his forceps. "Give me a response."
"F---- yourself," said the artillery officer.
"So," said the doctor. "So, you said that. All right. All right. We shall see."
The lieutenant of artillery stood up and walked toward him.
"F---- yourself," he said. "F---- yourself. F---- your mother. F---- your sister. . . ."
The doctor tossed the saucer full of iodine in his face.
As he came toward him, blinded, the lieutenant fumbled for his pistol.
The doctor skipped quickly behind him, tripped him and, as he fell to the floor, kicked him several times and picked up the pistol in his rubber gloves.
The lieutenant sat on the floor holding his good hand to his eyes.
"I'll kill you!" he said. "I'll kill you as soon as I can see."
"I am the boss," said the doctor. "All is forgiven since you know I am the boss. You cannot kill me because I have your pistol. Sergeant! Adjutant! Adjutant!"
"The adjutant is at the cable railway," said the sergeant.
"Wipe out this officer's eyes with alcohol and water. He has got iodine in them. Bring me the basin to wash my hands. I will take this officer next."
"You won't touch me."
"Hold him tight. He is a little delirious."
One of the stretcher-bearers came in.
"Captain Doctor."
"What do you want?"
"The man in the dead-house----"
"Get out of here."
"Is dead, Captain Doctor. I thought you would be glad to know."
"See, my poor lieutenant? We dispute about nothing. In time of war we dispute about nothing."
"F---- you," said the lieutenant of artillery. He still could not see. "You've blinded me."
"It is nothing," said the doctor. "Your eyes will be all right. It is nothing. A dispute about nothing."
"Ayee! Ayee! Ayee!" suddenly screamed the lieutenant. "You have blinded me! You have blinded me!"
"Hold him tight," said the doctor. "He is in much pain. Hold him very tight."
WINE OF WYOMING.
It was a hot afternoon in Wyoming; the mountains were a long way away and you could see snow on their tops, but they made no shadow, and in the valley the grain-fields were yellow, the road was dusty with cars passing, and all the small wooden houses at the edge of town were baking in the sun.
There was a tree made shade over Fontan's back porch and I sat there at a table and Madame Fontan brought up cold beer from the cellar.
A motor-car turned off the main road and came up the side road, and stopped beside the house.
Two men got out and came in through the gate.
I put the bottles under the table.
Madame Fontan stood up.
"Where's Sam?" one of the men asked at the screen door.
"He ain't here. He's at the mines."
"You got some beer?"
"No. Ain't got any beer. That's a last bottle. All gone."
"What's he drinking?"
"That's a last bottle. All gone."
"Go on, give us some beer. You know me."
"Ain't got any beer. That's a last bottle. All gone."
"Come on, let's go some place where we can get some real beer," one of them said, and they went out to the car. One of them walked unsteadily. The motor-car jerked in starting, whirled on the road, and went on and away.
"Put the beer on the table," Madame Fontan said. "What's the matter, yes, all right. What's the matter? Don't drink off the floor."
"I didn't know who they were," I said.
"They're drunk," she said. "That's what makes the trouble. Then they go somewhere else and say they got it here. Maybe they don't even remember." She spoke French, but it was only French occasionally, and there were many English words and some English constructions.
"Where's Fontan?"
"Il fait de la vendange. Oh, my God, il est crazy pour le vin."
"But you like the beer?"
"Oui, j'aime la bière, mais Fontan, il est crazy pour le vin."
She was a plump old woman with a lovely ruddy complexion and white hair.
She was very clean and the house was very clean and neat.
She came from Lens.
"Where did you eat?"
"At the hotel."
"Mangez ici. Il ne faut pas manger à l'hôtel ou au restaurant. Mangez ici!"
"I don't want to make you trouble. And besides they eat all right at the hotel."
"I never eat at the hotel. Maybe they eat all right there. Only once in my life I ate at a restaurant in America. You know what they gave me? They gave me pork that was raw!"
"Really?"
"I don't lie to you. It was pork that wasn't cooked! Et mon fils il est marié avec une américaine, et tout le temps il a mangé les beans en can."
"How long has he been married?"
"Oh, my God, I don't know. His wife weighs two hundred twenty-five pounds. She don't work. She don't cook. She gives him beans en can."
"What does she do?"
"All the time she reads. Rien que des books. Tout le temps elle stay in the bed and read books. Already she can't have another baby. She's too fat. There ain't any room."
"What's the matter with her?"
"She reads books all the time. He's a good boy. He works hard. He worked in the mines; now he works on a ranch. He never worked on a ranch before, and the man that owns the ranch said to Fontan that he never saw anybody work better on that ranch than that boy. Then he comes home and she feeds him nothing."
"Why doesn't he get a divorce?"
"He ain't got no money to get a divorce. Besides, il est crazy pour elle."
"Is she beautiful?"
"He thinks so. When he brought her home I thought I would die. He's such a good boy and works hard all the time and never run around or make any trouble. Then he goes away to work in the oil-fields and brings home this Indienne that weighs right then one hundred eighty-five pounds."
"Elle est Indienne?"
"She's Indian all right. My God, yes. All the time she says sonofabitsh goddam. She don't work."
"Where is she now?"
"Au show."
"Where's that?"
"Au show. Moving pictures. All she does is read and go to the show."
"Have you got any more beer?"
"My God, yes. Sure. You come and eat with us tonight."
"All right. What should I bring?"
"Don't bring anything. Nothing at all. Maybe Fontan will have some of the wine."
* * * * *.
That night I had dinner at Fontan's.
We ate in the dining-room and there was a clean tablecloth.
We tried the new wine.
It was very light and clear and good, and still tasted of the grapes.
At the table there were Fontan and Madame and the little boy, André.
"What did you do today?" Fontan asked. He was an old man with small mine-tired body, a drooping gray mustache, and bright eyes, and was from the Centre near Saint-Etienne.
"I worked on my book."
"Were your books all right?" asked Madame.
"He means he writes a book like a writer. Un roman," Fontan explained.
"Pa, can I go to the show?" André asked.
"Sure," said Fontan. André turned to me.
"How old do you think I am? Do you think I look fourteen years old?" He was a thin little boy, but his face looked sixteen.
"Yes. You look fourteen."
"When I go to the show I crouch down like this and try to look small." His voice was very high and breaking. "If I give them a quarter they keep it all but if I give them only fifteen cents they let me in all right."
"I only give you fifteen cents, then," said Fontan.
"No. Give me the whole quarter. I'll get it changed on the way."
"Il faut revenir tout de suite après le show," Madame Fontan said.
"I come right back." André went out the door. The night was cooling outside. He left the door open and a cool breeze came in.
"Mangez!" said Madame Fontan. "You haven't eaten anything." I had eaten two helpings of chicken and French fried potatoes, three ears of sweet corn, some sliced cucumbers, and two helpings of salad.
"Perhaps he wants some kek," Fontan said.
"I should have gotten some kek for him," Madame Fontan said. "Mangez du fromage. Mangez du crimcheez. Vous n'avez rien mangé. I ought have gotten kek. Americans always eat kek."
"Mais j'ai rudement bien mangé."
"Mangez! Vous n'avez rien mangé. Eat it all. We don't save anything. Eat it all up."
"Eat some more salad," Fontan said.
"I'll get some more beer," Madame Fontan said. "If you work all day in a book-factory you get hungry."
"Elle ne comprend pas que vous êtes écrivain," Fontan said. He was a delicate old man who used the slang and knew the popular songs of his period of military service in the end of the 1890's. "He writes the books himself," he explained to Madame.
"You write the books yourself?" Madame asked.
"Sometimes."
"Oh!" she said. "Oh! You write them yourself. Oh! Well, you get hungry if you do that too. Mangez! Je vais chercher de la bière."
We heard her walking on the stairs to the cellar.
Fontan smiled at me.
He was very tolerant of people who had not his experience and worldly knowledge.
When André came home from the show we were still sitting in the kitchen and were talking about hunting.
"Labor day we all went to Clear Creek," Madame said. "Oh, my God, you ought to have been there all right. We all went in the truck. Tout le monde est allé dans le truck. Nous sommes partis le dimanche. C'est le truck de Charley."
"On a mangé, on a bu du vin, de la bière, et il y avait aussi un français qui a apporté de l'absinthe," Fontan said. "Un français de la Californie!"
"My God, nous avons chanté. There's a farmer comes to see what's the matter, and we give him something to drink, and he stayed with us awhile. There was some Italians come too, and they want to stay with us too. We sung a song about the Italians and they don't understand it. They didn't know we didn't want them, but we didn't have nothing to do with them, and after a while they went away."
"How many fish did you catch?"
"Très peu. We went to fish a little while, but then we came back to sing again. Nous avons chanté, vous savez."
"In the night," said Madame, "toutes les femmes dort dans le truck. Les hommes à côté du feu. In the night I hear Fontan come to get some more wine, and I tell him, Fontan, my God, leave some for tomorrow. Tomorrow they won't have anything to drink, and then they'll be sorry."
"Mais nous avons tout bu," Fontan said. "Et le lendemain il ne reste rien."
"What did you do?"
"Nous avons pêché sérieusement."
"Good trout, all right, too. My God, yes. All the same; half-pound one ounce."
"How big?"
"Half-pound one ounce. Just right to eat. All the same size; half-pound one ounce."
"How do you like America?" Fontan asked me.
"It's my country, you see. So I like it, because it's my country. Mais on ne mange pas très bien. D'antan, oui. Mais maintenant, no."
"No," said Madame. "On ne mange pas bien." She shook her head. "Et aussi, il y a trop de Polack. Quand j'étais petite ma mère m'a dit, 'vous mangez comme les Polacks.' Je n'ai jamais compris ce que c'est qu'un Polack. Mais maintenant en Amérique je comprends. Il y a trop de Polack. Et, my God, ils sont sales, les Polacks."
"It is fine for hunting and fishing," I said.
"Oui. Ça, c'est le meilleur. La chasse et la pêche," Fontan said. "Qu'est-ce que vous avez comme fusil?"
"A twelve-gauge pump."
"Il est bon, le pump," Fontan nodded his head.
"Je veux aller à la chasse moi-même," André said in his high, little boy's voice.
"Tu ne peux pas," Fontan said. He turned to me.
"Ils sont des sauvages, les boys, vous savez. Ils sont des sauvages. Ils veulent shooter les uns les autres."
"Je veux aller tout seul," André said, very shrill and excited.
"You can't go," Madame Fontan said. "You are too young."
"Je veux aller tout seul," André said shrilly. "Je veux shooter les rats d'eau."
"What are rats d'eau?" I asked.
"You don't know them? Sure you know them. What they call the muskrats."
André had brought the twenty-two-calibre rifle out from the cupboard and was holding it in his hands under the light.
"Ils sont des sauvages," Fontan explained. "Ils veulent shooter les uns les autres."
"Je veux aller tout seul," André shrilled. He looked desperately along the barrel of the gun. "Je veux shooter les rats d'eau. Je connais beaucoup de rats d'eau."
"Give me the gun," Fontan said. He explained again to me. "They're savages. They would shoot one another."
André held tight on to the gun.
"On peut looker. On ne fait pas de mal. On peut looker."
"Il est crazy pour le shooting," Madame Fontan said. "Mais il est trop jeune."
André put the twenty-two-calibre rifle back in the cupboard.
"When I'm bigger I'll shoot the muskrats and the jack-rabbits too," he said in English. "One time I went out with papa and he shot a jack-rabbit just a little bit and I shot it and hit it."
"C'est vrai," Fontan nodded. "Il a tué un jack."
"But he hit it first," André said. "I want to go all by myself and shoot all by myself. Next year I can do it." He went over in a corner and sat down to read a book. I had picked it up when we came into the kitchen to sit after supper. It was a library book--Frank on a Gunboat.
"Il aime les books," Madame Fontan said. "But it's better than to run around at night with the other boys and steal things."
"Books are all right," Fontan said. "Monsieur il fait les books."
"Yes, that's so, all right. But too many books are bad," Madame Fontan said. "Ici, c'est une maladie, les books. C'est comme les churches. Ici il y a trop de churches. En France il y a seulement les catholiques et les protestants--et très peu de protestants. Mais ici rien que de churches. Quand j'étais venu ici je disais, oh, my God, what are all the churches?"
"C'est vrai," Fontan said. "Il y a trop de churches."
"The other day," Madame Fontan said, "there was a little French girl here with her mother, the cousin of Fontan, and she said to me, 'En Amérique il ne faut pas être catholique. It's not good to be catholique. The Americans don't like you to be catholique. It's like the dry law.' I said to her, 'What you going to be? Heh? It's better to be catholique if you're catholique.' But she said, 'No, it isn't any good to be catholique in America.' But I think it's better to be catholique if you are. Ce n'est pas bon de changer sa religion. My God, no."
"You go to the mass here?"
"No. I don't go in America, only sometimes in a long while. Mais je reste catholique. It's no good to change the religion."
"On dit que Schmidt est catholique," Fontan said.
"On dit, mais on ne sait jamais," Madame Fontan said. "I don't think Schmidt is catholique. There's not many catholique in America."
"We are catholique," I said.
"Sure, but you live in France," Madame Fontan said. "Je ne crois pas que Schmidt est catholique. Did he ever live in France?"
"Les Polacks sont catholiques," Fontan said.
"That's true," Madame Fontan said. "They go to church, then they fight with knives all the way home and kill each other all day Sunday. But they're not real catholiques. They're Polack catholiques."
"All catholiques are the same," Fontan said. "One catholique is like another."
"I don't believe Schmidt is catholique," Madame Fontan said. "That's awful funny if he's catholique. Moi, je ne crois pas."
"Il est catholique," I said.
"Schmidt is catholique," Madame Fontan mused. "I wouldn't have believed it. My God, il est catholique."
"Marie va chercher de la bière," Fontan said. "Monsieur a soif--moi aussi."
"Yes, all right," Madame Fontan said from the next room. She went downstairs and we heard the stairs creaking. André sat reading in the corner. Fontan and I sat at the table, and he poured the beer from the last bottle into our two glasses, leaving a little in the bottom.
"C'est un bon pays pour la chasse," Fontan said. "J'aime beaucoup shooter les canards."
"Mais il y a très bonne chasse aussi en France," I said.
"C'est vrai," Fontan said. "Nous avons beaucoup de gibier là-bas."
Madame Fontan came up the stairs with the beer bottles in her hands.
"Il est catholique," she said.
"My God, Schmidt est catholique.
"You think he'll be the President?" Fontan asked.
"No," I said.
* * * * *.
The next afternoon I drove out to Fontan's, through the shade of the town, then along the dusty road, turning up the side road and leaving the car beside the fence.
It was another hot day.
Madame Fontan came to the back door.
She looked like Mrs.
Santa Claus, clean and rosy-faced and white-haired, and waddling when she walked.
"My God, hello," she said. "It's hot, my God." She went back into the house to get some beer. I sat on the back porch and looked through the screen and the leaves of the tree at the heat and, away off, the mountains. There were furrowed brown mountains, and above them three peaks and a glacier with snow that you could see through the trees. The snow looked very white and pure and unreal. Madame Fontan came out and put down the bottles on the table.
"What you see out there?"
"The snow."
"C'est joli, la neige."
"Have a glass, too."
"All right."
She sat down on a chair beside me.
"Schmidt," she said.
"If he's the President, you think we get the wine and beer all right?".
"Sure," I said. "Trust Schmidt."
"Already we paid seven hundred fifty-five dollars in fines when they arrested Fontan. Twice the police arrested us and once the governments. All the money we made all the time Fontan worked in the mines and I did washing. We paid it all. They put Fontan in jail. Il n'a jamais fait de mal à personne."
"He's a good man," I said. "It's a crime."
"We don't charge too much money. The wine one dollar a litre. The beer ten cents a bottle. We never sell the beer before it's good. Lots of places they sell the beer right away when they make it, and then it gives everybody a headache. What's the matter with that? They put Fontan in jail and they take seven hundred fifty-five dollars."
"It's wicked," I said. "Where is Fontan?"
"He stays with the wine. He has to watch it now to catch it just right," she smiled. She did not think about the money any more. "Vous savez, il est crazy pour le vin. Last night he brought a little bit home with him, what you drank, and a little bit of the new. The last new. It ain't ready yet, but he drank a little bit, and this morning he put a little bit in his coffee. Dans son café, vous savez! Il est crazy pour le vin! Il est comme ça. Son pays est comme ça. Where I live in the north they don't drink any wine. Everybody drinks beer. By where we lived there was a big brewery right near us. When I was a little girl I didn't like the smell of the hops in the carts. Nor in the fields. Je n'aime pas les houblons. No, my God, not a bit. The man that owns the brewery said to me and my sister to go to the brewery and drink the beer, and then we'd like the hops. That's true. Then we liked them all right. He had them give us the beer. We liked them all right then. But Fontan, il est crazy pour le vin. One time he killed a jack-rabbit and he wanted me to cook it with a sauce with wine, make a black sauce with wine and butter and mushrooms and onion and everything in it, for the jack. My God, I make the sauce all right, and he eat it all and said, 'La sauce est meilleure que le jack.' Dans son pays c'est comme ça. Il y a beaucoup de gibier et de vin. Moi, j'aime les pommes de terre, le saucisson, et la bière. C'est bon, la bière. C'est très bon pour la santé."
"It's good," I said. "It and wine too."
"You're like Fontan. But there was a thing here that I never saw. I don't think you've ever seen it either. There were Americans came here and they put whiskey in the beer."
"No," I said.
"Oui. My God, yes, that's true. Et aussi une femme qui a vomis sur la table!"
"Comment?"
"C'est vrai. Elle a vomis sur la table. Et après elle a vomis dans ses shoes. And afterward they come back and say they want to come again and have another party the next Saturday, and I say no, my God, no! When they came I locked the door."
"They're bad when they're drunk."
"In the winter-time when the boys go to the dance they come in the cars and wait outside and say to Fontan, 'Hey, Sam, sell us a bottle wine,' or they buy the beer, and then they take the moonshine out of their pockets in a bottle and pour it in the beer and drink it. My God, that's the first time I ever saw that in my life. They put whiskey in the beer. My God, I don't understand that!"
"They want to get sick, so they'll know they're drunk."
"One time a fellow comes here came to me and said he wanted me to cook them a big supper and they drink one two bottles of wine, and their girls come too, and then they go to the dance. All right, I said. So I made a big supper, and when they come already they drank a lot. Then they put whiskey in the wine. My God, yes. I said to Fontan, 'On va être malade!' 'Oui,' il dit. Then these girls were sick, nice girls too, all-right girls. They were sick right at the table. Fontan tried to take them by the arm and show them where they could be sick all right in the cabinet, but the fellows said no, they were all right right there at the table."
Fontan had come in.
"When they come again I locked the door.
'No,' I said.
'Not for hundred fifty dollars.
' My God, no.
"There is a word for such people when they do like that, in French," Fontan said. He stood looking very old and tired from the heat.
"What?"
"Cochon," he said delicately, hesitating to use such a strong word. "They were like the cochon. C'est un mot très fort," he apologized, "mais vomir sur la table--" he shook his head sadly.
"Cochons," I said. "That's what they are--cochons. Salauds."
The grossness of the words was distasteful to Fontan.
He was glad to speak of something else.
"Il y a des gens très gentils, très sensibles, qui viennent aussi," he said. "There are officers from the fort. Very nice men. Good fellas. Everybody that was ever in France they want to come and drink wine. They like wine all right."
"There was one man," Madame Fontan said, "and his wife never lets him get out. So he tells her he's tired, and goes to bed, and when she goes to the show he comes straight down here, sometimes in his pyjamas just with a coat over them. 'Maria, some beer,' he says, 'for God's sake.' He sits in his pyjamas and drinks the beer, and then he goes up to the fort and gets back in bed before his wife comes home from the show."
"C'est un original," Fontan said, "mais vraiment gentil. He's a nice fella."
"My God, yes, nice fella all right," Madame Fontan said. "He's always in bed when his wife gets back from the show."
"I have to go away tomorrow," I said. "To the Crow Reservation. We go there for the opening of the prairie-chicken season."
"Yes? You come back here before you go away. You come back here all right?"
"Absolutely."
"Then the wine will be done," Fontan said. "We'll drink a bottle together."
"Three bottles," Madame Fontan said.
"I'll be back," I said.
"We count on you," Fontan said.
"Good night," I said.
* * * * *.
We got in early in the afternoon from the shooting-trip.
We had been up that morning since five o'clock.
The day before we had had good shooting, but that morning we had not seen a prairie-chicken.
Riding in the open car, we were very hot and we stopped to eat our lunch out of the sun, under a tree beside the road.
The sun was high and the patch of shade was very small.
We ate sandwiches and crackers with sandwich filling on them, and were thirsty and tired, and glad when we finally were out and on the main road back to town.
We came up behind a prairie-dog town and stopped the car to shoot at the prairie-dogs with the pistol.
We shot two, but then stopped, because the bullets that missed glanced off the rocks and the dirt, and sung off across the fields, and beyond the fields there were some trees along a watercourse, with a house, and we did not want to get in trouble from stray bullets going toward the house.
So we drove on, and finally were on the road coming down-hill toward the outlying houses of the town.
Across the plain we could see the mountains.
They were blue that day, and the snow on the high mountains shone like glass.
The summer was ending, but the new snow had not yet come to stay on the high mountains; there was only the old sun-melted snow and the ice, and from a long way away it shone very brightly.
We wanted something cool and some shade.
We were sunburned and our lips blistered from the sun and alkali dust.
We turned up the side road to Fontan's, stopped the car outside the house, and went in.
It was cool inside the dining-room.
Madame Fontan was alone.
"Only two bottles beer," she said. "It's all gone. The new is no good yet."
I gave her some birds.
"That's good," she said.
"All right.
Thanks.
That's good.
" She went out to put the birds away where it was cooler.
When we finished the beer I stood up.
"We have to go," I said.
"You come back tonight all right? Fontan he's going to have the wine."
"We'll come back before we go away."
"You go away?"
"Yes. We have to leave in the morning."
"That's too bad you go away. You come tonight. Fontan will have the wine. We'll make a fête before you go."
"We'll come before we go."
But that afternoon there were telegrams to send, the car to be gone over,--a tire had been cut by a stone and needed vulcanizing,--and, without the car, I walked into the town, doing things that had to be done before we could go.
When it was supper-time I was too tired to go out.
We did not want a foreign language.
All we wanted was to go early to bed.
As I lay in bed before I went to sleep, with all the things of the summer piled around ready to be packed, the windows open and the air coming in cool from the mountains, I thought it was a shame not to have gone to Fontan's--but in a little while I was asleep.
The next day we were busy all morning packing and ending the summer.
We had lunch and were ready to start by two o'clock.
"We must go and say good-by to the Fontans," I said.
"Yes, we must."
"I'm afraid they expected us last night."
"I suppose we could have gone."
"I wish we'd gone."
We said good-by to the man at the desk at the hotel, and to Larry and our other friends in the town, and then drove out to Fontan's.
Both Monsieur and Madame were there.
They were glad to see us.
Fontan looked old and tired.
"We thought you would come last night," Madame Fontan said. "Fontan had three bottles of wine. When you did not come he drank it all up."
"We can only stay a minute," I said. "We just came to say good-by. We wanted to come last night. We intended to come, but we were too tired after the trip."
"Go get some wine," Fontan said.
"There is no wine. You drank it all up."
Fontan looked very upset.
"I'll go get some," he said. "I'll just be gone a few minutes. I drank it up last night. We had it for you."
"I knew you were tired. 'My God,' I said, 'they're too tired all right to come,'" Madame Fontan said. "Go get some wine, Fontan."
"I'll take you in the car," I said.
"All right," Fontan said. "That way we'll go faster."
We drove down the road in the motor-car and turned up a side road about a mile away.
"You'll like that wine," Fontan said. "It's come out well. You can drink it for supper tonight."
We stopped in front of a frame house.
Fontan knocked on the door.
There was no answer.
We went around to the back.
The back door was locked too.
There were empty tin cans around the back door.
We looked in the window.
There was nobody inside.
The kitchen was dirty and sloppy, but all the doors and windows were tight shut.
"That son of a bitch. Where is she gone out?" Fontan said. He was desperate.
"I know where I can get a key," he said. "You stay here." I watched him go down to the next house down the road, knock on the door, talk to the woman who came out, and finally come back. He had a key. We tried it on the front door and the back, but it wouldn't work.
"That son of a bitch," Fontan said. "She's gone away somewhere."
Looking through the window I could see where the wine was stored.
Close to the window you could smell the inside of the house.
It smelled sweet and sickish like an Indian house.
Suddenly Fontan took a loose board and commenced digging at the earth beside the back door.
"I can get in," he said. "Son of a bitch, I can get in."
There was a man in the back yard of the next house doing something to one of the front wheels of an old Ford.
"You better not," I said. "That man will see you. He's watching."
Fontan straightened up.
"We'll try the key once more," he said.
We tried the key and it did not work.
It turned half-way in either direction.
"We can't get in," I said. "We better go back."
"I'll dig up the back," Fontan offered.
"No, I wouldn't let you take the chance."
"I'll do it."
"No," I said. "That man would see. Then they would seize it."
We went out to the car and drove back to Fontan's, stopping on the way to leave the key.
Fontan did not say anything but swear in English.
He was incoherent and crushed.
We went in the house.
"That son of a bitch!" he said. "We couldn't get the wine. My own wine that I made."
All the happiness went from Madame Fontan's face.
Fontan sat down in a corner with his head in his hands.
"We must go," I said. "It doesn't make any difference about the wine. You drink to us when we're gone."
"Where did that crazy go?" Madame Fontan asked.
"I don't know," Fontan said. "I don't know where she go. Now you go away without any wine."
"That's all right," I said.
"That's no good," Madame Fontan said. She shook her head.
"We have to go," I said. "Good-by and good luck. Thank you for the fine times."
Fontan shook his head.
He was disgraced.
Madame Fontan looked sad.
"Don't feel bad about the wine," I said.
"He wanted you to drink his wine," Madame Fontan said. "You can come back next year?"
"No. Maybe the year after."
"You see?" Fontan said to her.
"Good-by," I said. "Don't think about the wine. Drink some for us when we're gone." Fontan shook his head. He did not smile. He knew when he was ruined.
"That son of a bitch," Fontan said to himself.
"Last night he had three bottles," Madame Fontan said to comfort him. He shook his head.
"Good-by," he said.
Madame Fontan had tears in her eyes.
"Good-by," she said. She felt badly for Fontan.
"Good-by," we said. We all felt very badly. They stood in the doorway and we got in, and I started the motor. We waved. They stood together sadly on the porch. Fontan looked very old, and Madame Fontan looked sad. She waved to us and Fontan went in the house. We turned up the road.
"They felt so badly. Fontan felt terribly."
"We ought to have gone last night."
"Yes, we ought to have."
We were through the town and out on the smooth road beyond, with the stubble of grain-fields on each side and the mountains off to the right.
It looked like Spain, but it was Wyoming.
"I hope they have a lot of good luck."
"They won't," I said, "and Schmidt won't be President either."
The cement road stopped.
The road was gravelled now and we left the plain and started up between two foot-hills; the road in a curve and commencing to climb.
The soil of the hills was red, the sage grew in gray clumps, and as the road rose we could see across the hills and away across the plain of the valley to the mountains.
They were farther away now and they looked more like Spain than ever.
The road curved and climbed again, and ahead there were some grouse dusting in the road.
They flew as we came toward them, their wings beating fast, then sailing in long slants, and lit on the hillside below.
"They are so big and lovely. They're bigger than European partridges."
"It's a fine country for la chasse, Fontan says."
"And when the chasse is gone?"
"They'll be dead then."
"The boy won't."
"There's nothing to prove he won't be," I said.
"We ought to have gone last night."
"Oh, yes," I said. "We ought to have gone."
THE GAMBLER, THE NUN, AND THE RADIO.
They brought them in around midnight and then, all night long, every one along the corridor heard the Russian.
"Where is he shot?" Mr. Frazer asked the night nurse.
"In the thigh, I think."
"What about the other one?"
"Oh, he's going to die, I'm afraid."
"Where is he shot?"
"Twice in the abdomen. They only found one of the bullets."
They were both beet workers, a Mexican and a Russian, and they were sitting drinking coffee in an all-night restaurant when some one came in the door and started shooting at the Mexican.
The Russian crawled under a table and was hit, finally, by a stray shot fired at the Mexican as he lay on the floor with two bullets in his abdomen.
That was what the paper said.
The Mexican told the police he had no idea who shot him.
He believed it to be an accident.
"An accident that he fired eight shots at you and hit you twice, there?"
"Si, señor," said the Mexican, who was named Cayetano Ruiz.
"An accident that he hit me at all, the cabron," he said to the interpreter.
"What does he say?" asked the detective sergeant, looking across the bed at the interpreter.
"He says it was an accident."
"Tell him to tell the truth, that he is going to die," the detective said.
"Na," said Cayetano. "But tell him that I feel very sick and would prefer not to talk so much."
"He says that he is telling the truth," the interpreter said. Then, speaking confidently, to the detective, "He don't know who shot him. They shot him in the back."
"Yes," said the detective. "I understand that, but why did the bullets all go in the front?"
"Maybe he is spinning around," said the interpreter.
"Listen," said the detective, shaking his finger almost at Cayetano's nose, which projected, waxen yellow, from his dead-man's face in which his eyes were alive as a hawk's. "I don't give a damn who shot you, but I've got to clear this thing up. Don't you want the man who shot you to be punished? Tell him that," he said to the interpreter.
"He says to tell who shot you."
"Mandarlo al carajo," said Cayetano, who was very tired.
"He says he never saw the fellow at all," the interpreter said. "I tell you straight they shot him in the back."
"Ask him who shot the Russian."
"Poor Russian," said Cayetano. "He was on the floor with his head enveloped in his arms. He started to give cries when they shoot him and he is giving cries ever since. Poor Russian."
"He says some fellow that he doesn't know. Maybe the same fellow that shot him."
"Listen," the detective said. "This isn't Chicago. You're not a gangster. You don't have to act like a moving picture. It's all right to tell who shot you. Anybody would tell who shot them. That's all right to do. Suppose you don't tell who he is and he shoots somebody else. Suppose he shoots a woman or a child. You can't let him get away with that. You tell him," he said to Mr. Frazer. "I don't trust that damn interpreter."
"I am very reliable," the interpreter said. Cayetano looked at Mr. Frazer.
"Listen, amigo," said Mr. Frazer. "The policeman says that we are not in Chicago but in Hailey, Montana. You are not a bandit and this has nothing to do with the cinema."
"I believe him," said Cayetano softly. "Ya lo creo."
"One can, with honor, denounce one's assailant. Every one does it here, he says. He says what happens if after shooting you, this man shoots a woman or a child?"
"I am not married," Cayetano said.
"He says any woman, any child."
"The man is not crazy," Cayetano said.
"He says you should denounce him," Mr. Frazer finished.
"Thank you," Cayetano said. "You are of the great translators. I speak English, but badly. I understand it all right. How did you break your leg?"
"A fall off a horse."
"What bad luck. I am very sorry. Does it hurt much?"
"Not now. At first, yes."
"Listen, amigo," Cayetano began, "I am very weak. You will pardon me. Also I have much pain; enough pain. It is very possible that I die. Please get this policeman out of here because I am very tired." He made as though to roll to one side; then held himself still.
"I told him everything exactly as you said and he said to tell you, truly, that he doesn't know who shot him and that he is very weak and wishes you would question him later on," Mr. Frazer said.
"He'll probably be dead later on."
"That's quite possible."
"That's why I want to question him now."
"Somebody shot him in the back, I tell you," the interpreter said.
"Oh, for Chrisake," the detective sergeant said, and put his notebook in his pocket.
* * * * *.
Outside in the corridor the detective sergeant stood with the interpreter beside Mr.
Frazer's wheeled chair.
"I suppose you think somebody shot him in the back too?"
"Yes," Frazer said. "Somebody shot him in the back. What's it to you?"
"Don't get sore," the sergeant said. "I wish I could talk spik."
"Why don't you learn?"
"You don't have to get sore. I don't get any fun out of asking that spik questions. If I could talk spik it would be different."
"You don't need to talk Spanish," the interpreter said. "I am a very reliable interpreter."
"Oh, for Chrisake," the sergeant said. "Well, so long. I'll come up and see you."
"Thanks. I'm always in."
"I guess you are all right. That was bad luck all right. Plenty bad luck."
"It's coming along good now since he spliced the bone."
"Yes, but it's a long time. A long, long time."
"Don't let anybody shoot you in the back."
"That's right," he said. "That's right. Well, I'm glad you're not sore."
"So long," said Mr. Frazer.
* * * * *.
Frazer did not see Cayetano again for a long time, but each morning Sister Cecilia brought news of him.
He was so uncomplaining she said and he was very bad now.
He had peritonitis and they thought he could not live.
Poor Cayetano, she said.
He had such beautiful hands and such a fine face and he never complains.
The odor, now, was really terrific.
He would point toward his nose with one finger and smile and shake his head, she said.
He felt badly about the odor.
It embarrassed him, Sister Cecilia said.
Oh, he was such a fine patient.
He always smiled.
He wouldn't go to confession to Father but he promised to say his prayers, and not a Mexican had been to see him since he had been brought in.
The Russian was going out at the end of the week.
I could never feel anything about the Russian, Sister Cecilia said.
Poor fellow, he suffered too.
It was a greased bullet and dirty and the wound infected, but he made so much noise and then I always like the bad ones.
That Cayetano, he's a bad one.
Oh, he must really be a bad one, a thoroughly bad one, he's so fine and delicately made and he's never done any work with his hands.
He's not a beet worker.
I know he's not a beet worker.
His hands are as smooth and not a callous on them.
I know he's a bad one of some sort.
I'm going down and pray for him now.
Poor Cayetano, he's having a dreadful time and he doesn't make a sound.
What did they have to shoot him for? Oh, that poor Cayetano! I'm going right down and pray for him.
She went right down and prayed for him.
* * * * *.
In that hospital a radio did not work very well until it was dusk.
They said it was because there was so much ore in the ground or something about the mountains, but anyway it did not work well at all until it began to get dark outside; but all night it worked beautifully and when one station stopped you could go farther west and pick up another.
The last one that you could get was Seattle, Washington, and due to the difference in time, when they signed off at four o'clock in the morning it was five o'clock in the morning in the hospital; and at six o'clock you could get the morning revellers in Minneapolis.
That was on account of the difference in time, too, and Mr.
Frazer used to like to think of the morning revellers arriving at the studio and picture how they would look getting off a street car before daylight in the morning carrying their instruments.
Maybe that was wrong and they kept their instruments at the place they revelled, but he always pictured them with their instruments.
He had never been in Minneapolis and believed he probably would never go there, but he knew what it looked like that early in the morning.
Out of the window of the hospital you could see a field with tumbleweed coming out of the snow, and a bare clay butte.
One morning the doctor wanted to show Mr.
Frazer two pheasants that were out there in the snow, and pulling the bed toward the window, the reading light fell off the iron bedstead and hit Mr.
Frazer on the head.
This does not sound so funny now but it was very funny then.
Every one was looking out the window, and the doctor, who was a most excellent doctor, was pointing at the pheasants and pulling the bed toward the window, and then, just as in a comic section, Mr.
Frazer was knocked out by the leaded base of the lamp hitting the top of his head.
It seemed the antithesis of healing or whatever people were in the hospital for, and every one thought it was very funny, as a joke on Mr.
Frazer and on the doctor.
Everything is much simpler in a hospital, including the jokes.
From the other window, if the bed was turned, you could see the town, with a little smoke above it, and the Dawson mountains looking like real mountains with the winter snow on them.
Those were the two views since the wheeled chair had proved to be premature.
It is really best to be in bed if you are in a hospital; since two views, with time to observe them, from a room the temperature of which you control, are much better than any number of views seen for a few minutes from hot, empty rooms that are waiting for some one else, or just abandoned, which you are wheeled in and out of.
If you stay long enough in a room the view, whatever it is, acquires a great value and becomes very important and you would not change it, not even by a different angle.
Just as, with the radio, there are certain things that you become fond of, and you welcome them and resent the new things.
The best tunes they had that winter were "Sing Something Simple," "Singsong Girl," and "Little White Lies.
" No other tunes were as satisfactory, Mr.
Frazer felt.
"Betty Co-ed" was a good tune too, but the parody of the words which came unavoidably into Mr.
Frazer's mind, grew so steadily and increasingly obscene that there being no one to appreciate it, he finally abandoned it and let the song go back to football.
About nine o'clock in the morning they would start using the X-ray machine, and then the radio, which, by then, was only getting Hailey, became useless.
Many people in Hailey who owned radios protested about the hospital's X-ray machine which ruined their morning reception, but there was never any action taken, although many felt it was a shame the hospital could not use their machine at a time when people were not using their radios.
* * * * *.
About the time when it became necessary to turn off the radio Sister Cecilia came in.
"How's Cayetano, Sister Cecilia?" Mr. Frazer asked.
"Oh, he's very bad."
"Is he out of his head?"
"No, but I'm afraid he's going to die."
"How are you?"
"I'm very worried about him, and do you know that absolutely no one has come to see him? He could die just like a dog for all those Mexicans care. They're really dreadful."
"Do you want to come up and hear the game this afternoon?"
"Oh, no," she said. "I'd be too excited. I'll be in the chapel praying."
"We ought to be able to hear it pretty well," Mr. Frazer said. "They're playing out on the coast and the difference in time will bring it late enough so we can get it all right."
"Oh, no. I couldn't do it. The world series nearly finished me. When the Athletics were at bat I was praying right out loud: 'Oh, Lord, direct their batting eyes! Oh, Lord, may he hit one! Oh, Lord, may he hit safely!' Then when they filled the bases in the third game, you remember, it was too much for me. 'Oh, Lord, may he hit it out of the lot! Oh, Lord, may he drive it clean over the fence!' Then you know when the Cardinals would come to bat it was simply dreadful. 'Oh, Lord, may they not see it! Oh, Lord, don't let them even catch a glimpse of it! Oh, Lord, may they fan!' And this game is even worse. It's Notre Dame. Our Lady. No, I'll be in the chapel. For Our Lady. They're playing for Our Lady. I wish you'd write something sometime for Our Lady. You could do it. You know you could do it, Mr. Frazer."
"I don't know anything about her that I could write. It's mostly been written already," Mr. Frazer said. "You wouldn't like the way I write. She wouldn't care for it either."
"You'll write about her sometime," Sister said. "I know you will. You must write about Our Lady."
"You'd better come up and hear the game."
"It would be too much for me. No, I'll be in the chapel doing what I can."
That afternoon they had been playing about five minutes when a probationer came into the room and said, "Sister Cecilia wants to know how the game is going?".
"Tell her they have a touchdown already."
In a little while the probationer came into the room again.
"Tell her they're playing them off their feet," Mr. Frazer said.
A little later he rang the bell for the nurse who was on floor duty.
"Would you mind going down to the chapel or sending word down to Sister Cecilia that Notre Dame has them fourteen to nothing at the end of the first quarter and that it's all right.
She can stop praying.
In a few minutes Sister Cecilia came into the room.
She was very excited.
"What does fourteen to nothing mean? I don't know anything about this game.
That's a nice safe lead in baseball.
But I don't know anything about football.
It may not mean a thing.
I'm going right back down to the chapel and pray until it's finished.
"They have them beaten," Frazer said. "I promise you. Stay and listen with me."
"No. No. No. No. No. No. No," she said. "I'm going right down to the chapel to pray."
Frazer sent down word whenever Notre Dame scored, and finally, when it had been dark a long time, the final result.
"How's Sister Cecilia?"
"They're all at chapel," she said.
The next morning Sister Cecilia came in.
She was very pleased and confident.
"I knew they couldn't beat Our Lady," she said. "They couldn't. Cayetano's better too. He's much better. He's going to have visitors. He can't see them yet, but they are going to come and that will make him feel better and know he's not forgotten by his own people. I went down and saw that O'Brien boy at Police Headquarters and told him that he's got to send some Mexicans up to see poor Cayetano. He's going to send some this afternoon. Then that poor man will feel better. It's wicked the way no one has come to see him."
That afternoon about five o'clock three Mexicans came into the room.
"Can one?" asked the biggest one, who had very thick lips and was quite fat.
"Why not?" Mr. Frazer answered. "Sit down, gentlemen. Will you take something?"
"Many thanks," said the big one.
"Thanks," said the darkest and smallest one.
"Thanks, no," said the thin one. "It mounts to my head." He tapped his head.
The nurse brought some glasses.
"Please give them the bottle," Frazer said.
"It is from Red Lodge," he explained.
"That of Red Lodge is the best," said the big one. "Much better than that of Big Timber."
"Clearly," said the smallest one, "and costs more too."
"In Red Lodge it is of all prices," said the big one.
"How many tubes has the radio?" asked the one who did not drink.
"Seven."
"Very beautiful," he said. "What does it cost?"
"I don't know," Mr. Frazer said. "It is rented."
"You gentlemen are friends of Cayetano?"
"No," said the big one. "We are friends of he who wounded him."
"We were sent here by the police," the smallest one said.
"We have a little place," the big one said. "He and I," indicating the one who did not drink. "He has a little place too," indicating the small, dark one. "The police tell us we have to come--so we come."
"I am very happy you have come."
"Equally," said the big one.
"Will you have another little cup?"
"Why not?" said the big one.
"With your permission," said the smallest one.
"Not me," said the thin one. "It mounts to my head."
"It is very good," said the smallest one.
"Why not try some," Mr. Frazer asked the thin one. "Let a little mount to your head."
"Afterwards comes the headache," said the thin one.
"Could you not send friends of Cayetano to see him?" Frazer asked.
"He has no friends."
"Every man has friends."
"This one, no."
"What does he do?"
"He is a card-player."
"Is he good?"
"I believe it."
"From me," said the smallest one, "he won one hundred and eighty dollars. Now there is no longer one hundred and eighty dollars in the world."
"From me," said the thin one, "he won two hundred and eleven dollars. Fix yourself on that figure."
"I never played with him," said the fat one.
"He must be very rich," Mr. Frazer suggested.
"He is poorer than we," said the little Mexican.
"He has no more than the shirt on his back."
"And that shirt is of little value now," Mr. Frazer said. "Perforated as it is."
"Clearly."
"The one who wounded him was a card-player?"
"No, a beet worker. He has had to leave town."
"Fix yourself on this," said the smallest one. "He was the best guitar player ever in this town. The finest."
"What a shame."
"I believe it," said the biggest one. "How he could touch the guitar."
"There are no good guitar players left?"
"Not the shadow of a guitar player."
"There is an accordion player who is worth something," the thin man said.
"There are a few who touch various instruments," the big one said. "You like music?"
"How would I not?"
"We will come one night with music? You think the sister would allow it? She seems very amiable."
"I am sure she would permit it when Cayetano is able to hear it."
"Is she a little crazy?" asked the thin one.
"Who?"
"That sister?"
"No," Mr. Frazer said. "She is a fine woman of great intelligence and sympathy."
"I distrust all priests, monks, and sisters," said the thin one.
"He had bad experiences when a boy," the smallest one said.
"I was acolyte," the thin one said proudly. "Now I believe in nothing. Neither do I go to mass."
"Why? Does it mount to your head?"
"No," said the thin one. "It is alcohol that mounts to my head. Religion is the opium of the poor."
"I thought mariajuana was the opium of the poor," Frazer said.
"Did you ever smoke opium?" the big one asked.
"No."
"Nor I," he said. "It seems it is very bad. One commences and cannot stop. It is a vice."
"Like religion," said the thin one.
"This one," said the smallest Mexican, "is very strong against religion."
"It is necessary to be very strong against something," Mr. Frazer said politely.
"I respect those who have faith even though they are ignorant," the thin one said.
"Good," said Mr. Frazer.
"What can we bring you?" asked the big Mexican. "Do you lack for anything?"
"I would be glad to buy some beer if there is good beer."
"We will bring beer."
"Another copita before you go?"
"It is very good."
"We are robbing you."
"I can't take it. It goes to my head. Then I have a bad headache and sick at the stomach."
"Good-by, gentlemen."
"Good-by and thanks."
They went out and there was supper and then the radio, turned to be as quiet as possible and still be heard, and the stations finally signing off in this order: Denver, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, and Seattle.
Frazer received no picture of Denver from the radio.
He could see Denver from the Denver Post, and correct the picture from The Rocky Mountain News.
Nor did he ever have any feel of Salt Lake City or Los Angeles from what he heard from those places.
All he felt about Salt Lake City was that it was clean, but dull, and there were too many ballrooms mentioned in too many big hotels for him to see Los Angeles.
He could not feel it for the ballrooms.
But Seattle he came to know very well, the taxicab company with the big white cabs (each cab equipped with radio itself) he rode in every night out to the roadhouse on the Canadian side where he followed the course of parties by the musical selections they phoned for.
He lived in Seattle from two o'clock on, each night, hearing the pieces that all the different people asked for, and it was as real as Minneapolis, where the revellers left their beds each morning to make that trip down to the studio.
Frazer grew very fond of Seattle, Washington.
* * * * *.
The Mexicans came and brought beer but it was not good beer.
Frazer saw them but he did not feel like talking, and when they went he knew they would not come again.
His nerves had become tricky and he disliked seeing people while he was in this condition.
His nerves went bad at the end of five weeks, and while he was pleased they lasted that long yet he resented being forced to make the same experiment when he already knew the answer.
Frazer had been through this all before.
The only thing which was new to him was the radio.
He played it all night long, turned so low he could barely hear it, and he was learning to listen to it without thinking.
* * * * *.
Sister Cecilia came into the room about ten o'clock in the morning on that day and brought the mail.
She was very handsome, and Mr.
Frazer liked to see her and to hear her talk, but the mail, supposedly coming from a different world, was more important.
However, there was nothing in the mail of any interest.
"You look so much better," she said. "You'll be leaving us soon."
"Yes," Mr. Frazer said. "You look very happy this morning."
"Oh, I am. This morning I feel as though I might be a saint."
Frazer was a little taken aback at this.
"Yes," Sister Cecila went on. "That's what I want to be. A saint. Ever since I was a little girl I've wanted to be a saint. When I was a girl I thought if I renounced the world and went into the convent I would be a saint. That was what I wanted to be and that was what I thought I had to do to be one. I expected I would be a saint. I was absolutely sure I would be one. For just a moment I thought I was one. I was so happy and it seemed so simple and easy. When I awoke in the morning I expected I would be a saint, but I wasn't. I've never become one. I want so to be one. All I want is to be a saint. That is all I've ever wanted. And this morning I feel as though I might be one. Oh, I hope I will get to be one."
"You'll be one. Everybody gets what they want. That's what they always tell me."
"I don't know now. When I was a girl it seemed so simple. I knew I would be a saint. Only I believed it took time when I found it did not happen suddenly. Now it seems almost impossible."
"I'd say you had a good chance."
"Do you really think so? No, I don't want just to be encouraged. Don't just encourage me. I want to be a saint. I want so to be a saint."
"Of course you'll be a saint," Mr. Frazer said.
"No, probably I won't be. But, oh, if I could only be a saint! I'd be perfectly happy."
"You're three to one to be a saint."
"No, don't encourage me. But, oh, if I could only be a saint! If I could only be a saint!"
"How's your friend Cayetano?"
"He's going to get well but he's paralyzed. One of the bullets hit the big nerve that goes down through his thigh and that leg is paralyzed. They only found it out when he got well enough so that he could move."
"Maybe the nerve will regenerate."
"I'm praying that it will," Sister Cecilia said. "You ought to see him."
"I don't feel like seeing anybody."
"You know you'd like to see him. They could wheel him in here."
"All right."
* * * * *.
They wheeled him in, thin, his skin transparent, his hair black and needing to be cut, his eyes very laughing, his teeth bad when he smiled.
"Hola, amigo! Que tal?"
"As you see," said Mr. Frazer. "And thou?"
"Alive and with the leg paralyzed."
"Bad," Mr. Frazer said. "But the nerve can regenerate and be as good as new."
"So they tell me."
"What about the pain?"
"Not now. For a while I was crazy with it in the belly. I thought the pain alone would kill me."
Sister Cecilia was observing them happily.
"She tells me you never made a sound," Mr. Frazer said.
"So many people in the ward," the Mexican said deprecatingly. "What class of pain do you have?"
"Big enough. Clearly not as bad as yours. When the nurse goes out I cry an hour, two hours. It rests me. My nerves are bad now."
"You have the radio. If I had a private room and a radio I would be crying and yelling all night long."
"I doubt it."
"Hombre, si. It's very healthy. But you cannot do it with so many people."
"At least," Mr. Frazer said, "the hands are still good. They tell me you make your living with the hands."
"And the head," he said, tapping his forehead. "But the head isn't worth as much."
"Three of your countrymen were here."
"Sent by the police to see me."
"They brought some beer."
"It probably was bad."
"It was bad."
"Tonight, sent by the police, they come to serenade me." He laughed, then tapped his stomach. "I cannot laugh yet. As musicians they are fatal."
"And the one who shot you?"
"Another fool. I won thirty-eight dollars from him at cards. That is not to kill about."
"The three told me you win much money."
"And am poorer than the birds."
"How?"
"I am a poor idealist. I am the victim of illusions." He laughed, then grinned and tapped his stomach. "I am a professional gambler but I like to gamble. To really gamble. Little gambling is all crooked. For real gambling you need luck. I have no luck."
"Never?"
"Never. I am completely without luck. Look, this cabron who shoots me just now. Can he shoot? No. The first shot he fires into nothing. The second is intercepted by a poor Russian. That would seem to be luck. What happens? He shoots me twice in the belly. He is a lucky man. I have no luck. He could not hit a horse if he were holding the stirrup. All luck."
"I thought he shot you first and the Russian after."
"No, the Russian first, me after. The paper was mistaken."
"Why didn't you shoot him?"
"I never carry a gun. With my luck, if I carried a gun I would be hanged ten times a year. I am a cheap card player, only that." He stopped, then continued. "When I make a sum of money I gamble and when I gamble I lose. I have passed at dice for three thousand dollars and crapped out for the six. With good dice. More than once."
"Why continue?"
"If I live long enough the luck will change. I have bad luck now for fifteen years. If I ever get any good luck I will be rich." He grinned. "I am a good gambler, really I would enjoy being rich."
"Do you have bad luck with all games?"
"With everything and with women." He smiled again, showing his bad teeth.
"Truly?"
"Truly."
"And what is there to do?"
"Continue, slowly, and wait for luck to change."
"But with women?"
"No gambler has luck with women. He is too concentrated. He works nights. When he should be with the woman. No man who works nights can hold a woman if the woman is worth anything."
"You are a philosopher."
"No, hombre. A gambler of the small towns. One small town, then another, another, then a big town, then start over again."
"Then shot in the belly."
"The first time," he said. "That has only happened once."
"I tire you talking?" Mr. Frazer suggested.
"No," he said. "I must tire you."
"And the leg?"
"I have no great use for the leg. I am all right with the leg or not. I will be able to circulate."
"I wish you luck, truly, and with all my heart," Mr. Frazer said.
"Equally," he said. "And that the pain stops."
"It will not last, certainly. It is passing. It is of no importance."
"That it passes quickly."
"Equally."
* * * * *.
That night the Mexicans played the accordion and other instruments in the ward and it was cheerful and the noise of the inhalations and exhalations of the accordion, and of the bells, the traps, and the drum came down the corridor.
In that ward there was a rodeo rider who had come out of the chutes on Midnight on a hot dusty afternoon with a big crowd watching, and now, with a broken back, was going to learn to work in leather and to cane chairs when he got well enough to leave the hospital.
There was a carpenter who had fallen with a scaffolding and broken both ankles and both wrists.
He had lit like a cat but without a cat's resiliency.
They could fix him up so that he could work again but it would take a long time.
There was a boy from a farm, about sixteen years old, with a broken leg that had been badly set and was to be rebroken.
There was Cayetano Ruiz, a small-town gambler with a paralyzed leg.
Down the corridor Mr.
Frazer could hear them all laughing and merry with the music made by the Mexicans who had been sent by the police.
The Mexicans were having a good time.
They came in, very excited, to see Mr.
Frazer and wanted to know if there was anything he wanted them to play, and they came twice more to play at night of their own accord.
The last time they played Mr.
Frazer lay in his room with the door open and listened to the noisy, bad music and could not keep from thinking.
When they wanted to know what he wished played, he asked for the Cucaracha, which has the sinister lightness and deftness of so many of the tunes men have gone to die to.
They played noisily and with emotion.
The tune was better than most of such tunes, to Mr.
Frazer's mind, but the effect was all the same.
In spite of this introduction of emotion, Mr.
Frazer went on thinking.
Usually he avoided thinking all he could, except when he was writing, but now he was thinking about those who were playing and what the little one had said.
Religion is the opium of the people.
He believed that, that dyspeptic little joint-keeper.
Yes, and music is the opium of the people.
Old mount-to-the-head hadn't thought of that.
And now economics is the opium of the people; along with patriotism the opium of the people in Italy and Germany.
What about sexual intercourse; was that an opium of the people? Of some of the people.
Of some of the best of the people.
But drink was a sovereign opium of the people, oh, an excellent opium.
Although some prefer the radio, another opium of the people, a cheap one he had just been using.
Along with these went gambling, an opium of the people if there ever was one, one of the oldest.
Ambition was another, an opium of the people, along with a belief in any new form of government.
What you wanted was the minimum of government, always less government.
Liberty, what we believed in, now the name of a MacFadden publication.
We believed in that although they had not found a new name for it yet.
But what was the real one? What was the real, the actual, opium of the people? He knew it very well.
It was gone just a little way around the corner in that well-lighted part of his mind that was there after two or more drinks in the evening; that he knew was there (it was not really there of course).
What was it? He knew very well.
What was it? Of course; bread was the opium of the people.
Would he remember that and would it make sense in the daylight? Bread is the opium of the people.
"Listen," Mr. Frazer said to the nurse when she came. "Get that little thin Mexican in here, will you, please?"
"How did you like it?" the Mexican said at the door.
"Very much."
"It is a historic tune," the Mexican said. "It is the tune of the real revolution."
"Listen," said Mr. Frazer. "Why should the people be operated on without an anæsthetic?"
"I do not understand."
"Why are not all the opiums of the people, good? What do you want to do with the people?"
"They should be rescued from ignorance."
"Don't talk nonsense. Education is an opium of the people. You ought to know that. You've had a little."
"You do not believe in education?"
"No," said Mr. Frazer. "In knowledge, yes."
"I do not follow you."
"Many times I do not follow myself with pleasure."
"You want to hear the Cucaracha another time?" asked the Mexican worriedly.
"Yes," said Mr. Frazer. "Play the Cucaracha another time. It's better than the radio."
Revolution, Mr.
Frazer thought, is no opium.
Revolution is a catharsis; an ecstasy which can only be prolonged by tyranny.
The opiums are for before and for after.
He was thinking well, a little too well.
They would go now in a little while, he thought, and they would take the Cucaracha with them.
Then he would have a little spot of the giant killer and play the radio, you could play the radio so that you could hardly hear it.
FATHERS AND SONS.
There had been a sign to detour in the centre of the main street of this town, but cars had obviously gone through, so, believing it was some repair which had been completed, Nicholas Adams drove on through the town along the empty, brick-paved street, stopped by traffic lights that flashed on and off on this traffic-less Sunday, and would be gone next year when the payments on the system were not met; on under the heavy trees of the small town that are a part of your heart if it is your town and you have walked under them, but that are only too heavy, that shut out the sun and that dampen the houses for a stranger; out past the last house and onto the highway that rose and fell straight away ahead with banks of red dirt sliced cleanly away and the second-growth timber on both sides.
It was not his country but it was the middle of fall and all of this country was good to drive through and to see.
The cotton was picked and in the clearings there were patches of corn, some cut with streaks of red sorghum, and, driving easily, his son asleep on the seat by his side, the day's run made, knowing the town he would reach for the night, Nick noticed which corn fields had soy beans or peas in them, how the thickets and the cut-over land lay, where the cabins and houses were in relation to the fields and the thickets; hunting the country in his mind as he went by; sizing up each clearing as to feed and cover and figuring where you would find a covey and which way they would fly.
In shooting quail you must not get between them and their habitual cover, once the dogs have found them, or when they flush they will come pouring at you, some rising steep, some skimming by your ears, whirring into a size you have never seen them in the air as they pass, the only way being to turn and take them over your shoulder as they go, before they set their wings and angle down into the thicket.
Hunting this country for quail as his father had taught him, Nicholas Adams started thinking about his father.
When he first thought about him it was always the eyes.
The big frame, the quick movements, the wide shoulders, the hooked, hawk nose, the beard that covered the weak chin, you never thought about--it was always the eyes.
They were protected in his head by the formation of the brows; set deep as though a special protection had been devised for some very valuable instrument.
They saw much farther and much quicker than the human eye sees and they were the great gift his father had.
His father saw as a big-horn ram or as an eagle sees, literally.
He would be standing with his father on one shore of the lake, his own eyes were very good then, and his father would say, "They've run up the flag.
" Nick could not see the flag or the flag pole.
"There," his father would say, "it's your sister Dorothy.
She's got the flag up and she's walking out onto the dock.
Nick would look across the lake and he could see the long wooded shore-line, the higher timber behind, the point that guarded the bay, the clear hills of the farm and the white of their cottage in the trees but he could not see any flag pole, or any dock, only the white of the beach and the curve of the shore.
"Can you see the sheep on the hillside toward the point?"
"Yes."
They were a whitish patch on the gray-green of the hill.
"I can count them," his father said.
Like all men with a faculty that surpasses human requirements, his father was very nervous.
Then, too, he was sentimental, and, like most sentimental people, he was both cruel and abused.
Also, he had much bad luck, and it was not all of it his own.
He had died in a trap that he had helped only a little to set, and they had all betrayed him in their various ways before he died.
All sentimental people are betrayed so many times.
Nick could not write about him yet, although he would, later, but the quail country made him remember him as he was when Nick was a boy and he was very grateful to him for two things; fishing and shooting.
His father was as sound on those two things as he was unsound on sex, for instance, and Nick was glad that it had been that way; for some one has to give you your first gun or the opportunity to get it and use it, and you have to live where there is game or fish if you are to learn about them, and now, at thirty-eight, he loved to fish and to shoot exactly as much as when he first had gone with his father.
It was a passion that had never slackened and he was very grateful to his father for bringing him to know it.
While for the other, that his father was not sound about, all the equipment you will ever have is provided and each man learns all there is for him to know about it without advice; and it makes no difference where you live.
He remembered very clearly the only two pieces of information his father had given him about that.
Once when they were out shooting together Nick shot a red squirrel out of a hemlock tree.
The squirrel fell, wounded, and when Nick picked him up bit the boy clean through the ball of the thumb.
"The dirty little bugger," Nick said and smacked the squirrel's head against the tree. "Look how he bit me."
His father looked and said, "Suck it out clean and put some iodine on when you get home.
"The little bugger," Nick said.
"Do you know what a bugger is?" his father asked him.
"We call anything a bugger," Nick said.
"A bugger is a man who has intercourse with animals."
"Why?" Nick said.
"I don't know," his father said. "But it is a heinous crime."
Nick's imagination was both stirred and horrified by this and he thought of various animals but none seemed attractive or practical and that was the sum total of direct sexual knowledge bequeathed him by his father except on one other subject.
One morning he read in the paper that Enrico Caruso had been arrested for mashing.
"What is mashing?"
"It is one of the most heinous of crimes," his father answered. Nick's imagination pictured the great tenor doing something strange, bizarre, and heinous with a potato masher to a beautiful lady who looked like the pictures of Anna Held on the inside of cigar boxes. He resolved, with considerable horror, that when he was old enough he would try mashing at least once.
His father had summed up the whole matter by stating that masturbation produced blindness, insanity, and death, while a man who went with prostitutes would contract hideous venereal diseases and that the thing to do was to keep your hands off of people.
On the other hand his father had the finest pair of eyes he had ever seen and Nick had loved him very much and for a long time.
Now, knowing how it had all been, even remembering the earliest times before things had gone badly was not good remembering.
If he wrote it he could get rid of it.
He had gotten rid of many things by writing them.
But it was still too early for that.
There were still too many people.
So he decided to think of something else.
There was nothing to do about his father and he had thought it all through many times.
The handsome job the undertaker had done on his father's face had not blurred in his mind and all the rest of it was quite clear, including the responsibilities.
He had complimented the undertaker.
The undertaker had been both proud and smugly pleased.
But it was not the undertaker that had given him that last face.
The undertaker had only made certain dashingly executed repairs of doubtful artistic merit.
The face had been making itself and being made for a long time.
It had modelled fast in the last three years.
It was a good story but there were still too many people alive for him to write it.
Nick's own education in those earlier matters had been acquired in the hemlock woods behind the Indian camp.
This was reached by a trail which ran from the cottage through the woods to the farm and then by a road which wound through the slashings to the camp.
Now he could still feel all of that trail with bare feet.
First there was the pine needle loam through the hemlock woods behind the cottage where the fallen logs crumbled into wood dust and long splintered pieces of wood hung like javelins in the tree that had been struck by lightning.
You crossed the creek on a log and if you stepped off there was the black muck of the swamp.
You climbed a fence out of the woods and the trail was hard in the sun across the field with cropped grass and sheep sorrel and mullen growing and to the left the quaky bog of the creek bottom where the killdeer plover fed.
The spring house was in that creek.
Below the barn there was fresh warm manure and the other older manure that was caked dry on top.
Then there was another fence and the hard, hot trail from the barn to the house and the hot sandy road that ran down to the woods, crossing the creek, on a bridge this time, where the cat-tails grew that you soaked in kerosene to make jack-lights with for spearing fish at night.
Then the main road went off to the left, skirting the woods and climbing the hill, while you went into the woods on the wide clay and shale road, cool under the trees, and broadened for them to skid out the hemlock bark the Indians cut.
The hemlock bark was piled in long rows of stacks, roofed over with more bark, like houses, and the peeled logs lay huge and yellow where the trees had been felled.
They left the logs in the woods to rot, they did not even clear away or burn the tops.
It was only the bark they wanted for the tannery at Boyne City; hauling it across the lake on the ice in winter, and each year there was less forest and more open, hot, shadeless, weed-grown slashing.
But there was still much forest then, virgin forest where the trees grew high before there were any branches and you walked on the brown, clean, springy-needled ground with no undergrowth and it was cool on the hottest days and they three lay against the trunk of a hemlock wider than two beds are long, with the breeze high in the tops and the cool light that came in patches, and Billy said:.
"You want Trudy again?"
"You want to?"
"Un Huh."
"Come on."
"No, here."
"But Billy----"
"I no mind Billy. He my brother."
* * * * *.
Then afterwards they sat, the three of them, listening for a black squirrel that was in the top branches where they could not see him.
They were waiting for him to bark again because when he barked he would jerk his tail and Nick would shoot where he saw any movement.
His father gave him only three cartridges a day to hunt with and he had a single-barrel twenty-gauge shotgun with a very long barrel.
"Son of a bitch never move," Billy said.
"You shoot, Nickie. Scare him. We see him jump. Shoot him again," Trudy said. It was a long speech for her.
"I've only got two shells," Nick said.
"Son of a bitch," said Billy.
They sat against the tree and were quiet.
Nick was feeling hollow and happy.
"Eddie says he going to come some night sleep in bed with you sister Dorothy."
"What?"
"He said."
Trudy nodded.
"That's all he want do," she said. Eddie was their older half-brother. He was seventeen.
"If Eddie Gilby ever comes at night and even speaks to Dorothy you know what I'd do to him? I'd kill him like this." Nick cocked the gun and hardly taking aim pulled the trigger, blowing a hole as big as your hand in the head or belly of that half-breed bastard Eddie Gilby. "Like that. I'd kill him like that."
"He better not come then," Trudy said. She put her hand in Nick's pocket.
"He better watch out plenty," said Billy.
"He's big bluff," Trudy was exploring with her hand in Nick's pocket. "But don't you kill him. You get plenty trouble."
"I'd kill him like that," Nick said. Eddie Gilby lay on the ground with all his chest shot away. Nick put his foot on him proudly.
"I'd scalp him," he said happily.
"No," said Trudy. "That's dirty."
"I'd scalp him and send it to his mother."
"His mother dead," Trudy said. "Don't you kill him, Nickie. Don't you kill him for me."
"After I scalped him I'd throw him to the dogs."
Billy was very depressed.
"He better watch out," he said gloomily.
"They'd tear him to pieces," Nick said, pleased with the picture. Then, having scalped that half-breed renegade and standing, watching the dogs tear him, his face unchanging, he fell backward against the tree, held tight around the neck, Trudy holding, choking him, and crying, "No kill him! No kill him! No kill him! No. No. No. Nickie. Nickie. Nickie!"
"What's the matter with you?"
"No kill him."
"I got to kill him."
"He just a big bluff."
"All right," Nickie said. "I won't kill him unless he comes around the house. Let go of me."
"That's good," Trudy said. "You want to do anything now? I feel good now."
"If Billy goes away." Nick had killed Eddie Gilby, then pardoned him his life, and he was a man now.
"You go, Billy. You hang around all the time. Go on."
"Son a bitch," Billy said. "I get tired this. What we come? Hunt or what?"
"You can take the gun. There's one shell."
"All right. I get a big black one all right."
"I'll holler," Nick said.
* * * * *.
Then, later, it was a long time after and Billy was still away.
"You think we make a baby?" Trudy folded her brown legs together happily and rubbed against him. Something inside Nick had gone a long way away.
"I don't think so," he said.
"Make plenty baby what the hell."
They heard Billy shoot.
"I wonder if he got one."
"Don't care," said Trudy.
Billy came through the trees.
He had the gun over his shoulder and he held a black squirrel by the front paws.
"Look," he said. "Bigger than a cat. You all through?"
"Where'd you get him?"
"Over there. Saw him jump first."
"Got to go home," Nick said.
"No," said Trudy.
"I got to get there for supper."
"All right."
"Want to hunt tomorrow?"
"All right."
"You can have the squirrel."
"All right."
"Come out after supper?"
"No."
"How you feel?"
"Good."
"All right."
"Give me kiss on the face," said Trudy.
Now, as he rode along the highway in the car and it was getting dark, Nick was all through thinking about his father.
The end of the day never made him think of him.
The end of the day had always belonged to Nick alone and he never felt right unless he was alone at it.
His father came back to him in the fall of the year, or in the early spring when there had been jack-snipe on the prairie, or when he saw shocks of corn, or when he saw a lake, or if he ever saw a horse and buggy, or when he saw, or heard, wild geese, or in a duck blind; remembering the time an eagle dropped through the whirling snow to strike a canvas-covered decoy, rising, his wings beating, the talons caught in the canvas.
His father was with him, suddenly, in deserted orchards and in new-plowed fields, in thickets, on small hills, or when going through dead grass, whenever splitting wood or hauling water, by grist mills, cider mills and dams and always with open fires.
The towns he lived in were not towns his father knew.
After he was fifteen he had shared nothing with him.
His father had frost in his beard in cold weather and in hot weather he sweated very much.
He liked to work in the sun on the farm because he did not have to and he loved manual work, which Nick did not.
Nick loved his father but hated the smell of him and once when he had to wear a suit of his father's underwear that had gotten too small for his father it made him feel sick and he took it off and put it under two stones in the creek and said that he had lost it.
He had told his father how it was when his father had made him put it on but his father had said it was freshly washed.
It had been, too.
When Nick had asked him to smell of it his father sniffed at it indignantly and said that it was clean and fresh.
When Nick came home from fishing without it and said he lost it he was whipped for lying.
Afterwards he had sat inside the woodshed with the door open, his shotgun loaded and cocked, looking across at his father sitting on the screen porch reading the paper, and thought, "I can blow him to hell.
I can kill him.
" Finally he felt his anger go out of him and he felt a little sick about it being the gun that his father had given him.
Then he had gone to the Indian camp, walking there in the dark, to get rid of the smell.
There was only one person in his family that he liked the smell of; one sister.
All the others he avoided all contact with.
That sense blunted when he started to smoke.
It was a good thing.
It was good for a bird dog but it did not help a man.
"What was it like, Papa, when you were a little boy and used to hunt with the Indians?"
"I don't know," Nick was startled. He had not even noticed the boy was awake. He looked at him sitting beside him on the seat. He had felt quite alone but this boy had been with him. He wondered for how long. "We used to go all day to hunt black squirrels," he said. "My father only gave me three shells a day because he said that would teach me to hunt and it wasn't good for a boy to go banging around. I went with a boy named Billy Gilby and his sister Trudy. We used to go out nearly every day all one summer."
"Those are funny names for Indians."
"Yes, aren't they," Nick said.
"But tell me what they were like."
"They were Ojibways," Nick said. "And they were very nice."
"But what were they like to be with?"
"It's hard to say," Nick Adams said. Could you say she did first what no one has ever done better and mention plump brown legs, flat belly, hard little breasts, well holding arms, quick searching tongue, the flat eyes, the good taste of mouth, then uncomfortably, tightly, sweetly, moistly, lovely, tightly, achingly, fully, finally, unendingly, never-endingly, never-to-endingly, suddenly ended, the great bird flown like an owl in the twilight, only it daylight in the woods and hemlock needles stuck against your belly. So that when you go in a place where Indians have lived you smell them gone and all the empty pain killer bottles and the flies that buzz do not kill the sweetgrass smell, the smoke smell and that other like a fresh cased marten skin. Nor any jokes about them nor old squaws take that away. Nor the sick sweet smell they get to have. Nor what they did finally. It wasn't how they ended. They all ended the same. Long time ago good. Now no good.
And about the other.
When you have shot one bird flying you have shot all birds flying.
They are all different and they fly in different ways but the sensation is the same and the last one is as good as the first.
He could thank his father for that.
"You might not like them," Nick said to the boy. "But I think you would."
"And my grandfather lived with them too when he was a boy, didn't he?"
"Yes. When I asked him what they were like he said that he had many friends among them."
"Will I ever live with them?"
"I don't know," Nick said. "That's up to you."
"How old will I be when I get a shotgun and can hunt by myself."
"Twelve years old if I see you are careful."
"I wish I was twelve now."
"You will be, soon enough."
"What was my grandfather like? I can't remember him except that he gave me an air rifle and an American flag when I came over from France that time. What was he like?"
"He's hard to describe. He was a great hunter and fisherman and he had wonderful eyes."
"Was he greater than you?"
"He was a much better shot and his father was a great wing shot too."
"I'll bet he wasn't better than you."
"Oh, yes he was. He shot very quickly and beautifully. I'd rather see him shoot than any man I ever knew. He was always very disappointed in the way I shot."
"Why do we never go to pray at the tomb of my grandfather?"
"We live in a different part of the country. It's a long way from here."
"In France that wouldn't make any difference. In France we'd go. I think I ought to go to pray at the tomb of my grandfather."
"Sometime we'll go."
"I hope we won't live somewhere so that I can never go to pray at your tomb when you are dead."
"We'll have to arrange it."
"Don't you think we might all be buried at a convenient place? We could all be buried in France. That would be fine."
"I don't want to be buried in France," Nick said.
"Well, then, we'll have to get some convenient place in America. Couldn't we all be buried out at the ranch?"
"That's an idea."
"Then I could stop and pray at the tomb of my grandfather on the way to the ranch."
"You're awfully practical."
"Well, I don't feel good never to have even visited the tomb of my grandfather."
"We'll have to go," Nick said. "I can see we'll have to go."
Chapter I.
They started two hours before daylight, and at first, it was not necessary to break the ice across the canal as other boats had gone on ahead.
In each boat, in the darkness, so you could not see, but only hear him, the poler stood in the stern, with his long oar.
The shooter sat on a shooting stool fastened to the top of a box that contained his lunch and shells, and the shooter's two, or more, guns were propped against the load of wooden decoys.
Somewhere, in each boat, there was a sack with one or two live mallard hens, or a hen and a drake, and in each boat there was a dog who shifted and shivered uneasily at the sound of the wings of the ducks that passed overhead in the darkness.
Four of the boats went on up the main canal towards the big lagoon to the north.
A fifth boat had already turned off into a side canal.
Now, the sixth boat turned south into a shallow lagoon, and there was no broken water.
It was all ice, new-frozen during the sudden, windless cold of the night.
It was rubbery and bending against the thrust of the boatman's oar.
Then it would break as sharply as a pane of glass, but the boat made little forward progress.
'Give me an oar,' the shooter in the sixth boat said.
He stood up and braced himself carefully.
He could hear the ducks passing in the darkness, and feel the restless lurching of the dog.
To the north he heard the sound of breaking ice from the other boats.
'Be careful,' the poler in the stern said.
'Don't tip the boat over.
'I am a boatman, too,' the shooter said.
He took the long oar the boatman handed him and reversed it so he could hold it by the blade.
Holding the blade he reached forward and punched the handle through the ice.
He felt the firm bottom of the shallow lagoon, put his weight on the top of the wide oar-blade, and holding with both hands and, first pulling, then shoving, until the pole-hold was well to the stern, he drove the boat ahead to break the ice.
The ice broke like sheets of plate glass as the boat drove into it, and onto it, and astern the boatman shoved them ahead into the broken passage.
After a while, the shooter, who was working hard and steadily and sweating in his heavy clothes, asked the boatman, 'Where is the shooting barrel?'.
'Off there to the left.
In the middle of the next bay.
'Should I turn for it now?'.
'As you wish.
'What do you mean, as I wish? You know the water.
Is there water to carry us there?'.
'The tide is low.
Who knows?'.
'It will be daylight before we get there if we don't hurry.
The boatman did not answer.
All right, you surly jerk, the shooter thought to himself.
We are going to get there.
We've made two-thirds of the way now and if you are worried about having to work to break ice to pick up birds, that is altogether too bad.
'Get your back in it, jerk,' he said in English.
'What?' the boatman asked in Italian.
'I said let's go.
It's going to be light.
It was daylight before they reached the oaken-staved hogshead sunk in the bottom of the lagoon.
It was surrounded by a sloping rim of earth that had been planted with sedge and grass, and the shooter swung carefully up onto this, feeling the frozen grasses break as he stepped on them.
The boatman lifted the combination shooting stool and shell box out of the boat and handed it to the shooter, who leaned over and placed it in the bottom of the big barrel.
The shooter, wearing his hip boots and an old combat jacket, with a patch on the left shoulder that no one understood, and with the slight light places on the straps, where stars had been removed, climbed down into the barrel and the boatman handed him his two guns.
He placed them against the wall of the barrel and hung his other shell bag between them, hanging it on two hooks built into the wall of the sunken barrel.
Then he leaned the guns against each side of the shell bag.
'Is there water?' he asked the boatman.
'No water,' the boatman said.
'Can you drink the lagoon water?'.
'No.
It is unhealthy.
The shooter was thirsty from the hard work of breaking the ice and driving the boat in and he felt his anger rise, and then held it, and said, 'Can I help you in the boat to break ice to put out the decoys?'.
'No,' the boatman said and shoved the boat savagely out on to the thin sheet ice that cracked and ripped as the boat drove up on to it.
The boatman commenced smashing at the ice with the blade of his oar and then started tossing decoys out to the side and behind him.
He's in a beautiful mood, the shooter thought.
He's a big brute, too.
I worked like a horse coming out here.
He just pulled his weight and that's all.
What the hell is eating him? This is his trade, isn't it?.
He arranged the shooting stool so he would have the maximum swing to left and right, opened a box of shells, and filled his pockets and opened another of the boxes of shells in the shell bag so he could reach into it easily.
In front of him, where the lagoon lay glazed in the first light, was the black boat and the tall, heavily built boatman smashing with his oar at the ice and tossing decoys overboard as though he were ridding himself of something obscene.
It was getting lighter now and the shooter could see the low line of the near point across the lagoon.
Beyond that point he knew there were two other shooting posts and far beyond it there was more marsh and then the open sea.
He loaded both his guns and checked the position of the boat that was putting out decoys.
From behind him, he heard the incoming whisper of wings and he crouched, took hold of his right-hand gun with his right hand as he looked up from under the rim of the barrel, then stood to shoot at the two ducks that were dropping down, their wings set to brake, coming down dark to the grey dim sky, slanting towards the decoys.
His head low, he swung the gun on a long slant, down, well and ahead of the second duck, then without looking at the result of his shot he raised the gun smoothly, up, up ahead and to the left of the other duck that was climbing to the left and as he pulled, saw it fold in flight and drop among the decoys in the broken ice.
He looked to his right and saw the first duck a black patch on the same ice.
He knew he had shot carefully on the first duck, far to the right of where the boat was and on the second, high out and to the left, letting the duck climb far up and to the left to be sure the boat was out of any line of fire.
It was a lovely double, shot exactly as he should have shot, with complete consideration and respect for the position of the boat and he felt very good as he reloaded.
'Listen,' the man in the boat called.
'Don't shoot towards the boat.
I'll be a sad son of a bitch, the shooter said to himself.
I will indeed.
'Get your decoys out,' he called to the man in the boat.
'But get them out fast.
I won't shoot until they are all out.
Except straight overhead.
The man in the boat said nothing that could be heard.
I can't figure it, the shooter thought to himself.
He knows the game.
He knows I split the work, or more, coming out.
I never shot a safer or more careful duck in my life than that.
What's the matter with him? I offered to put the dekes out with him.
The hell with him.
Out on the right now, the boatman was still chopping angrily at the ice and tossing out the wooden decoys in a hatred that showed in every move he made.
Don't let him spoil it, the shooter told himself.
There won't be much shooting with this ice unless the sun should melt it later on, You probably will only have a few birds, so don't let him spoil it for you.
You don't know how many more times you will shoot ducks and do not let anything spoil it for you.
He watched the sky lightening beyond the long point of marsh and turning in the sunken barrel, he looked out across the frozen lagoon and the marsh and saw the snow-covered mountains a long way off.
Low as he was, no foot-hills showed and the mountains rose abruptly from the plain.
As he looked towards the mountains he could feel a breeze on his face and he knew, then, the wind would come from there, rising with the sun and that some birds would surely come flying in from the sea when the wind disturbed them.
The boatman had finished putting out the decoys.
They were in two bunches, one straight ahead and to the left towards where the sun would rise and the other to the shooter's right.
Now he dropped over the hen mallard with her string and anchor and the calling duck bobbed her head under water and raising and dipping her head, splashed water on to her back.
'Don't you think it would be good to break more ice around the edges?' the shooter called to the boatman.
'There's not much water to attract them.
The boatman said nothing but commenced to smash at the jagged perimeter of ice with his oar.
This ice breaking was unnecessary and the boatman knew it.
But the shooter did not know it and he thought, I do not understand him but I must not let him ruin it.
I must keep it entire and not let him do it.
Every time you shoot now can be the last shoot and no stupid son of a bitch should be allowed to ruin it.
Keep your temper, boy, he told himself.
Chapter II.
But he was not a boy.
He was fifty and a Colonel of Infantry in the Army of the United States and to pass a physical examination that he had to take the day before he came down to Venice for this shoot, he had taken enough mannitol hexanitrate to, well he did not quite know what to—to pass, he said to himself.
The surgeon had been quite sceptical.
But he noted the readings after taking them twice.
'You know, Dick,' he said.
'It isn't indicated; in fact it is definitely contra-indicated in increased intra-colour and intra-cranial pressure.
'I don't know what you are talking about,' the shooter, who was not a shooter, then, except potentially and was a Colonel of Infantry in the Army of the United States, reduced from being a general officer, said.
'I have known you a long time, Colonel.
Or maybe it just seems a long time,' the surgeon told him.
'It's been a long time,' the Colonel said.
'We sound like song writers,' the surgeon said.
'But don't you ever run into anything, or let any sparks strike you, when you're really souped up on nitroglycerin.
They ought to make you drag a chain like a high-octane truck.
'Wasn't my cardiograph O.
?' the Colonel asked.
'Your cardiograph was wonderful, Colonel.
It could have been that of a man of twenty-five.
It might have been that of a boy of nineteen.
'Then what are you talking about?' the Colonel asked.
That much mannitol hexanitrate produced a certain amount of nausea, sometimes, and he was anxious for the interview to terminate.
He was also anxious to lie down and take a seconal.
I ought to write the manual of minor tactics for the heavy pressure platoon, he thought.
Wish I could tell him that.
Why don't I just throw myself on the mercy of the court? You never do, he told himself.
You always plead them non-guilty.
'How many times have you been hit in the head?' the surgeon asked him.
'You know,' the Colonel told him.
'It's in my 201.
'How many times have you been hit on the head?'.
'Oh Christ.
' Then he said.
'You are asking for the army or as my physician?'.
'As your physician.
You didn't think I'd try to wind your clock, did you?'.
'No, Wes.
I'm sorry.
Just what was it you wanted to know?'.
'Concussions.
'Real ones?'.
'Any time you were cold or couldn't remember afterwards.
'Maybe ten,' the Colonel said.
'Counting polo.
Give or take three.
'You poor old son of a bitch,' the surgeon said.
'Colonel, sir,' he added.
'Can I go now?' the Colonel asked.
'Yes, sir,' the surgeon said.
'You're in good shape.
'Thanks,' the Colonel said.
'Want to go on a duck shoot down in the marshes at the mouth of the Tagliamento? Wonderful shoot.
Some nice Italian kids I met up at Cortina own it.
'Is that where they shoot coots?'.
'No.
They shoot real ducks at this one.
Good kids.
Good shoot.
Real ducks.
Mallard, pin-tail, widgeon.
Some geese.
Just as good as at home when we were kids.
'I was kids in 'twenty-nine and 'thirty.
'That's the first mean thing I ever heard you say.
'I didn't mean it like that.
I just meant I didn't remember when duck shooting was good.
I'm a city boy, too.
'That's the only God-damn trouble with you, too.
I never saw a city boy yet that was worth a damn.
'You don't mean that, do you, Colonel?'.
'Of course not.
You know damn well I don't.
'You're in good shape, Colonel,' the surgeon said.
'I'm sorry I can't go on the shoot.
I can't even shoot.
'Hell,' said the Colonel.
'That doesn't make any difference.
Neither can anybody else in this army.
I'd like to have you around.
'I'll give you something else to back up what you're using.
'Is there anything?'.
'Not really.
They're working on stuff, though.
'Let 'em work,' the Colonel said.
'I think that's a laudable attitude, sir.
'Go to hell,' the Colonel said.
'You sure you don't want to go?'.
'I get my ducks at Longchamps on Madison Avenue,' the surgeon said.
'It's air-conditioned in the summer and it's warm in the winter and I don't have to get up before first light and wear long-horned underwear.
'All right, City Boy.
You'll never know.
'I never wanted to know,' the surgeon said.
'You're in good shape, Colonel, sir.
'Thanks,' said the Colonel and went out.
Chapter III.
That was the day before yesterday.
Yesterday he had driven down from Trieste to Venice along the old road that ran from Montfalcone to Latisana and across the flat country.
He had a good driver and he relaxed completely in the front seat of the car and looked out at all this country he had known when he was a boy.
It looks quite differently now, he thought.
I suppose it is because the distances are all changed.
Everything is much smaller when you are older.
Then, too, the roads are better now and there is no dust.
The only times I used to ride through it was in a camion.
The rest of the times we walked.
I suppose what I looked for then, was patches of shade when we fell out, and wells in farmyards.
And ditches, too, he thought.
I certainly looked for plenty of ditches.
They made a curve and crossed the Tagliamento on a temporary bridge.
It was green along the banks and men were fishing along the far shore where it ran deep.
The blown bridge was being repaired with a snarl of riveting hammers, and eight hundred yards away the smashed buildings and outbuildings of what was now a ruined country house once built by Longhena showed where the mediums had dropped their loads.
'Look at it,' the driver said.
'In this country you find a bridge or a railway station.
Then go half a mile from it in any direction and you find it like that.
'I guess the lesson is,' the Colonel said, 'don't ever build yourself a country house, or a church, or hire Giotto to paint you any frescoes, if you've got a church, eight hundred yards away from any bridge.
'I knew there must be a lesson in it, sir,' the driver said.
They were past the ruined villa now and on to the straight road with the willows growing by the ditches still dark with winter, and the fields full of mulberry trees.
Ahead a man was pedalling a bicycle and using both his hands to read a paper.
'If there are heavies the lesson ought to say a mile,' the driver said.
'Would that be about right, sir?'.
'If it's guided missiles,' the Colonel said.
'Better make it two hundred and fifty miles.
Better give that cyclist some horn.
The driver did, and the man moved over to the side of the road without either looking up or touching his handlebars.
As they passed him, the Colonel tried to see what paper he was reading, but it was folded over.
'I guess a man would do better now not to build himself a fine house or a church, or to get who did you say it was to paint frescoes?'.
'Giotto, I said.
But it could be Piero della Francesca or Mantegna.
Could be Michelangelo.
'Do you know a lot about painters, sir?' the driver asked.
They were on a straight stretch of road now and were making time so that one farm blended, almost blurred, into another farm and you could only see what was far ahead and moving towards you.
Lateral vision was just a condensation of flat, low country in the winter.
I'm not sure I like speed, the Colonel thought.
Brueghel would have been in a hell of a shape if he had to look at the country like this.
'Painters?' he answered the driver.
'I know quite a little about them, Burnham.
'I'm Jackson, sir.
Burnham's up at the rest centre at Cortina.
That's a fine place, sir.
'I'm getting stupid,' the Colonel said.
'Excuse me, Jackson.
It is a fine place.
Good chow.
Well run.
Nobody bothers you.
'Yes, sir,' Jackson agreed.
'Now the reason I asked you about painters, is these madonnas.
I thought I ought to see some painting so I went to that big place in Florence.
'The Uffizi? The Pitti?'.
'Whatever they call it.
The biggest one.
And I kept looking at those paintings until madonnas started to run out of my ears.
I tell you, Colonel, sir, a man who hasn't been checked out on this painting can only see just about so many madonnas and it gets him.
You know my theory? You know how crazy they are about bambinis and the less they got to eat the more bambinis they got and that they have coming? Well, I think these painters were probably big bambini lovers like all Italians.
I don't know these ones you mentioned just now, so I don't include them in my theory and you'll put me straight anyway.
But it looks to me like these madonnas, that I really saw plenty of, sir, it looks to me like these just straight ordinary madonna painters were sort of a manifest, say, of this whole bambini business, if you understand what I mean.
'Plus the fact that they were restricted to religious subjects.
'Yes, sir.
Then you think there is something to my theory?'.
'Sure.
I think it is a little more complicated, though.
'Naturally, sir.
It's just my preliminary theory.
'Do you have any other theories on art, Jackson?'.
'No, sir.
That bambini theory is as far as I've thought it through.
What I wish is, though, they would paint some good pictures of that high country up around the rest centre at Cortina.
'Titian came from up there,' the Colonel said.
'At least they say he did.
I went down the valley and saw the house where he was supposed to be born.
'Was it much of a place, sir?'.
'Not so much.
'Well, if he painted any pictures of that country up around there, with those sunset colour rocks and the pines and the snow and all the pointed steeples——'.
'Campaniles,' the Colonel said.
'Like that one ahead at Ceggia.
It means bell tower.
'Well, if he painted any really good pictures of that country I'd sure as hell like to trade him out of some of them.
'He painted some wonderful women,' the Colonel said.
'If I had a joint or a roadhouse or some sort of an inn, say, I could use one of those,' the driver said.
'But if I brought home a picture of some woman, my old woman would run me from Rawlins to Buffalo.
I'd be lucky if I got to Buffalo.
'You could give it to the local museum.
'All they got in the local museum is arrow heads, war bonnets, scalping knives, different scalps, petrified fish, pipes of peace, photographs of Liver Eating Johnston, and the skin of some bad man that they hanged him and some doctor skinned him out.
One of those women pictures would be out of place there.
'See that next campanile down there across the plain?' the Colonel said.
'I'll show you a place down there where we used to fight when I was a kid.
'Did you fight here, too, sir?'.
'Yeah,' the Colonel said.
'Who had Trieste in that war?'.
'The Krauts.
The Austrians, I mean.
'Did we ever get it?'.
'Not till the end when it was over.
'Who had Florence and Rome?'.
'We did.
'Well, I guess you weren't so damned bad off then.
'Sir,' the Colonel said gently.
'I'm sorry, sir,' the driver said quickly.
'I was in the Thirty-Sixth Division, sir.
'I've seen the patch.
'I was thinking about the Rapido, sir, I didn't mean to be insolent or lacking in respect.
'You weren't,' the Colonel said.
'You were just thinking about the Rapido.
Listen, Jackson, everybody who's soldiered a long time has had their Rapidos and more than one.
'I couldn't take more than one, sir.
The car went through the cheerful town of San Dona di Piave.
It was built up and new, but no more ugly than a middle western town, and it was as prosperous and as cheery as Fossalta, just up the river, is miserable and gloomy, the Colonel thought.
Did Fossalta never get over the first war? I never saw it before it was smacked, he thought.
They shelled it badly before the big fifteenth of June offensive in 'eighteen.
Then we shelled it really badly before we re-took it.
He remembered how the attack had taken off from Monastier, gone through Fornace, and on this winter day he remembered how it had been that summer.
A few weeks ago he had gone through Fossalta and had gone out along the sunken road to find the place where he had been hit, out on the river bank.
It was easy to find because of the bend of the river, and where the heavy machine gun post had been the crater was smoothly grassed.
It had been cropped, by sheep or goats, until it looked like a designed depression in a golf course.
The river was slow and a muddy blue here, with reeds along the edges, and the Colonel, no one being in sight, squatted low, and looking across the river from the bank where you could never show your head in daylight, relieved himself in the exact place where he had determined, by triangulation, that he had been badly wounded thirty years before.
'A poor effort,' he said aloud to the river and the river bank that were heavy with autumn quiet and wet from the fall rains.
'But my own.
He stood up and looked around.
There was no one in sight and he had left the car down the sunken road in front of the last and saddest rebuilt house in Fossalta.
'Now I'll complete the monument,' he said to no one but the dead, and he took an old Solingen clasp knife, such as German poachers carry, from his pocket.
It locked on opening and, twirling it, he dug a neat hole in the moist earth.
He cleaned the knife on his right combat boot and then inserted a brown ten thousand lira note in the hole and tamped it down and put the grass that he had cored out over it.
'That is twenty years at five hundred lira a year for the Medaglia d'Argento al Valore Militare.
The V.
carries ten guineas, I believe.
The D.
is non-productive.
The Silver Star is free.
I'll keep the change,' he said.
It's fine now, he thought.
It has merde, money, blood; look how that grass grows; and the iron's in the earth along with Gino's leg, both of Randolfo's legs and my right knee-cap.
It's a wonderful monument.
It has everything.
Fertility, money, blood and iron.
Sounds like a nation.
Where fertility, money, blood and iron is; there is the fatherland.
We need coal though.
We ought to get some coal.
Then he looked across the river to the rebuilt white house that had once been rubble, and he spat in the river.
It was a long spit and he just made it.
'I couldn't spit that night nor afterwards for a long time,' he said.
'But I spit good now for a man who doesn't chew.
He walked slowly back to where the car was parked.
The driver was asleep.
'Wake up, son,' he had said.
'Turn her around and take that road towards Treviso.
We don't need a map on this part.
I'll give you the turns.
Chapter IV.
Now, on his way into Venice, keeping strictly controlled and unthinking his great need to be there, the big Buick cleared the last of San Dona and came up on to the bridge over the Piave.
They crossed the bridge and were on the Italian side of the river and he saw the old sunken road again.
It was as smooth and undistinguished now, as it was all along the river.
But he could see the old positions.
And now, along each side of the straight, flat, canal-bordered road they were making time on were the willows of the two canals that had contained the dead.
There had been a great killing at the last of the offensive and someone, to clear the river bank positions and the road in the hot weather, had ordered the dead thrown into the canals.
Unfortunately, the canal gates were still in the Austrians' hands down the river, and they were closed.
So there was little movement to the water, and the dead had stayed, there a long time, floating and bloating face up and face down regardless of nationality until they had attained colossal proportions.
Finally, after organization had been established, labour troops hauled them out at night and buried them close to the road.
The Colonel looked for added greenness close to the road but could not note any.
However, there were many ducks and geese in the canals, and men were fishing in them all along the road.
They dug them all up anyway, the Colonel thought, and buried them in that big ossario up by Nervesa.
'We fought along here when I was a kid,' the Colonel told the driver.
'It's a God-damn flat country to fight in,' the driver said.
'Did you hold that river?'.
'Yes,' the Colonel said.
'We held it and lost it and took it back again.
'There isn't a contour here as far as you can see.
'That was the trouble,' the Colonel said.
'You had to use contours you couldn't see, they were so small, and ditches and houses and canal banks and hedgerows.
It was like Normandy only flatter.
I think it must have been something like fighting in Holland.
'That river sure doesn't look anything like the Rapido.
'It was a pretty good old river,' the Colonel said.
'Up above, it had plenty of water then, before all these hydro-electric projects.
And it had very deep and tricky channels in the pebbles and shingle when it was shallow.
He knew how boring any man's war is to any other man, and he stopped talking about it.
They always take it personally, he thought.
No one is interested in it, abstractly, except soldiers and there are not many soldiers.
You make them and the good ones are killed, and above they are always bucking for something so hard they never look or listen.
They are always thinking of what they have seen and while you are talking they are thinking of what they will say and what it may lead to in their advancement or their privilege.
There was no sense boring this boy, who, for all his combat infantryman badge, his Purple Heart and the other things he wore, was in no sense a soldier but only a man placed, against his will, in uniform, who had elected to remain in the army for his own ends.
'What did you do in civil life, Jackson?' he asked.
'I was partners with my brother in a garage in Rawlins, Wyoming, sir.
'Are you going back there?'.
'My brother got killed in the Pacific and the guy who was running the garage was no good,' the driver said.
'We lost what we had put in it.
'That's bad,' the Colonel said.
'You're God-damned right it's bad,' the driver said and added, 'sir'.
The Colonel looked up the road.
He knew that if they kept on this road they would come, shortly, to the turn that he was waiting for; but he was impatient.
'Keep your eyes open and take a left hand turn on the road leading off this pike,' he told the driver.
'Do you think those low roads will be good with this big car, sir?'.
'We'll see,' the Colonel said.
'Hell, man, it hasn't rained in three weeks.
'I don't trust those side roads in this low country.
'If we get stuck, I'll haul you out with oxen.
'I was only thinking about the car, sir.
'Well, think about what I told you and turn off on the first left side road you see if it looks practicable.
'That looks like one coming up, from the hedges,' the driver said.
'You're all clear behind.
Pull up just ahead of it and I'll go over and have a look.
He stepped out of the car and walked across the wide, hard-surfaced road and looked at the narrow dirt road, with the swift flowing canal beside it, and the thick hedge beyond.
Beyond the hedge, he saw a low red farmhouse with a big barn.
The road was dry.
There were not even cart ruts sunk in it.
He got back into the car.
'It's a boulevard,' he said.
'Quit worrying.
'Yes, sir.
It's your car, sir.
'I know,' the Colonel said.
'I'm still paying for it.
Say, Jackson, do you always suffer so much any time you go off a highway on to a secondary road?'.
'No, sir.
But there's a lot of difference between a jeep, and a car as low hung as this.
Do you know the clearance you have on your differential and your body frame on this?'.
'I've got a shovel in the truck and we've got chains.
Wait till you see where we're going after we leave Venice.
'Do we go all the way in this car?'.
'I don't know.
I'll see.
'Think about your fenders, sir.
'We'll cut the fenders off like the Indians do in Oklahoma.
She's over-fendered right now.
She's got too much of everything except engine.
Jackson, that's a real engine she's got.
'It certainly is, sir.
It's a great pleasure to drive that big engine on the good roads.
That's why I don't want anything to happen to her.
'That's very good of you, Jackson.
Now just quit suffering.
'I'm not suffering, sir.
'Good,' said the Colonel.
He was not, either, because just then he saw, beyond the line of close-bunched brown trees ahead, a sail moving along.
It was a big red sail, raked sharply down from the peak, and it moved slowly behind the trees.
Why should it always move your heart to see a sail moving along through the country, the Colonel thought.
Why does it move my heart to see the great, slow, pale oxen? It must be the gait as well as the look of them and the size and the colour.
But a good fine big mule, or a string of pack mules in good condition, moves me, too.
So does a coyote every time I ever see one, and a wolf, gaited like no other animal, grey and sure of himself, carrying that heavy head and with the hostile eyes.
'Ever see any wolves out around Rawlins, Jackson?'.
'No, sir.
Wolves were gone before my time; they poisoned them out.
Plenty coyotes, though.
'Do you like coyotes?'.
'I like to hear them nights.
'So do I.
Better than anything, except seeing a ship sailing along through the country.
'There's a boat doing that over there, sir.
'On the Sile canal,' the Colonel told him.
'She's a sailing barge going to Venice.
This wind is off the mountains now and she makes it along pretty good.
It's liable to turn really cold to-night if this wind holds and it ought to bring in plenty ducks.
Turn to your left here and we'll run along the canal.
There's a good road.
'They didn't have much duck shooting where I came from.
But there was plenty of it in Nebraska along the Platte.
'Do you want to shoot where we're going?'.
'I don't believe so, sir.
I'm not much of a shot, and I'd rather stay in that sack.
It's a Sunday morning, you know.
'I know,' the Colonel said.
'You can stay in the sack until noon if you want.
'I brought my repellent.
I ought to sleep O.
'I'm not sure you'll need it,' the Colonel said.
'Did you bring any K-rations or Ten in One? They're liable to eat Italian food, you know.
'I brought a few cans to help out and a little stuff to give away.
'That's good,' the Colonel said.
He was looking ahead now to see where the canal road joined the main highway again.
There he knew that he would see it on a clear day such as this was.
Across the marshes, brown as those at the mouths of the Mississippi around Pilot Town are in winter, and with their reeds bent by the heavy north wind, he saw the squared tower of the church at Torcello and the high campanile of Burano beyond it.
The sea was a slate blue and he could see the sails of twelve sailing barges running with the wind for Venice.
I'll have to wait until we cross the Dese River above Noghera to see it perfectly, he thought.
It is strange to remember how we fought back there along the canal that winter to defend it and we never saw it.
Then one time, I was back as far as Noghera and it was clear and cold like to-day, and I saw it across the water.
But I never got into it.
It is my city, though, because I fought for it when I was a boy, and now that I am half a hundred years old, they know I fought for it and am a part owner and they treat me well.
Do you think that's why they treat you well, he asked himself.
Maybe, he thought.
Maybe they treat me well because I'm a chicken colonel on the winning side.
I don't believe it, though.
I hope not, anyway.
It is not France, he thought.
There you fight your way into a city that you love and are very careful about breaking anything and then, if you have good sense, you are careful not to go back because you will meet some military characters who will resent your having fought your way in.
Vive la France et les pommes de terre frites.
Liberté, Venalité, et Stupidité.
The great clarte of the French military thinking.
They haven't had a military thinker since du Picq.
He was a poor bloody Colonel, too.
Mangin, Maginot and Gamelin.
Take your choice, Gentlemen.
Three schools of thought.
One; I hit them on the nose.
Two; I hide behind this thing which does not cover my left flank.
Three; I hide my head in the sand like an ostrich, confident in the greatness of France as a military power and then take off.
Take off is putting it very cleanly and pleasantly.
Sure, he thought, whenever you over-simplify you become unjust.
Remember all the fine ones in the Resistance, remember Foch both fought and organized and remember how fine the people were.
Remember your good friends and remember your deads.
Remember plenty things and your best friends again and the finest people that you know.
Don't be a bitter nor a stupid.
And what has that to do with soldiering as a trade? Cut it out, he told himself.
You're on a trip to have fun.
'Jackson,' he said, 'are you happy?'.
'Yes, sir.
'Good.
Shortly, we are coming to a view that I want you to see.
You only have to take one look at it.
The entire operation will be practically painless.
I wonder what he's riding me for now, the driver thought.
Just because he was a B.
once he knows everything.
If he was any good as a B.
why didn't he hold it? He's been beat up so much he's slug-nutty.
'There's the view, Jackson,' the Colonel said.
'Stop her by the side of the road and we'll take a look.
The Colonel and the driver walked over to the Venice side of the road and looked across the lagoon that was whipped by the strong, cold wind from the mountains that sharpened all the outlines of buildings so that they were geometrically clear.
'That's Torcello directly opposite us,' the Colonel pointed.
'That where the people lived that were driven off the mainland by the Visigoths.
They built that church you see there with the square tower.
There were thirty thousand people lived there once and they built that church to honour their Lord and to worship him.
Then, after they built it, the mouth of the Sile River silted up or a big flood changed it, and all that land we came through just now got flooded and started to breed mosquitoes and malaria hit them.
They all started to die, so the elders got together and decided they should pull out to a healthy place that would be defensible with boats, and where the Visigoths and the Lombards and the other bandits couldn't get at them, because these bandits had no sea-power.
The Torcello boys were all great boatmen.
So they took the stones of all their houses in barges, like that one we just saw, and they built Venice.
He stopped.
'Am I boring you, Jackson?'.
'No, sir.
I had no idea who pioneered Venice.
'It was the boys from Torcello.
They were very tough and they had very good taste in building.
They came from a little place up the coast called Caorle.
But they drew on all the people from the towns and the farms behind when the Visigoths overran them.
It was a Torcello boy who was running arms into Alexandria, who located the body of St.
Mark and smuggled it out under a load of fresh pork so the infidel customs guards wouldn't check him.
This boy brought the remains of St.
Mark to Venice, and he's their patron saint and they have a cathedral there to him.
But by that time, they were trading so far to the east that the architecture is pretty Byzantine for my taste.
They never built any better than at the start there in Torcello.
That's Torcello there.
It was, indeed.
'St Mark's square is where the pigeons are and where they have that big cathedral that looks sort of like a moving picture palace, isn't it?'.
'Right, Jackson.
You're on the ball.
If that's the way you look at it.
Now you look beyond Torcello you will see the lovely campanile on Burano that has damn near as much list on it as the leaning tower of Pisa.
That Burano is a very over-populated little island where the women make wonderful lace, and the men make bambinis and work day-times in the glass factories in that next island you see on beyond with the other campanile, which is Murano.
They make wonderful glass day-times for the rich of all the world, and then they come home on the little vaporetto and make bambinis.
Not everyone passes every night with his wife though.
They hunt ducks nights too, with big punt guns, out along the edge of the marshes on this lagoon you're looking across now.
All night long on a moonlight night you hear the shots.
' He paused.
'Now when you look past Murano you see Venice.
That's my town.
There's plenty more I could show you, but I think we probably ought to roll now.
But take one good look at it.
This is where you can see how it all happened.
But nobody ever looks at it from here.
'It's a beautiful view.
Thank you, sir.
,' the Colonel said.
'Let's roll.
Chapter V.
But he continued to look and it was all as wonderful to him and it moved him as it had when he was eighteen years old and had seen it first, understanding nothing of it and only knowing that it was beautiful.
The winter had come very cold that year and all the mountains were white beyond the plain.
It was necessary for the Austrians to try to break through at the angle where the Sile River and the old bed of the Piave were the only lines of defence.
If you had the old bed of the Piave then you had the Sile to fall back on if the first line did not hold.
Beyond the Sile there was nothing but bare-assed plain and a good road network into the Veneto plain and the plains of Lombardy, and the Austrians attacked again and again and again late through the winter, to try to get on to this fine road that they were rolling on now which led straight to Venice.
That winter the Colonel, who was a lieutenant then, and in a foreign army, which had always made him slightly suspect afterwards in his own army, and had done his career no good, had a sore throat all winter.
This sore throat was from being in the water so much.
You could not get dry and it was better to get wet quickly and stay wet.
The Austrian attacks were ill co-ordinated, but they were constant and exasperated and you first had the heavy bombardment which was supposed to put you out of business, and then, when it lifted, you checked your positions and counted the people.
But you had no time to care for wounded, since you knew that the attack was coming immediately, and then you killed the men who came wading across the marshes, holding their rifles above the water and coming as slow as men wade, waist deep.
If they did not lift the shelling when it started, the Colonel, then a lieutenant, often thought, I do not know what we would be able to do.
But they always lifted it and moved it back ahead of the attack.
If we had lost the old Piave and were on the Sile they would move it back to the second and third lines; although such lines were quite untenable, and they should have brought all their guns up very close and whammed it in all the time they attacked and until they breached us.
But thank God, some high fool always controls it, the Colonel thought, and they did it piecemeal.
All that winter, with a bad sore throat, he had killed men who came, wearing the stick bombs hooked up on a harness under their shoulders with the heavy, calf-hide packs and the bucket helmets.
They were the enemy.
But he never hated them; nor could have any feeling about them.
He commanded with an old sock around his throat, which had been dipped in turpentine, and they broke down the attacks with rifle fire and with the machine guns which still existed, or were usable, after the bombardment.
He taught his people to shoot, really, which is a rare ability in continental troops, and to be able to look at the enemy when they came, and, because there was always a dead moment when the shooting was free, they became very good at it.
But you always had to count and count fast after the bombardment to know how many shooters you would have.
He was hit three times that winter, but they were all gift wounds; small wounds in the flesh of the body without breaking bone, and he had become quite confident of his personal immortality since he knew he should have been killed in the heavy artillery bombardment that always preceded the attacks.
Finally, he did get hit properly and for good.
No one of his other wounds had ever done to him what the first big one did.
I suppose it is just the loss of the immortality, he thought.
Well, in a way, that is quite a lot to lose.
This country meant very much to him, more than he could, or would ever tell anyone and now he sat in the car happy that in another half hour they would be in Venice.
He took two mannitol hexanitrate tablets; since he had always been able to spit since 1918, he could take them dry, and asked:.
'How are you doing, Jackson?'.
'Fine, sir.
'Take the left outside road when we hit the fork for Mestre and we'll be able to see the boats along the canal and miss that main traffic.
'Yes, sir,' the driver said.
'Will you check me on the fork?'.
'Of course,' the Colonel said.
They were coming up on Mestre fast, and already it was like going to New York the first time you were ever there in the old days when it was shining, white and beautiful.
I stole that, he thought.
But that was before the smoke.
We are coming into my town, he thought.
Christ, what a lovely town.
They made the left turn and came along the canal where the fishing boats tied up, and the Colonel looked at them and his heart was happy because of the brown nets and the wicker fish traps and the clean, beautiful lines of the boats.
It's not that they are picturesque.
The hell with picturesque.
They are just damned beautiful.
They passed the long line of boats in the slow canal that carried water from the Brenta, and he thought about the long stretch of the Brenta where the great villas were, with their lawns and their gardens and the plane trees and the cypresses.
I'd like to be buried out there, he thought.
I know the place very well.
I don't believe you could fix it, though.
I don't know.
I know some people that might let me be buried on their place.
I'll ask Alberto.
He might think it was morbid, though.
For a long time he had been thinking about all the fine places he would like to be buried and what parts of the earth he would like to be a part of.
The stinking, putrefying part doesn't last very long, really, he thought, and anyway you are just a sort of mulch, and even the bones will be some use finally.
I'd like to be buried way out at the edge of the grounds, but in sight of the old graceful house and the tall, great trees.
I don't think it would be much of a nuisance to them.
I could be a part of the ground where the children play in the evenings, and in the mornings, maybe, they would still be training jumping horses and their hoofs would make the thudding on the turf, and trout would rise in the pool when there was a hatch of fly.
They were up on the causeway from Mestre to Venice now with the ugly Breda works that might have been Hammond, Indiana.
'What do they make there, sir?' Jackson asked.
'The company makes locomotives in Milan,' the Colonel said.
'Here they make a little of everything in the metallurgic line.
It was a miserable view of Venice now and he always disliked this causeway except that you made such good time and you could see the buoys and the channels.
'This town makes a living on its own,' he said to Jackson.
'She used to be the queen of the seas and the people are very tough and they give less of a good God-damn about things than almost anybody you'll ever meet.
It's a tougher town than Cheyenne when you really know it, and everybody is very polite.
'I wouldn't say Cheyenne was a tough town, sir.
'Well, it's a tougher town than Casper.
'Do you think that's a tough town, sir?'.
'It's an oil town.
It's a nice town.
'But I don't think it's tough, sir.
Or ever was.
, Jackson.
Maybe we move in different circles.
Or maybe we have a differing definition for the word.
But this town of Venice, with everybody being polite and having good manners, is as tough as Cooke City, Montana, on the day they have the Old Timers' Fish Fry.
'My idea of a tough town is Memphis.
'Not like Chicago, Jackson.
Memphis is only tough if you are a Negro.
Chicago is tough North, South, there isn't any East and West.
But nobody has any manners.
But in this country, if you ever want to know a really tough town where they eat wonderfully, too, go to Bologna.
'I never was there.
'Well, there's the Fiat garage where we leave the car,' the Colonel said.
'You can leave the key at the office.
They don't steal.
I'll go in the bar while you park upstairs.
They have people that will bring the bags.
'Is it O.
to leave your gun and shooting gear in the trunk, sir?'.
'Sure.
They don't steal here.
I told you that once.
'I wanted to take the necessary precautions, sir, on your valuable property.
'You're so damned noble that sometimes you stink,' the Colonel said.
'Get the wax out of your ears and hear what I say the first time.
'I heard you, sir,' Jackson said.
The Colonel looked at him contemplatively and with the old deadliness.
He sure is a mean son of a bitch, Jackson thought, and he can be so God-damn nice.
'Get my and your bag out and park her up there and check your oil, your water and your tyres,' the Colonel said, and walked across the oil and rubber stained cement of the entry of the bar.
Chapter VI.
In the bar, sitting at the first table as he came in, there was a post-war rich from Milan, fat and hard as only Milanese can be, sitting with his expensive looking and extremely desirable mistress.
They were drinking negronis, a combination of two sweet vermouths and seltzer water, and the Colonel wondered how much taxes the man had escaped to buy that sleek girl in her long mink coat and the convertible he had seen the chauffeur take up the long, winding ramp to lock away.
The pair stared at him with the bad manners of their kind and he saluted, lightly and said to them in Italian, 'I am sorry that I am in uniform.
But it is a uniform.
Not a costume.
Then he turned his back on them, without waiting to see the effect of his remark, and walked to the bar.
From the bar you could watch your luggage, just as well as the two pescecani were watching theirs.
He is probably a Commendatore, he thought.
She is a beautiful, hard piece of work.
She is damned beautiful, actually.
I wonder what it would have been like if I had ever had the money to buy me that kind and put them into the mink? I'll settle for what I have, he thought, and they can go and hang themselves.
The bar-tender shook hands with him.
This bar-tender was an Anarchist but he did not mind the Colonel being a Colonel at all.
He was delighted by it and proud and loving about it as though the Anarchists had a Colonel, too, and in some ways, in the several months that they had known each other, he seemed to feel that he had invented, or at least erected, the Colonel as you might be happy about participating in the erection of a campanile, or even the old church at Torcello.
The bar-tender had heard the conversation, or, rather, the flat statement at the table and he was very happy.
He had already sent down, via the dumb-waiter, for a Gordon's gin and Campari and he said, 'It is coming up in that hand-pulled device.
How does everything go at Trieste?'.
'About as you would imagine.
'I couldn't even imagine.
'Then don't strain,' the Colonel said, 'and you will never get piles.
'I wouldn't mind it if I was a Colonel.
'I never mind it.
'You'd be overrun like a dose of salts,' the waiter said.
'Don't tell the Honorable Pacciardi,' the Colonel said.
He and the bar-tender had a joke about this because the Honourable Pacciardi was Minister of Defence in the Italian Republic.
He was the same age as the Colonel and had fought very well in the first world war, and had also fought in Spain as a battalion commander where the Colonel had known him when he, himself, was an observer.
The seriousness with which the Honourable Pacciardi took the post of Minister of Defence of an indefensible country was a bond between the Colonel and the bar-tender.
The two of them were quite practical men and the vision of the Honourable Pacciardi defending the Italian Republic stimulated their minds.
'It's sort of funny up there,' the Colonel said, 'and I don't mind it.
'We must mechanize the Honourable Pacciardi,' the bar-tender said.
'And supply him with the atomic bomb.
'I've got three of them in the back of the car,' the Colonel said.
'The new model, complete with handles.
But we can't leave him unarmed.
We must supply him with botulism and anthrax.
'We cannot fail the Honourable Pacciardi,' the bar-tender said.
'Better to live one day as a lion than a hundred years as a sheep.
'Better to die on our feet than to live on our knees,' the Colonel said.
'Though you better get on your belly damn fast if you want to stay alive in plenty places.
'Colonel, do not say anything subversive.
'We will strangle them with our bare hands,' the Colonel said.
'A million men will spring to arms overnight.
'Whose arms?' the bar-tender asked.
'All that will be attended to,' the Colonel said.
'It's only a phase in the Big Picture.
Just then the driver came in the door.
The Colonel saw that while they had been joking, he had not watched the door and he was annoyed, always, with any lapse of vigilance or of security.
'What the hell's been keeping you, Jackson? Have a drink.
'No, thank you, sir.
You prissy jerk, the Colonel thought.
But I better stop riding him; he corrected.
'We'll be going in a minute,' the Colonel said.
'I've been trying to learn Italian from my friend here.
' He turned to look at the Milan profiteers; but they were gone.
I'm getting awfully slow, he thought.
Somebody will take me any day now.
Maybe even the Honourable Pacciardi, he thought.
'How much do I owe you?' he asked the bar-tender shortly.
The bar-tender told him and looked at him with his wise Italian eyes, not merry now, although the lines of merriment were clearly cut where they radiated from the corners of each eye.
I hope there is nothing wrong with him, the bar-tender thought.
I hope to God, or anything else, there's nothing really bad.
'Good-bye, my Colonel,' he said.
'Ciao,' the Colonel said.
'Jackson, we are going down the long ramp and due north from the exit to where the small launches are moored.
The varnished ones.
There is a porter with the two bags.
It is necessary to let them carry them since they have a concession.
'Yes, sir,' said Jackson.
The two of them went out the door and no one looked back at anyone.
At the imbarcadero, the Colonel tipped the man who had carried their two bags and then looked around for a boatman he knew.
He did not recognize the man in the launch that was first on call, but the boatman said, 'Good day, my Colonel.
I'm the first.
'How much is it to the Gritti?'.
'You know as well as I, my Colonel.
We do not bargain.
We have a fixed tariff.
'What's the tariff?'.
'Three thousand five hundred.
'We could go on the vaporetto for sixty.
'And nothing prevents you going,' the boatman, who was an elderly man with a red but un-choleric face, said.
'They won't take you to the Gritti but they will stop at the imbarcadero past Harry's, and you can telephone for someone from the Gritti to get your bags.
And what would I buy with the God-damn three thousand five hundred lire; and this is a good old man.
'Do you want me to send that man there?' he pointed to a destroyed old man who did odd jobs and ran errands around the docks, always ready with the un-needed aid to the elbow of the ascending or descending passenger, always ready to help when no help was needed, his old felt hat held out as he bowed after the unneeded act.
'He'll take you to the vaporetto.
There's one in twenty minutes.
'The hell with it,' the Colonel said.
'Take us to the Gritti.
'Con piacere,' the boatman said.
The Colonel and Jackson lowered themselves into the launch which looked like a speed boat.
It was radiantly varnished and lovingly kept and was powered with a marine conversion of a tiny Fiat engine that had served its allotted time in the car of a provincial doctor and had been purchased out of one of the graveyards of automobiles; those mechanical elephant cemeteries that are the one certain thing you may find in our world near any populated centre; and been re-conditioned and re-converted to start this new life on the canals of this city.
'How is the motor doing?' the Colonel asked.
He could hear her sounding like a stricken tank or T.
, except the noises were in miniature from the lack of power.
'So-so,' the boatman said.
He moved his free hand in a parallel motion.
'You ought to get the smallest model Universal puts out.
That's the best and lightest small marine engine I know.
'Yes,' the boatman said.
'There are quite a few things I should get.
'Maybe you'll have a good year.
'It's always possible.
Lots of pescecani come down from Milano to gamble at the Lido.
But nobody would ride twice in this thing on purpose.
As a boat, it is fine, too.
It is a well built, pleasant boat.
Not beautiful as a gondola is, of course.
But it needs an engine.
'I might get you a jeep engine.
One that was condemned and you could work it over.
'Don't talk about such things,' the boatman said.
'Things like that don't happen.
I don't want to think about it.
'You can think about it,' the Colonel said.
'I'm talking true.
'You mean it.
'Sure.
I don't guarantee anything.
I'll see what I can do.
How many children have you got?'.
'Six.
Two male and four female.
'Hell, you mustn't have believed in the Regime.
Only six.
'I didn't believe in the Regime.
'You don't have to give me that stuff,' the Colonel said.
'It would have been quite natural for you to have believed in it.
Do you think I hold that against a man after we've won?'.
They were through the dull part of the canal that runs from Piazzale Roma to Ca'Foscari, though none of it is dull, the Colonel thought.
It doesn't all have to be palaces nor churches.
Certainly that isn't dull.
He looked to the right, the starboard, he thought.
I'm on the water.
It was a long low pleasant building and there was a trattoria next to it.
I ought to live here.
On retirement pay I could make it all right.
No Gritti Palace.
A room in a house like that and the tides and the boats going by.
I could read in the mornings and walk around town before lunch and go every day to see the Tintorettos at the Accademia and to the Sculoa San Rocco and eat in good cheap joints behind the market or, maybe, the woman that ran the house would cook in the evenings.
I think it would be better to have lunch out and get some exercise walking.
It's a good town to walk in.
I guess the best, probably.
I never walked in it that it wasn't fun.
I could learn it really well, he thought, and then I'd have that.
It's a strange, tricky town and to walk from any part to any other given part of it is better than working crossword puzzles.
It's one of the few things to our credit that we never smacked it, and to their credit that they respected it.
Christ, I love it, he said, and I'm so happy I helped defend it when I was a punk kid, and with an insufficient command of the language and I never even saw her until that clear day in the winter when I went back to have that small wound dressed, and saw her rising from the sea.
Merde, he thought, we did very well that winter up at the junction.
I wish I could fight it again, he thought.
Knowing what I know now and having what we have now.
But they'd have it too and the essential problem is just the same, except who holds the air.
And all this time he had been watching the bow of the beat-up beautifully varnished, delicately brass-striped boat, with the brass all beautifully polished, cut the brown water and seen the small traffic problems.
They went under the white bridge and under the unfinished wood bridge.
Then they left the red bridge on the right and passed under the first high-flying white bridge.
Then there was the black iron fret-work bridge on the canal leading into the Rio Nuovo and they passed the two stakes chained together but not touching: like us the Colonel thought.
He watched the tide pull at them and he saw how the chains had worn the wood since he first had seen them.
That's us, he thought.
That's our monument.
And how many monuments are there to us in the canals of this town?.
Then they still went slowly until the great lantern that was on the right of the entrance to the Grand Canal where the engine commenced its metallic agony that produced a slight increase in speed.
Now they came down and under the Accademia between the pilings where they passed, at touching distance, a heavily loaded black, diesel boat full of cut timber, cut to chunks, to burn for firewood in the damp houses of the Sea City.
'That's beech, isn't it?' the Colonel asked the boatman.
'Beech and another wood that is cheaper that I do not recall, at this moment, the name of.
'Beech is, to an open fire, as anthracite coal is to a stove.
Where do they cut that beech?'.
'I'm not a man of the mountains.
But I think it comes from up beyond Bassano on the other side of the Grappa.
I went there to the Grappa to see where my brother was buried.
It was an excursion that they made from Bassano, and we went to the big ossario.
But we returned by Feltre.
I could see it was a fine timber country on the other side as you came down the mountains into the valley.
We came down that military road, and they were hauling lots of wood.
'In what year was your brother killed on Grappa?'.
'In nineteen-eighteen.
He was a patriot and inflamed by hearing d'Annunzio talk, and he volunteered before his class was called.
We never knew him very well because he went so quickly.
'How many were you in the family?'.
'We were six.
We lost two beyond the Isonzo, one on the Bainsizza and one on the Carso.
Then we lost this brother I speak of on the Grappa and I remained.
'I'll get you the God-damned jeep complete with handles,' the Colonel said.
'Now let's not be morbid and look for all the places where my friends live.
They were moving up the Grand Canal now and it was easy to see where your friends lived.
'That's the house of the Contessa Dandolo,' the Colonel said.
He did not say, but thought, she is over eighty, and she is as gay as a girl and does not have any fear of dying.
She dies her hair red and it looks very well.
She is a good companion and an admirable woman.
Her palazzo was pleasant looking, set well back from the Canal with a garden in front and a landing place of its own where many gondolas had come, in their various times, bringing hearty, cheerful, sad and disillusioned people.
But most of them had been cheerful because they were going to see the Contessa Dandolo.
Now, beating up the Canal, against the cold wind off the mountains, and with the houses as clear and sharp as on a winter day, which, of course, it was, they saw the old magic of the city and its beauty.
But it was conditioned, for the Colonel, by his knowing many of the people who lived in the palazzos; or if no one lived there now, knowing to what use the different places had been put.
There's Alvarito's mother's house, he thought, and did not say.
She never lives there much and stays out at the country house near Treviso where they have trees.
She's tired of there not being trees in Venice.
She lost a fine man and nothing really interests her now except efficiency.
But the family at one time lent the house to George Gordon, Lord Byron, and nobody sleeps now in Byron's bed nor in the other bed, two flights below, where he used to sleep with the gondolier's wife.
They are not sacred, nor relics.
They are just extra beds that were not used afterwards for various reasons, or possibly to respect Lord Byron who was well loved in this town, in spite of all the errors he committed.
You have to be a tough boy in this town to be loved, the Colonel thought.
They never cared anything for Robert Browning, nor Mrs.
Robert Browning, nor for their dog.
They weren't Venetians no matter how well he wrote of it.
And what is a tough boy, he asked himself.
You use it so loosely you should be able to define it.
I suppose it is a man who will make his play and then backs it up.
Or just a man who backs his play.
And I'm not thinking of the theatre, he thought.
Lovely as the theatre can be.
And yet, he thought, seeing now the little villa, close up against the water, ugly as a building you would see on the boat train from Havre or Cherbourg, coming into the banlieue before Paris as you came into town.
It was overrun with badly administered trees, and not a place that you would live in if you could help it.
There he lived.
They loved him for his talent, and because he was bad, and he was brave.
A Jewish boy with nothing, he stormed the country with his talent, and his rhetoric.
He was a more miserable character than any that I know and as mean.
But the man I think of to compare him with never put the chips on the line and went to war, the Colonel thought, and Gabriele d'Annunzio (I always wondered what his real name was, he thought, because nobody is named d'Annunzio in a practical country and perhaps he was not Jewish and what difference did it make if he was or was not) had moved through the different arms of the service as he had moved into and out of the arms of different women.
All the arms were pleasant that d'Annunzio served with and the mission was fast and easily over, except the Infantry.
He remembered how d'Annunzio had lost an eye in a crash, flying as an observer, over Trieste or Pola, and how, afterwards, he had always worn a patch over it and people who did not know, for, then, no one really knew, thought it had been shot out at the Veliki or San Michele or some other bad place beyond the Carso where everyone died, or was incapacitated, that you knew.
But d'Annunzio, truly, was only making heroic gestures with the other things.
An Infantryman knows a strange trade, he thought; perhaps the strangest.
He, Gabriele, flew, but he was not a flier.
He was in the Infantry but he was not an Infantryman and it was always the same appearances.
And the Colonel remembered one time when he had stood, commanding a platoon of assault troops, while it was raining in one of the interminable winters, when the rain fell always; or at least, always when there were parades or speeches to the troops, and d'Annunzio, with his lost eye, covered by the patch, and his white face, as white as the belly of a sole, new turned over in the market, the brown side not showing, and looking thirty hours dead, was shouting.
'Morire non a basta,' and the Colonel, then a lieutenant, had thought, 'What the muck more do they want of us?'.
But he had followed the discourse and, at the end, when the Lieutenant-Colonel d'Annunzio, writer and national hero, certified and true if you must have heroes, and the Colonel did not believe in heroes, asked for a moment of silence for our glorious dead, he had stood stiffly to attention.
But his platoon, who had not followed the speech, there being no loud speakers then, and they being slightly out of hearing of the orator, responded, as one man, at the pause for the moment of silence for our glorious dead, with a solid and ringing 'Evviva d'Annunzio'.
They had been addressed before by d'Annunzio after victories, and before defeats, and they knew what they should shout if there was any pause by an orator.
The Colonel, being then a lieutenant, and loving his platoon, had joined with them and uttered, with the tone of command, 'Evviva d'Annunzio', thus absolving all those who had not listened to the discourse, speech, or harangue and attempting, in the small way a lieutenant can attempt anything, except to hold an indefensible position; or intelligently direct his own part in an attack; to share their guilt.
But now he was passing the house where the poor beat-up old boy had lived with his great, sad and never properly loved actress and he thought of her wonderful hands and her so transformable face, that was not beautiful, but that gave you all love, glory and delight and sadness; and of the way the curve of her forearm could break your heart, and he thought, Christ they are dead and I do not know where either one is buried even.
But I certainly hope they had fun in that house.
'Jackson,' he said, 'that small villa on the left belonged to Gabriele d'Annunzio, who was a great writer.
'Yes, sir,' said Jackson, 'I'm glad to know about him.
I never heard of him.
'I'll check you out on what he wrote if you ever want to read him,' the Colonel said.
'There are some fair English translations.
'Thank you, sir,' said Jackson.
'I'd like to read him any time I have time.
He has a nice practical looking place.
What did you say the name was?'.
'D'Annunzio,' the Colonel said.
'Writer.
He added to himself, not wishing to confuse Jackson, nor be difficult, as he had been with the man several times that day, writer, poet, national hero, phraser of the dialectic of Fascism, macabre egotist, aviator, commander, or rider, in the first of the fast torpedo attack boats, Lieutenant-Colonel of Infantry without knowing how to command a company, nor a platoon properly, the great, lovely writer of Notturno whom we respect, and jerk.
Up ahead now there was a crossing place of gondolas at the Santa Maria del Giglio and, beyond, was the wooden dock of the Gritti.
'That's the hotel where we are stopping at, Jackson.
The Colonel indicated the three-storey, rose-coloured, small, pleasant palace abutting on the Canal.
It had been a dependence of the Grand Hotel—but now it was its own hotel and a very good one.
It was probably the best hotel, if you did not wish to be fawned on, or fussed over, or over-flunkied, in a city of great hotels and the Colonel loved it.
'It looks O.
to me, sir,' Jackson said.
'It is O.
,' the Colonel said.
The motor boat came gallantly up beside the piling of the dock.
Every move she makes, the Colonel thought, is a triumph of the gallantry of the ageing machine.
We do not have war horses now like old Traveller, or Marbot's Lysette who fought, personally, at Eylau.
We have the gallantry of worn through-rods that refuse to break; the cylinder head that does not blow though it has every right to and the rest of it.
'We're at the dock, sir,' Jackson said.
'Where the hell else would we be, man.
Jump out while I settle with this sportsman.
He turned to the boatman and said, 'That was thirty-five hundred, wasn't it?'.
'Yes, my Colonel.
'I'll not forget about the over-age jeep engine.
Take this and buy your horse some oats.
The porter, who was taking the bags from Jackson, heard this and laughed.
'No veterinarian will ever fix his horse.
'She still runs,' the boatman said.
'But she doesn't win any races,' the porter said.
'How are you, my Colonel?'.
'I couldn't be better,' the Colonel said.
'How are all the members of the Order?'.
'All members are well.
'Good,' said the Colonel.
'I will go in and see the Grand Master.
'He is waiting for you, my Colonel.
'Let us not keep him waiting, Jackson,' the Colonel said.
'You may proceed to the lobby with this gentleman and tell them to sign me in.
See the sergeant gets a room,' he said to the porter.
'We're here for the night only.
'The Baron Alvarito was here looking for you.
'I'll find him at Harry's.
'Good, my Colonel.
'Where is the Grand Master?'.
'I'll find him for you.
'Tell him I'll be in the bar.
Chapter VII.
The bar was just across from the lobby of the Gritti, although lobby the Colonel thought, was not the accurate term to describe that gracious entrance.
Didn't Giotto describe a circle, he thought? No, that was in maths.
What he remembered and loved best as an anecdote about that painter was: 'It was easy,' said Giotto as he drew the perfect circle.
Who the hell had said that and where?.
'Good evening, Privy Councillor,' he said to the bar-man, who was not a full paid-up member of the order but whom he did not wish to offend.
'What can I do for you?'.
'Drink, my Colonel.
The Colonel looked out of the windows and the door of the bar on to the waters of the Grand Canal.
He could see the big black hitching post for the gondolas and the later afternoon winter light on the wind-swept water.
Across the Canal was the old Palace and a wood barge, black and broad, was coming up the Canal, her bluff bows pushing up a wave even though she had the wind behind her.
'Make it a very dry Martini,' the Colonel said.
'A double.
Just then the Grand Master came into the room.
He was wearing his formal attire as a head waiter.
He was truly handsome as a man should be, from the inside out, so that his smile starts from his heart, or whatever is the centre of the body, and comes frankly and beautifully to the surface, which is the face.
He had a fine face with the long, straight nose of his part of the Veneto; the kind, gay, truthful eyes and the honourable white hair of his age, which was two years older than that of the Colonel.
He advanced smiling, lovingly and yet conspiratorially, since they both shared many secrets and he extended his hand, which was a big, long, strong, spatular-fingered hand; well kept as was becoming, as well as necessary, to his position and the Colonel extended his own hand, which had been shot through twice and was slightly misshapen.
Thus contact was made between two old inhabitants of the Veneto, both men and brothers in their membership in the human race, the only club that either one paid dues to and brothers, too, in their love of an old country, much fought over and always triumphant in defeat, which they had both defended in their youth.
Their handshake was only long enough to feel, firmly, the contact and the pleasure of meeting and then the Maitre d'Hotel said, 'My Colonel.
The Colonel said, 'Gran Maestro.
Then the Colonel asked the Gran Maestro to accompany him in a drink, but the Maitre d'Hotel said that he was working.
It was impossible as well as forbidden.
'—— forbidden,' said the Colonel.
'Of course,' the Gran Maestro said.
'But everyone must comply with his duty and here the rules are reasonable and we all should comply with them; me especially, as a matter of precept.
'Not for nothing are you the Gran Maestro,' the Colonel said.
'Give me a small Carpano punto e mezzo,' the Gran Maestro said to the bar-tender, who was still outside of the Order for some small, not defined, unstated reason.
'To drink to the ordine.
Thus, violating orders and the principle of precept and example in command, the Colonel and the Gran Maestro downed a quick one.
They did not hurry nor did the Gran Maestro worry.
They simply made it fast.
'Now, let us discuss the affairs of the Order,' the Colonel said.
'Are we in the secret chamber?'.
'We are,' said the Gran Maestro.
'Or I declare it to be such.
'Continue,' said the Colonel.
The Order, which was a purely fictitious organization, had been founded in a series of conversations between the Gran Maestro and the Colonel.
Its name was El Ordine Militar, Nobile y Espirituoso de los Caballeros de Brusadelli.
The Colonel and the head waiter both spoke Spanish and since that is the best language for founding orders, they had used it in the naming of this one, which was named after a particularly notorious multi-millionaire non-taxpaying profiteer of Milan, who had, in the course of a dispute over property, accused his young wife, publicly and legally through due process of law, of having deprived him of his judgment through her extraordinary sexual demands.
'Gran Maestro,' the Colonel said.
'Have you heard from our Leader, The Reverend One?'.
'Not a word.
He is silent these days.
'He must be thinking.
'He must.
'Perhaps he is meditating on new and more distinguished shameful acts.
'Perhaps.
He has not given me any word.
'But we can have confidence in him.
'Until he dies,' the Gran Maestro said.
'After that he can roast in hell and we will revere his memory.
'Giorgio,' the Colonel said.
'Give the Gran Maestro another short Carpano.
'If it is your order,' the Gran Maestro said, 'I can only obey.
They touched glasses.
'Jackson,' the Colonel called.
'You're on the town.
You can sign here for chow.
I don't want to see you until eleven hundred to-morrow in the lobby, unless you get into trouble.
Do you have money?'.
'Yes, sir,' Jackson said and thought, the old son of a bitch really is as crazy as they say.
But he might have called me instead of shouting.
'I don't want to see you,' the Colonel said.
Jackson had entered the room and stood before him at a semblance of attention.
'I'm tired of seeing you, because you worry and you don't have fun.
For Christ sake have yourself some fun.
'Yes, sir.
'You understand what I said?'.
'Yes, sir.
'Repeat it.
'Ronald Jackson, T5 Serial Number 100678, will present himself in the lobby of this Gritti Hotel at 11.
00 to-morrow morning, I don't know the date, sir, and will absent himself from the Colonel's sight and will have some fun.
Or,' he added, 'will make every reasonable attempt to attain that objective.
'I'm sorry, Jackson,' the Colonel said.
'I'm a ——.
'I beg to differ with the Colonel,' Jackson said.
'Thank you, Jackson,' the Colonel told him.
'Maybe I'm not.
I hope you are correct.
Now muck off.
You've got a room here, or you should have and you can sign for chow.
Now try and have some fun.
'Yes, sir,' said Jackson.
When he was gone, the Gran Maestro said to the Colonel, 'What is the boy? One of those sad Americans?'.
'Yes,' the Colonel said.
'And by Jesus Christ we've got a lot of them.
Sad, self-righteous, over-fed and undertrained.
If they are under-trained, it is my fault.
But we've got some good ones, too.
'Do you think they would have done Grappa, Pasubio and the Basso Piave as we did?'.
'The good ones, yes.
Maybe better.
But you know, in our army, they don't even shoot for self-inflicted wounds.
'Jesus,' said the Gran Maestro.
He and the Colonel both remembered the men who decided that they did not wish to die, not thinking that he who dies on Thursday does not have to die on Friday and how one soldier would wrap another's puttee-ed leg in a sandbag so there would be no powder burns and loose off at his friend from as far a distance as he figured he could hit the calf of the leg without hitting bone and then fire twice over the parapet to alibi the shot.
They had this knowledge shared between them and it was for this reason and for a true, good hatred of all those who profited by war that they had founded the Order.
They knew, the two of them, who loved and respected each other, how poor boys who did not want to die, would share the contents of a match-box to produce the infection that would keep them from the next murderous frontal attack.
They knew about the other boys who put the big ten-centime pieces under their arm-pits to produce jaundice.
And they knew, too, about the richer boys who, in different cities, had paraffin injected under their knee-caps so they would not have to go to the war.
They knew how garlic could be used to produce certain effects which could absent a man from an attack and they knew all, or nearly all, of the other tricks; for one had been a sergeant and the other a lieutenant of infantry and they had fought on the three key points, Pasubio, Grappa and the Piave, where it all made sense.
They had fought, too, in the earlier stupid butchery on the Isonzo and the Carso.
But they were both ashamed of those who had ordered that and they never thought about it except as a shameful, stupid thing to be forgotten and the Colonel remembered it technically as something to learn from.
So, now, they had founded the Order of Brusadelli; noble, military and religious, and there were only five members.
'What is the news of the Order?' the Colonel asked the Gran Maestro.
'We have ascended the cook at the Magnificent to the rank of Commendatore.
He comported himself as a man three times on his fiftieth birthday.
I accepted his statement without corroboration.
He never lied ever.
'No.
He never lied.
But it is a topic on which you must be chary in your credibility.
'I believed him.
He looked ruined.
'I can remember him when he was a tough kid and we called him the cherry buster.
'Anch' io.
'Have you any concrete plans for the Order during the winter?'.
'No, Supreme Commander.
'Do you think we should give a homage to the Honourable Pacciardi?'.
'As you wish.
'Let's defer it,' the Colonel said.
He thought a moment, and signalled for another dry Martini.
'Do you think we might organize a homage and manifestation in some historic place such as San Marco or the old Church at Torcello in favour of our Great Patron, Brusadelli, the Revered One?'.
'I doubt if the religious authorities would permit it at this moment.
'Then let us abandon all ideas of public manifestations for this winter, and work within our cadres, for the good of the Order.
'I think that is soundest,' the Gran Maestro said.
'We will regroup.
'And how are you, yourself?'.
'Awful,' the Gran Maestro said.
'I have low blood pressure, ulcers and I owe money.
'Are you happy?'.
'All the time,' the Gran Maestro said.
'I like my work very much and I meet extraordinary and interesting characters, also many Belgians.
They are what we have instead of the locusts this year.
Formerly we had the Germans.
What was it Caesar said, 'And the bravest of these are the Belgians.
' But not the best dressed.
Do you agree?'.
'I've seen them quite well costumed in Brussels,' the Colonel said.
'A well-fed, gay capital.
Win, lose, or draw.
'We should have fought in Flanders in the old days.
'We were not born in the old days,' the Colonel said.
'So we automatically could not have fought then.
'I wish we could have fought with the Condottieri when all you had to do was out-think them and they conceded.
You could think and I would convey your orders.
'We'd have to take a few towns for them to respect our thinking.
'We would sack them if they defended them,' the Gran Maestro said.
'What towns would you take?'.
'Not this one,' the Colonel said.
'I'd take Vicenza, Bergamo and Verona.
Not necessarily in that order.
'You'd have to take two more.
'I know,' the Colonel said.
He was a general now again and he was happy.
'I figured that I'd by-pass Brescia.
It could fall of its own weight.
'And how are you, Supreme Commander?' the Gran Maestro said, for this taking of towns had pulled him out of his depth.
He was at home in his small house in Treviso, close to the fast-flowing river under the old walls.
The weeds waved in the current and the fish hung in the shelter of the weeds and rose to insects that touched the water in the dusk.
He was at home, too, in all operations that did not involve more than a company and understood them as clearly as he understood the proper serving of a small dining-room; or a large dining-room.
But when the Colonel became a general officer again, as he had once been and thought in terms that were as far beyond him as calculus is distant from a man who has only the knowledge of arithmetic, then he was not at home and their contact was strained and he wished the Colonel would return to things they both knew together when they were a lieutenant and a sergeant.
'What would you do about Mantova?' the Colonel asked.
'I do not know, my Colonel.
I do not know whom you are fighting, nor what forces are at your disposal.
'I thought you said we were Condottieri.
Based on this town or on Padova.
'My Colonel,' the Gran Maestro said, and he had diminished in no way, 'I know nothing, truly, about Condottieri.
Nor really how they fought then.
I only said I would like to fight under you in such times.
'There aren't any such times any more,' the Colonel said and the spell was broken.
What the hell, maybe there never was any spell, the Colonel thought.
The hell with you, he said to himself.
Cut it out and be a human being when you're half a hundred years old.
'Have another Carpano,' he said to the Gran Maestro.
'My Colonel, you will allow me to refuse because of the ulcers?'.
'Yes.
Yes.
Of course.
Boy, what's your name, Giorgio? Another dry Martini.
Secco, molto secco e doppio.
Breaking spells, he thought.
It is not my trade.
My trade is killing armed men.
A spell should be armed if I'm to break it.
But we have killed many things which were not armed.
All right, spell breaker, retract.
'Gran Maestro,' he said.
'You are still Gran Maestro and —— the Condottieri.
'They were —— many years ago, Supreme Commander.
'Exactly,' the Colonel said.
But the spell was broken.
'I'll see you at dinner,' the Colonel said.
'What is there?'.
'We will have anything you wish and what we do not have I will send out for.
'Do you have any fresh asparagus?'.
'You know we cannot have it in these months.
It comes in April and from Bassano.
'Then you think of something and I'll eat it,' the Colonel said,.
'How many will you be?' the Maitre d'Hotel asked.
'We'll be two,' the Colonel said.
'What time do you close the bistro?'.
'We will serve dinner as late as you wish to eat, my Colonel.
'I'll try to be in at a sound hour,' the Colonel said.
'Good-bye, Gran Maestro,' he said and smiled and gave the Gran Maestro his crooked hand.
'Good-bye, Supreme Commander,' said the Gran Maestro and the spell was existent again and almost complete.
But it was not quite complete and the Colonel knew it and he thought: why am I always a bastard and why can I not suspend this trade of arms and be a kind and good man as I would have wished to be.
I try always to be just, but I am brusque and I am brutal and it is not that I have erected the defence against brown-nosing my superiors and brown-nosing the world.
I should be a better man with less wild boar blood in the small time which remains.
We will try it out to-night, he thought.
With whom, he thought and where, and God help me not to be bad.
'Giorgio,' he said to the barman, who had a face as white as a leper, but with no bulges and without the silver shine.
Giorgio did not really like the Colonel very much, or perhaps he was simply from Piemonte and cared for no one truly; which was understandable in cold people from a border province.
Borderers are not trusters and the Colonel knew about this and expected nothing from anyone that they did not have to give.
'Giorgio,' he said to the pale-faced barman.
'Write these down for me, please.
He went out, walking as he had always walked, with a slightly exaggerated confidence, even when it was not needed and, in his always renewed plan of being kind, decent and good, he greeted the concierge, who was a friend, the assistant manager, who spoke Swahili and had been a prisoner of war in Kenya and was a most amiable man, young, full of juice, handsome, perhaps not yet a member of the Order, and experienced.
'And the cavaliere ufficiale who manages this place?' he asked.
'My friend?'.
'He is not here,' the assistant manager said.
'For the moment, naturally,' he added.
'Give him my compliments,' the Colonel said.
'And have somebody show me to my room.
'It is the usual room.
You still wish it?'.
'Yes.
Have you taken care of the Sergeant?'.
'He is well taken care of.
'Good,' said the Colonel.
The Colonel proceeded to his room accompanied by the boy who carried his bag.
'This way, my Colonel,' the boy said, when the elevator halted with slight hydraulic inaccuracy at the top floor.
'Can't you run an elevator properly?' the Colonel asked.
'No, my Colonel,' the boy said.
'The current is not stable.
Chapter VIII.
The colonel said nothing and preceded the boy down the corridor.
It was large, wide and high ceilinged and there was a long and distinguished interval between the doors of the rooms on the side of the Grand Canal.
Naturally, since it had been a palace, there were no rooms without excellent views, except those which had been made for the servants.
The Colonel found the walk long, although it was a very short one and when the waiter, who served the room, appeared, short, dark and with his glass eye in the left eye socket, gleaming, unable to smile his full, true smile as he worked the big key in the lock, the Colonel wished that the door would open more rapidly.
'Open it up,' he said.
'I will, my Colonel,' the waiter said.
'But you know these locks.
Yes, the Colonel thought.
I know them, but I wish that he would get it open.
'How are your family?' he said to the waiter, who had swung the door wide so that the Colonel, now entered, was within the room with the high, dark but well-mirrored armoire, the two good beds, the great chandelier and the view, through the still closed windows, on to the wind-beaten water of the Grand Canal.
The Canal was grey as steel now in the quick, failing, winter light and the Colonel said, 'Arnaldo, open the windows.
'There is much wind, my Colonel, and the room is badly heated due to the lack of electric power.
'Due to the lack of rainfall,' the Colonel said.
'Open the windows.
All of them.
'As you wish, my Colonel.
The waiter opened the windows and the north wind came into the room.
'Please call the desk and ask them to ring this number.
' The waiter made the call while the Colonel was in the bathroom.
'The Contessa is not at home, my Colonel,' he said.
'They believe you might find her at Harry's.
'You find everything on earth at Harry's.
'Yes, my Colonel.
Except, possibly, happiness.
'I'll damn well find happiness, too,' the Colonel assured him.
'Happiness, as you know, is a movable feast.
'I am aware of that,' the waiter said.
'I have brought Campari bitters and a bottle of Gordon Gin.
May I make you a Campari with gin and soda?'.
'You're a good boy,' the Colonel said.
'Where did you bring them from.
The bar?'.
'No.
I bought them while you were away so that you would not have to spend money at the bar.
The bar is very costly.
'I agree,' the Colonel agreed.
'But you should not use your own money on such a project.
'I took a chance.
We have both taken many.
The gin was 3200 lire and is legitimate.
The Campari was 800.
'You're a very good boy,' the Colonel told him.
'How were the ducks?'.
'My wife still speaks of them.
We had never had wild ducks, since they are of such expense, and outside of our way of life.
But one of our neighbours told her how to prepare them and these same neighbours ate them with us.
I never knew that anything could be so wonderful to eat.
When your teeth close on the small slice of meat it is an almost unbelievable delight.
'I think so, too.
There is nothing lovelier to eat than those fat iron-curtain ducks.
You know their fly-way is through the great grain fields of the Danube.
This is a splinter flight we have here, but they always come the same way since before there were shot-guns.
'I know nothing about shooting for sport,' the waiter said.
'We were too poor.
'But many people without money shoot in the Veneto.
'Yes.
Of course.
One hears them shoot all night.
But we were poorer than that.
We were poorer than you can know, my Colonel.
'I think I can know.
'Perhaps,' the waiter said.
'My wife also saved all the feathers and she asked me to thank you.
'If we have any luck the day after to-morrow, we'll get plenty.
The big ducks with the green heads.
Tell your wife, with luck, there will be good eating ducks, fat as pigs with what they have eaten from the Russians and with beautiful feathers.
'How do you feel about the Russians, if it is not indiscreet to ask, my Colonel?'.
'They are our potential enemy.
So, as a soldier, I am prepared to fight them.
But I like them very much and I have never known finer people nor people more as we are.
'I have never had the good fortune to know them.
'You will, boy.
You will.
Unless the Honourable Pacciardi stops them on the line of the Piave, which is a river which no longer contains water.
It has been siphoned off for hydro-electric projects.
Perhaps the Honorable Pacciardi will fight there.
But I do not think he will fight for long.
'I do not know the Honourable Pacciardi.
'I know him,' said the Colonel.
'Now ask them to ring Harry's and see if the Contessa is there.
If not, have them ring the house again.
The Colonel took the drink Arnaldo, the glass-eyed waiter, made him.
He did not want it and he knew that it was bad for him.
But he took it with his old wild-boar truculence, as he had taken everything all of his life and he moved, still cat-like when he moved, although it was an old cat now, over to the open window and looked out on the great Canal which was now becoming as grey as though Degas had painted it on one of his greyest days.
'Thanks very much for the drink,' the Colonel said and Arnaldo, who was talking into the telephone, nodded and smiled his glass-eyed smile.
I wish he did not have to have that glass eye, the Colonel thought.
He only loved people, he thought, who had fought or been mutilated.
Other people were fine and you liked them and were good friends; but you only felt true tenderness and love for those who had been there and had received the castigation that everyone receives who goes there long enough.
So I'm a sucker for cripes, he thought, drinking the unwanted drink.
And any son of a bitch who has been hit solidly, as every man will be if he stays, then I love him.
Yes, his other, good side said.
You love them.
I'd rather not love anyone, the Colonel thought.
I'd rather have fun.
And fun, his good side said to him, you have no fun when you do not love.
All right.
I love more than any son of the great bitch alive, the Colonel said, but not aloud.
Aloud, he said, 'Where are you getting on that call, Arnaldo?'.
'Cipriani has not come in,' the waiter said.
'They are expecting him at any moment and I am keeping the line open in case he arrives.
'A costly procedure,' the Colonel said.
'Get me a reading on who's there so we don't waste time.
I want to know exactly who is there.
Arnaldo spoke guardedly into the mouthpiece of the telephone.
He covered the mouth of the phone with his hand and said, 'I am talking to Ettore.
He says the Barone Alvarito is not there.
The Count Andrea is there and he is rather drunk, Ettore says, but not too drunk for you to have fun together.
The group of ladies that comes in each afternoon are there and there is a Greek princess, that you know and several people that you do not know.
Riff-raff from the American Consulate who have stayed on since noon.
'Tell him to call back when the riff-raff goes and I'll come over.
Arnaldo spoke into the phone, then turned to the Colonel who was looking out of the window at the Dome of the Dogana, 'Ettore says he will try to move them, but he is afraid Cipriani will not like it.
'Tell him not to move them.
They don't have to work this afternoon and there is no reason why they should not get drunk like any other man.
I just don't want to see them.
'Ettore says he will call back.
He told me to tell you he thinks the position will fall of its own weight.
'Thank him for calling,' the Colonel said.
He watched a gondola working up the Canal against the wind and thought, not with Americans drinking.
I know they are bored.
In this town, too.
They are bored in this town.
I know the place is cold and their wages are inadequate and what fuel costs.
I admire their wives, for the valiant efforts they make to transport Keokuk to Venice, and their children already speak Italian like little Venetians.
But no snapshots to-day, Jack.
To-day we are giving the snapshots, the bar-room confidences, the unwanted comradely drinks and the tedious woes of the Consular services a miss.
'No second, third or fourth vice-consuls to-day, Arnaldo.
'There are some very pleasant people from the Consulate.
'Yeah,' the Colonel said.
'They had a hell of a nice consul here in 1918.
Everybody liked him.
I'll try to remember his name.
'You go back a long way back, my Colonel.
'I go back so damn far back that it isn't funny.
'Do you remember everything from the old days?'.
'Everything,' the Colonel said.
'Carroll was the man's name.
'I have heard of him.
'You weren't born then.
'Do you think it is necessary to have been born at the time to know about things that have happened in this town, my Colonel?'.
'You're perfectly correct.
Tell me, does everybody always know about everything that happens in this town?'.
'Not everybody.
But nearly everybody,' the waiter said.
'After all, sheets are sheets and someone has to change them and someone has to wash them.
Naturally I do not refer to the sheets in a hotel such as this.
'I've had some damn good times in my life without sheets.
'Naturally.
But the gondoliers, while they are the most co-operative and, for me, the finest people that we have, speak among themselves.
'Naturally.
'Then the clergy.
While they would never violate the secrecy of the confessional, talk among themselves.
'It is to be expected.
'Their housekeepers talk among themselves.
'It is their right.
'Then the waiters,' Arnaldo said.
'People talk at a table as though the waiter were stone-deaf.
The waiter, according to his ethics, makes no attempt to ever overhear a conversation.
But sometimes he cannot escape from hearing.
Naturally, we have our own conversations among ourselves.
Never in this hotel of course.
I could go on.
'I believe I get the point.
'Not to mention the coiffeurs and the hair-dressers.
'And what's the news from the Rialto now?'.
'You will get it all at Harry's except the part you figure in.
'Do I figure?'.
'Everyone knows everything.
'Well, it's a damn pleasant story.
'Some people don't understand the Torcello part.
'I'm damned if I do sometimes myself.
'How old are you, my Colonel, if it is not too indiscreet to ask?'.
'Fifty plus one.
Why didn't you find out from the concierge? I fill out a slip there for the Questura.
'I wanted to hear it from you yourself and to congratulate you.
'I don't know what you are talking about.
'Let me congratulate you anyway.
'I can't accept it.
'You are very well liked in this city.
'Thank you.
That is a very great compliment.
Just then the telephone buzzed.
'I'll take it,' the Colonel said and heard Ettore's voice say, 'Who speaks?'.
'Colonel Cantwell.
'The position has fallen, my Colonel.
'Which way did they go?'.
'Towards the Piazza.
'Good.
I will be there at once.
'Do you want a table?'.
'In the corner,' said the Colonel and hung up.
'I am off for Harry's.
'Good hunting.
'I hunt ducks day after tomorrow before first light in a botte in the marshes.
'It will be cold, too.
'I dare say,' the Colonel said and put on his trench coat and looked at his face in the glass of the long mirror as he put on his cap.
'An ugly face,' he said to the glass.
'Did you ever see a more ugly face?'.
'Yes,' said Arnaldo.
'Mine.
Every morning when I shave.
'We both ought to shave in the dark,' the Colonel told him and went out the door.
Chapter IX.
As Colonel Cantwell stepped out of the door of the Gritti Palace Hotel he came out into the last sunlight of that day.
There was still sunlight on the opposite side of the Square but the gondoliers preferred to be sheltered from the cold wind by lounging in the lee of the Gritti, than to use the last remaining heat of the sun on the wind-swept side of the Square.
After noting this, the Colonel turned to the right and walked along the Square to the paved street which turned off on the right.
As he turned, he stopped for a moment and looked at the church of Santa Maria del Giglio.
What a fine, compact, and yet ready to be air-borne building, he thought.
I never realized a small church could look like a P47.
Must find out when it was built and who built it.
Damn, I wish I might walk around this town all my life.
All my life, he thought.
What a gag that is.
A gag to gag on.
A throttle to throttle you with.
Come on, boy, he said to himself.
No horse named Morbid ever won a race.
Besides, he thought, as he looked in the windows of the various shops he passed, the charcuteri with the Parmesan cheeses and the hams from San Daniele and the sausages alla cacciatora and the bottles of good Scotch whisky and real Gordon's gin, the cutlery store, an antique dealer's with some good pieces and some old maps and prints, a second-rate restaurant disguised expensively as one of the first class and then came to the first bridge crossing a feeder canal with steps to be climbed; I don't feel so badly.
There is only the buzzing.
I remember when that started and I thought perhaps it was seven-year locusts in the trees and I did not like to ask young Lowry but I did.
And he answered, 'No, General, I don't hear any crickets or seven-year locusts.
The night is perfectly quiet except for the usual noises.
Then, as he climbed, he felt the twinges and coming down the other side, he saw two lovely looking girls.
They were beautiful and hatless and poorly but chicly dressed, and they were talking very fast to each other and the wind was blowing their hair as they climbed with their long, easy striding Venetian legs and the Colonel said to himself, 'I'd better quit window gazing along this street and make that next bridge and two squares afterwards you turn due right and keep along it till you are in Harry's.
He did just that, twinging on the bridge, but walking with his same old stride and only seeing, quickly, the people that he passed.
There's a lot of oxygen in this air, he thought, as he faced into the wind and breathed deeply.
Then he was pulling open the door of Harry's bar and was inside and he had made it again and was at home.
At the bar a tall, very tall, man, with a ravaged face of great breeding, merry blue eyes and the long, loose-coupled body of a buffalo wolf said, 'My ancient and depraved Colonel.
'My wicked Andrea.
They embraced and the Colonel felt the rough texture of Andrea's handsome tweed coat that must have been entering, at least, its twentieth year.
'You look well, Andrea,' the Colonel said.
It was a lie and they both knew it.
'I am,' said Andrea, returning the lie.
'I must say I never felt better.
You look extraordinarily well, yourself.
'Thank you, Andrea.
Us healthy bastards shall inherit the earth.
'Very good idea.
I must say I wouldn't mind inheriting something these days.
'You have no kick.
You'll inherit well over six feet four of it.
'Six feet six,' said Andrea.
'You wicked old man.
Are you still slaving away at la vie militaire?'.
'I don't slave too hard at it,' the Colonel said.
'I'm down to shoot at San Relajo.
'I know.
But don't make jokes in Spanish at this hour.
Alvarito was looking for you.
He said to tell you he'd be back.
'Good.
Is your lovely wife and are the children well?'.
'Absolutely, and they asked me to remember them to you if I saw you.
They're down in Rome.
There comes your girl.
Or one of your girls.
' He was so tall he could see into the now almost dark street, but this was a girl you could recognize if it was much darker than it was at this hour.
'Ask her to have a drink with us here before you carry her off to that corner table.
Isn't she a lovely girl?'.
'She is.
Then she came into the room, shining in her youth and tall striding beauty and the carelessness the wind had made of her hair.
She had a pale, almost olive-coloured skin, a profile that could break your, or anyone else's, heart and her dark hair, of an alive texture, hung down over her shoulders.
'Hello, my great beauty,' the Colonel said.
'Oh, oh, hello,' she said.
'I thought I would miss you.
I am so sorry to be late.
Her voice was low and delicate and she spoke English with caution.
'Ciao, Andrea,' she said.
'How is Emily and are the children?'.
'Probably just the same as when I answered that same question for you at noon.
'I am so sorry,' she said and blushed.
'I am so excited and I always say the wrong things.
What should I say? Have you had a good time here all afternoon?'.
'Yes,' said Andrea.
'With my old friend and severest critic.
'Who is that?'.
'Scotch whisky and water.
'I suppose if he must tease me he must,' she said to the Colonel.
'But you won't tease me, will you?'.
'Take him over to that corner table and talk to him.
I'm tired of you both.
'I'm not tired of you,' the Colonel told him.
'But I think it is a good idea.
Should we have a drink sitting down, Renata?'.
'I'd love to if Andrea isn't angry.
'I'm never angry.
'Would you have a drink with us, Andrea?'.
'No,' said Andrea.
'Get along to your table.
I'm sick of seeing it unoccupied.
'Good-bye, Carlo.
Thanks for the drink we didn't have.
'Ciao, Ricardo,' Andrea said and that was all.
He turned his fine, long, tall back on them and looked into the mirror that is placed behind bars so a man can tell when he is drinking too much and decided that he did not like what he saw there.
'Ettore,' he said.
'Please put this nonsense on my bill.
He walked out after waiting carefully for his coat, swinging into it and tipping the man who brought it exactly what he should be tipped plus twenty per cent.
At the corner table, Renata said, 'Do you think we hurt his feelings?'.
'No.
He loves you and he likes me.
'Andrea is so nice.
And you're so nice.
'Waiter,' the Colonel called; then asked, 'Do you want a dry Martini, too?'.
'Yes,' she said.
'I'd love one.
'Two very dry Martinis,' the Colonel said.
'Montgomerys.
Fifteen to one.
The waiter, who had been in the desert, smiled and was gone and the Colonel turned to Renata.
'You're nice,' he said.
'You're also very beautiful and lovely and I love you.
'You always say that and I don't know what it means but I like to hear it.
'How old are you now?'.
'Nearly nineteen.
Why?'.
'And you don't know what it means?'.
'No.
Why should I? Americans always say it to you before they go away.
It seems to be necessary to them.
But I love you very much, too, whatever that is.
'Let's have a fine time,' the Colonel said.
'Let's not think about anything at all.
'I would like that.
I cannot think very well this time of day at any rate.
'Here are the drinks,' the Colonel said.
'Remember not to say, chin-chin.
'I remember that from before.
I never say chin-chin, nor here's to you, nor bottoms up.
'We just raise the glass to each other and, if you wish, we can touch the edges.
'I wish,' she said.
The Martinis were icy cold and true Montgomerys and, after touching the edges, they felt them glow happily all through their upper bodies.
'And what have you been doing?' the Colonel asked.
'Nothing.
I still wait to go away to school.
'Where now?'.
'God knows.
Wherever I go to learn English.
'Turn your head and raise your chin once for me.
'You're not making fun?'.
'No.
I'm not making fun.
She turned her head and raised her chin, without vanity, nor coquetry and the Colonel felt his heart turn over inside him, as though some sleeping animal had rolled over in its burrow and frightened, deliciously, the other animal sleeping close beside.
'Oh, you,' he said.
'Would you ever like to run for Queen of Heaven?'.
'That would be sacrilegious.
'Yes,' he said.
'I suppose it would and I withdraw the suggestion.
'Richard,' she said.
'No, I can't say it.
'Say it.
'No.
The Colonel thought, I order you to say it.
And she said, 'Please never look at me like that.
'I'm sorry,' the Colonel said.
'I had just slipped into my trade unconsciously.
'And if we were such a thing as married would you practise your trade in the home?'.
'No.
I swear it.
I never have.
Not in my heart.
'With no one?'.
'With no one of your sex.
'I don't like that word your sex.
It sounds as though you were practising your trade.
'I throw my trade out of that God-damn window into the Grand Canal.
'There,' she said.
'You see how quickly you practise it?'.
'All right,' he said.
'I love you and my trade can gently leave.
'Let me feel your hand,' she said.
'It's all right.
You can put it on the table.
'Thank you,' the Colonel said.
'Please don't,' she said.
'I wanted to feel it because all last week, every night, or I think nearly every night, I dreamed about it and it was a strange mixed-up dream and I dreamed it was the hand of Our Lord.
'That's bad.
You oughtn't to do that.
'I know it.
That's just what I dreamed.
'You aren't on the junk, are you?'.
'I don't know what you mean and please don't make fun when I tell you something true.
I dreamed just as I say.
'What did the hand do?'.
'Nothing.
Or maybe that is not true.
Mostly it was just a hand.
'Like this one?' The Colonel asked, looking at the mis-shapen hand with distaste and remembering the two times that had made it that way.
'Not like.
It was that one.
May I touch it carefully with my fingers if it does not hurt?'.
'It does not hurt.
Where it hurts is in the head, the legs and the feet.
I don't believe there's any sensation in that hand.
'You're wrong,' she said.
'Richard.
There is very much sensation in that hand.
'I don't like to look at it much.
You don't think we could skip it?'.
'Of course.
But you don't have to dream about it.
'No.
I have other dreams.
'Yes.
I can imagine.
But I dream lately about this hand.
Now that I have touched it carefully, we can talk about funny things if you like.
What is there funny we should talk about?'.
'Let's look at the people and discuss them.
'That's lovely,' she said.
'And we won't do it with malice.
Only with our best wit.
Yours and mine.
'Good,' the Colonel said.
'Waiter, Ancora due Martini.
He did not like to call for Montgomerys in a tone that could be overheard because there were two obvious Britishers at the next table.
The male might have been wounded, the Colonel thought, although, from his looks, it seems unlikely.
But God help me to avoid brutality.
And look at Renata's eyes, he thought.
They are probably the most beautiful of all the beautiful things she has with the longest honest lashes I have ever seen and she never uses them for anything except to look at you honestly and straight.
What a damn wonderful girl and what am I doing here anyway? It is wicked.
She is your last and true and only love, he thought, and that's not evil.
It is only unfortunate.
No, he thought, it is damned fortunate and you are very fortunate.
They sat at a small table in the corner of the room and on their right there were four women at a larger table.
One of the women was in mourning; a mourning so theatrical that it reminded the Colonel of the Lady Diana Manners playing the nun in Max Reinhardt's 'The Miracle'.
This woman had an attractive, plump, naturally gay face and her mourning was incongruous.
At the table there was another woman who had hair three times as white as hair can be, the Colonel thought she, also, had a pleasant face.
There were two other women whose faces meant nothing to the Colonel.
'Are they lesbians?' he asked the girl.
'I do not know,' she said.
'They are all very nice people.
'I should say they are lesbians.
But maybe they are just good friends.
Maybe they are both.
It means nothing to me and it was not a criticism.
'You are nice when you are gentle.
'Do you suppose the word gentleman derives from a man who is gentle?'.
'I do not know.
' the girl said, and she ran her fingers very lightly over the scarred hand.
'But I love you when you are gentle.
'I'll try very hard to be gentle,' the Colonel said.
'Who do you suppose that son of a bitch is at the table beyond them?'.
'You don't stay gentle very long,' the girl said.
'Let us ask Ettore.
They looked at the man at the third table.
He had a strange face like an over-enlarged, disappointed weasel or ferret.
It looked as pock-marked and as blemished as the mountains of the moon seen through a cheap telescope and, the Colonel thought, it looked like Goebbels's face, if Herr Goebbels had ever been in a plane that burned and not been able to bale out before the fire reached him.
Above this face, which was ceaselessly peering, as though the answer might be found by enough well directed glances and by queries, there was black hair that seemed to have no connection with the human race.
The man looked as though he had been scalped and then the hair replaced.
Very interesting, the Colonel thought.
Can he be a compatriot? Yes, he must.
A little spit ran out of the corner of his mouth as he spoke, peeringly, with the elderly, wholesome looking woman who was with him.
She looks like anybody's mother in an illustration in The Ladies' Home Journal, the Colonel thought.
The Ladies' Home Journal was one of the magazines received regularly at the Officers's Club in Trieste and the Colonel looked through it when it came.
It is a wonderful magazine, he thought, because it combines sexology and beautiful foods.
It makes me hungry both ways.
But who do you suppose that character is? He looks like a caricature of an American who has been run one half way through a meat chopper and then been boiled, slightly, in oil.
I'm not being so gentle, he thought.
Ettore, with his emaciated face and his love of joking and fundamental and abiding disrespect, came over and the Colonel said, 'Who is that spiritual character?'.
Ettore shook his head.
The man was short and dark with glossy black hair that did not seem to go with his strange face.
He looked, the Colonel thought, as though he had forgotten to change his wig as he grew older.
Has a wonderful face though, the Colonel thought.
Looks like some of the hills around Verdun.
I don't suppose he could be Goebbels and he picked up that face in the last days when they were all playing at Gotterdammerung.
Komm' Susser Tod, he thought.
Well they sure bought themselves a nice big piece of Susser Tod at the end.
'You don't want a nice Susser Tod sandwich do you Miss Renata?'.
'I don't think so,' the girl said.
'Though I love Bach and I am sure Cipriani could make one.
'I was not talking against Bach,' the Colonel said.
'I know it.
'Hell,' the Colonel said.
'Bach was practically a co-belligerent.
As you were,' he added.
'I don't think we have to talk against me.
'Daughter,' the Colonel said.
'When will you learn that I might joke against you because I love you?'.
'Now,' she said.
'I've learned it.
But you know it's fun not to joke too rough.
'Good.
I've learned it.
'How often do you think of me during the week?'.
'All of the time.
'No.
Tell me truly.
'All of the time.
Truly.
'Do you think it is this bad for everyone?'.
'I wouldn't know,' the Colonel said.
'That's one of the things I would not know.
'I hope it's not this bad for everyone.
I had no idea it could be this bad.
'Well you know now.
'Yes,' the girl said.
'I know now.
I know now and for keeps and for always.
Is that the correct way to say it?'.
'I know now is enough,' the Colonel said.
'Ettore, that character with the inspiring face and the nice looking woman with him doesn't live at the Gritti does he?'.
'No,' Ettore said.
'He lives next door but he goes to the Gritti sometimes to eat.
'Good,' the Colonel said.
'It will be wonderful to see him if I should ever be down-hearted.
Who is the woman with him? His wife? His mother? His daughter?'.
'There you have me,' Ettore said.
'We haven't kept track of him in Venice.
He has aroused neither love, hate, dislike, fear nor suspicion.
Do you really want to know anything about him? I could ask Cipriani.
'Let us skip him,' the girl said.
'Is that how you say it?'.
'Let's skip him,' the Colonel said.
'When we have so little time, Richard.
He is rather a waste of time.
'I was looking at him as at a drawing by Goya.
Faces are pictures, too.
'Look at mine and I will look at yours.
Please skip the man.
He didn't come here to do anyone any harm.
'Let me look at your face and you not look at mine.
'No,' she said.
'That's not fair.
I have to remember yours all week.
'And what do I do?' the Colonel asked her.
Ettore came over, unable to avoid conspiracy and, having gathered his intelligence rapidly and as a Venetian should, said:.
'My colleague who works at his hotel, says that he drinks three or four highballs and then writes vastly and fluently far into the night.
'I daresay that makes marvellous reading.
'I daresay,' Ettore said.
'But it was hardly the method of Dante.
'Dante was another vieux con,' the Colonel said.
'I mean as a man.
Not as a writer.
'I agree,' Ettore said.
'I think you will find no one, outside of Firenze, who has studied his life who would not agree.
'Eff Florence,' the Colonel said.
'A difficult manoeuvre,' Ettore said.
'Many have attempted it but very few have succeeded.
Why do you dislike it, my Colonel?'.
'Too complicated to explain.
But it was the depot,' he said deposito, 'of my old regiment when I was a boy.
'That I can understand.
I have my own reasons for disliking it, too.
You know a good town?'.
'Yes,' said the Colonel.
'This one.
A part of Milano; and Bologna.
And Bergamo.
'Cipriani has a large store of vodka in case the Russians should come,' Ettore said, loving to joke rough.
'They'll bring their own vodka, duty free.
'Still I believe Cipriani is prepared for them.
'Then he is the only man who is,' the Colonel said.
'Tell him not to take any cheques from junior officers on the Bank of Odessa and thank you for the data on my compatriot.
I won't take more of your time.
Ettore left and the girl turned towards him and looked in his old steel eyes and put both her hands on his bad one and said, 'You were quite gentle.
'And you are most beautiful and I love you.
'It's nice to hear it anyway.
'What are we going to do about dinner?'.
'I will have to call my home and find out if I can come out.
'Why do you look sad now?'.
'Do I?'.
'Yes.
'I am not, really.
I am as happy as I ever am.
Truly.
Please believe me, Richard.
But how would you like to be a girl nineteen years old in love with a man over fifty years old that you knew was going to die?'.
'You put it a little bluntly,' the Colonel said.
'But you are very beautiful when you say it.
'I never cry,' the girl said.
'Never.
I made a rule not to.
But I would cry now.
'Don't cry,' the Colonel said.
'I'm gentle now and the hell with the rest of it.
'Say once again that you love me.
'I love you and I love you and I love you.
'Will you do your best not to die?'.
'Yes.
'What did the doctor say?'.
'So-so.
'Not worse?'.
'No,' he lied.
'Then let us have another Martini,' the girl said.
'You know I never drank a Martini until we met.
'I know.
But you drink them awfully well.
'Shouldn't you take the medicine?'.
'Yes,' the Colonel said.
'I should take the medicine.
'May I give it to you?'.
'Yes,' the Colonel said.
'You may give it to me.
They continued to sit at the table in the corner and some people went out and others came in.
The Colonel felt a little dizzy from the medicine and he let it ride.
That's the way it always is, he thought.
To hell with it.
He saw the girl watching him and he smiled at her.
It was an old smile that he had been using for fifty years, ever since he first smiled and it was still as sound as your grandfather's Purdey shot-gun.
I guess my older brother has that, he thought.
Well, he could always shoot better than I could and he deserves it.
'Listen, Daughter,' he said.
'Don't be sorry for me.
'I'm not.
Not at all.
I just love you.
'It isn't much of a trade is it?' He said oficio instead of trade, because they spoke Spanish together, too, when they left French and when they did not wish to speak English before other people.
Spanish is a rough language, the Colonel thought, rougher than a corncob sometimes.
But you can say what you mean in it and make it stick.
'Es un oficio bastante malo,' he repeated, 'loving me.
'Yes.
But it is the only one I have.
'Don't you write any more poetry?'.
'It was young girl poetry.
Like young girl painting.
Everyone is talented at a certain age.
At what age do you become old in this country, the Colonel thought.
No one is ever old in Venice, but they grow up very fast.
I grew up very rapidly in the Veneto myself and I was never as old as I was at twenty-one.
'How is your mother?' he asked lovingly.
'She is very well.
She does not receive and she sees almost no one because of her sorrow.
'Do you think she would mind if we had a baby?'.
'I don't know.
She is very intelligent, you know.
But I would have to marry someone, I suppose.
I don't really want to.
'We could be married.
'No,' she said.
'I thought it over and I thought we should not.
It is just a decision as the one about crying.
'Maybe you make wrong decisions.
Christ knows I've made a few and too many men are dead from when I was wrong.
'I think, perhaps, you exaggerate.
I don't believe you made many wrong decisions.
'Not many,' the Colonel said.
'But enough.
Three is plenty in my trade and I made all three.
'I'd like to know about them.
'They'd bore you,' the Colonel told her.
'They beat the hell out of me to remember them.
So what would they do to some outsider?'.
'Am I an outsider?'.
'No.
You're my true love.
My last and only and true love.
'Did you make them early or late? The decisions.
'I made them early.
In the middle.
And late.
'Wouldn't you tell me about them? I would like to have a share in your sad trade.
'The hell with them,' the Colonel said.
'They were made and they've all been paid for.
Only you can't pay for that.
'Can you tell me about that and why?'.
'No,' the Colonel said.
And that was the end of that.
'Then let's have fun.
'Let's,' the Colonel said.
'With our one and only life.
'Maybe there are others.
Other lives.
'I don't think so,' the Colonel said.
'Turn your head sideways, beauty.
'Like this?'.
'Like that,' the Colonel said.
'Exactly like that.
So, the Colonel thought, here we come into the last round and I do not know even the number of the round.
I have loved but three women and have lost them thrice.
You lose them the same way you lose a battalion; by errors of judgment; orders that are impossible to fulfil and through impossible conditions.
Also through brutality.
I have lost three battalions in my life and three women and now I have a fourth and loveliest and where the hell does it end?.
You tell me, General, and, incidentally, while we are discussing the matter and it is frank discussion of the situation and in no sense a Council of War, as you have so often pointed out to me General: GENERAL WHERE IS YOUR CAVALRY?.
I have thought so, he said to himself.
The Commanding Officer does not know where his cavalry is and his cavalry are not completely accurate as to their situation, nor their mission and they will, some of them, enough, muck off as cavalry have always mucked off in all the wars since they, the Cavalry, had the big horses.
'Beauty,' he said, 'Ma très chère et bien aimée.
I am very dull and I am sorry.
'You are never dull, to me, and I love you and I only wish we could be cheerful to-night.
'We damn well will be,' said the Colonel.
'Do you know anything particular we should be cheerful about?'.
'We might be cheerful about us, and about the town.
You've often been very cheerful.
'Yes,' the Colonel agreed.
'I have been.
'Don't you think we could do it once more?'.
'Sure.
Of course.
Why not?'.
'Do you see the boy with the wave in his hair, that is natural, and he only pushes it a little, skilfully, to be more handsome?'.
'I see him,' the Colonel said.
'He is a very good painter, but he has false teeth in front because he was a little bit pédéraste once and other pédérastes attacked him one night on the Lido when there was a full moon.
'How old are you?'.
'I will be nineteen.
'How do you know this?'.
'I know it from the Gondoliere.
This boy is a very good painter, for now.
There aren't any really good painters now.
But with false teeth, now, in his twenty-fifth year, what a thing.
'I love you very truly,' the Colonel said.
'I love you very truly, too.
Whatever that means in American.
I also love you in Italian, against all my judgment and all of my wishes.
'We shouldn't wish for too God-damn much,' the Colonel said.
'Because we are always liable to get it.
'I agree,' she said.
'But I would like to get what I wish for now.
Neither of them said anything and then the girl said, 'That boy, he is a man now, of course, and goes with very many women to hide what he is, painted my portrait once.
You can have it if you like.
'Thank you,' the Colonel said.
'I would love it.
'It is very romantic.
My hair is twice as long as it has ever been and I look as though I were rising from the sea without the head wet.
Actually, you rise from the sea with the hair very flat and coming to points at the end.
It is almost the look of a very nearly dead rat.
But Daddy paid him adequately for the portrait, and, while it is not truly me, it is the way you like to think of me.
'I think of you when you come from the sea too.
'Of course.
Very ugly.
But you might like to have this portrait for a souvenir.
'Your lovely mother would not mind?'.
'Mummy would not mind.
She would be glad to be rid of it, I think.
We have better pictures in the house.
'I love you and your mother both very much.
'I must tell her,' the girl said.
'Do you think that pock-marked jerk is really a writer?'.
'Yes.
If Ettore says so.
He loves to joke but he does not lie.
Richard, what is a jerk? Tell me truly.
'It is a little rough to state.
But I think it means a man who has never worked at his trade (oficio) truly, and is presumptuous in some annoying way.
'I must learn to use the term properly.
'Don't use it,' the Colonel said.
Then the Colonel asked, 'When do I get the portrait?'.
'To-night if you wish it.
I'll have someone wrap it and send it from the house.
Where will you hang it?'.
'In my quarters.
'And no one will come in and make remarks and speak badly of me?'.
'No.
They damn well will not.
Also I'll tell them it is a portrait of my daughter.
'Did you ever have a daughter?'.
'No.
I always wanted one.
'I can be your daughter as well as everything else.
'That would be incest.
'I don't think that would be so terrible in a city as old as this and that has seen what this city has seen.
'Listen, Daughter.
'Good,' she said.
'That was fine.
I liked it.
'All right,' the Colonel said and his voice was thickened a little.
'I liked it, too.
'Do you see now why I lore you when I know better than to do it?'.
'Look, Daughter.
Where should we dine?'.
'Wherever you like.
'Would you eat at the Gritti?'.
'Of course.
'Then call the house and ask for permission.
'No.
I decided not to ask permission but to send word where I was dining.
So they would not worry.
'But do you really prefer the Gritti?'.
'I do.
Because it is a lovely restaurant and it is where you live and anyone can look at us that wants to.
'When did you get like that?'.
'I have always been like that.
I have never cared what anyone thought, ever.
Nor have I ever done anything that I was ashamed of except tell lies when I was a little girl and be unkind to people.
'I wish we could be married and have five sons,' the Colonel said.
'So do I,' the girl said.
'And send them to the five corners of the world.
'Are there five corners to the world?'.
'I don't know,' she said.
'It sounded as though there were when I said it.
And now we are having run again, aren't we?'.
'Yes, Daughter,' the Colonel said.
'Say it again.
Just as you said it.
'Yes, Daughter.
'Oh,' she said.
'People must be very complicated.
Please may I take your hand?'.
'It's so damned ugly and I dislike looking at it.
'You don't know about your hand.
'That's a matter of opinion,' he said.
'I'd say you were wrong, Daughter.
'Maybe I am wrong.
But we're having fun again and whatever the bad thing was is gone now.
'It's gone the way the mist is burned off the hollows in broken ground when the sun comes out,' the Colonel said.
'And you're the sun.
'I want to be the moon, too.
'You are,' the Colonel told her.
'Also any particular planet that you wish to be and I will give you an accurate location of the planet.
Christ, Daughter, you can be a God-damn constellation if you like.
Only that's an airplane.
'I'll be the moon.
She has many troubles, too.
'Yes.
Her sorrows come regularly.
But she always fills before she wanes.
'She looks so sad to me sometimes across the Canal, that I cannot stand it.
'She's been around a long time,' the Colonel said.
'Do you think we should have one more Montgomery?' the girl asked and the Colonel noticed that the British were gone.
He had been noticing nothing but her lovely face.
I'll get killed sometime that way, he thought.
On the other hand it is a form of concentration I suppose.
But it is damned careless.
'Yes,' he said.
'Why not?'.
'They make me feel very good,' the girl said.
'They have a certain effect on me, too, the way Cipriani makes them.
'Cipriani is very intelligent.
'He's more than that.
He's able.
'Some day he'll own all Venice.
'Not quite all,' the Colonel disagreed.
'He'll never own you.
'No,' she said.
'Nor will anyone else unless you want me.
'I want you, Daughter.
But I don't want to own you.
'I know it,' the girl said.
'And that's one more reason why I love you.
'Let's get Ettore and have him call up your house.
You can tell them about the portrait.
'You are quite correct.
If you want the portrait to-night, I must speak to the butler to have it wrapped and sent.
I will also ask to speak to Mummy and tell her where we are dining, and, if you like, I will ask her permission.
'No,' the Colonel said.
'Ettore, two Montgomerys, super Montgomerys, with garlic olives, not the big ones, and please call the home of this lady and let her know when you have completed the communication.
And all of this as rapidly as possible.
'Yes, my Colonel.
'Now, Daughter, let us resume the having of the fun.
'It was resumed when you spoke,' she said.
Chapter X.
They were walking, now, along the right side of the street that led to the Gritti.
The wind was at their backs and it blew the girl's hair forward.
The wind parted her hair in the back and blew it forward about her face.
They were looking in the shop windows and the girl stopped in front of the lighted window of a jewellery shop.
There were many good pieces of old jewellery in the window and they stood and looked at them and pointed out the best ones to each other, unclasping their hands to do so.
'Is there anything you really want? I could get it in the morning.
Cipriani would loan me the money.
'No,' she said.
'I do not want anything but I notice that you never give me presents.
'You are much richer than I am.
I bring you small things from the PX and I buy you drinks and meals.
'And take me in gondolas and to lovely places in the country.
'I never thought you wanted presents of hard stones.
'I don't.
It is just the thought of giving and then one looks at them and thinks about them when they are worn.
'I'm learning,' the Colonel said.
'But what could I buy you on Army pay that would be like your square emeralds?'.
'But don't you see.
I inherited them.
They came from my grandmother, and she had them from her mother who had them from her mother.
Do you think it is the same to wear stones that come from dead people?'.
'I never thought about it.
'You can have them if you like, if you like stones.
To me they are only something to wear like a dress from Paris.
You don't like to wear your dress uniform, do you?'.
'No.
'You don't like to carry a sword, do you?'.
'No, repeat, no.
'You are not that kind of a soldier and I am not that sort of girl.
But some time give me something lasting that I can wear and be happy each time I wear it.
'I see,' the Colonel said.
'And I will.
'You learn fast about things you do not know,' the girl said.
'And you make lovely quick decisions.
I would like you to have the emeralds and you could keep them in your pocket like a lucky piece, and feel them if you were lonely.
'I don't put my hands much in my pockets when I'm working.
I usually twirl a stick, or something, or point things out with a pencil.
'But you could put your hand in your pocket only once in a long time and feel them.
'I'm not lonely when I'm working.
I have to think too hard to ever be lonely.
'But you are not working now.
'No.
Only preparing the best way to be overrun.
'I'm going to give them to you anyway.
I'm quite sure Mummy will understand.
Also I won't need to tell her for quite a long time.
She keeps no check on my things.
I'm sure my maid would never tell her.
'I don't think I should take them.
'You should, please, to give me pleasure.
'I'm not sure it's honourable.
'That is like not being sure whether you are a virgin.
What you do to give pleasure to another whom you love is most honourable.
'All right,' the Colonel said.
'I will take them for better or for worse.
'Now you say thank you,' the girl said and slipped them into his pocket as quickly and ably as a jewel thief might.
'I brought them with me because I have been thinking and deciding about this all week.
'I thought you thought about my hand.
'Don't be surly, Richard.
And you should never be stupid.
It is your hand you touch them with.
Didn't you think of that?'.
'No.
And I was stupid.
What would you like from that window?'.
'I would like that small Negro with the ebony face and the turban made of chip diamonds with the small ruby on the crown of the turban.
I should wear it as a pin.
Everyone wore them in the old days in this city and the faces were those of their confidential servants.
I have coveted this for a long time, but I wanted you to give it to me.
'I'll send it in the morning.
'No.
Give it to me when we have lunch before you go.
'Right,' the Colonel said.
'Now we must walk or we will be too late for dinner.
They started to walk, arm through arm, and as they went up the first bridge the wind lashed at them.
When the twinge came, the Colonel said to himself, the hell with that.
'Richard,' the girl said.
'Put your hand in your pocket to please me and feel them.
The Colonel did.
'They feel wonderful,' he said.
Chapter XI.
They came in, out of the wind and the cold, through the main entrance of the Gritti Palace Hotel, into the light and warmth of the lobby.
'Good evening, Contessa,' the concierge said.
'Good evening, my Colonel.
It must be cold outside.
'It is,' the Colonel said, and did not add any of the rough or obscene phrases about the extent of the cold, or the force of the wind, that he could ordinarily have employed, for their mutual pleasure when speaking, alone, with the concierge.
As they entered the long hallway that led to the big stairs and to the elevator, leaving, on your right, the entrance to the bar, the doorway on to the Grand Canal, and the entrance to the dining-room, the Gran Maestro came out of the bar.
He was wearing a formal white jacket, cut long, and he smiled at them and said, 'Good evening, my Countess.
Good evening, my Colonel.
'Gran Maestro,' the Colonel said.
The Gran Maestro smiled and, still bowing, said, 'We are dining in the bar at the far end.
There is no one here now in the winter time and the dining-room is too big.
I have saved your table.
We have a very fine lobster if you would like him to commence with.
'Is he really fresh?'.
'I saw him this morning when he came from the market in a basket.
He was alive and a dark green and completely unfriendly.
'Would you like lobster, Daughter, to start your dinner?'.
The Colonel was conscious of using the word, and so was the Gran Maestro, and so was the girl.
But to each one it meant a different thing.
'I wanted to have him for you in case any pescecani came in.
They are down now to gamble at the Lido.
I was not trying to sell him.
'I would love some lobster,' the girl said.
'Cold, and with mayonnaise.
The mayonnaise rather stiff.
' She said this in Italian.
'It isn't too expensive?' she said to the Colonel, seriously.
'Ay hija mia,' the Colonel said.
'Feel in your right pocket,' she said.
'I'll see that he is not too expensive,' the Gran Maestro said.
'Or I'll buy him myself.
I could get him quite easily with a week's wages.
'Sold to TRUST,' the Colonel said, this being the code designation of the task force occupying Trieste.
'He only costs me a day's wages.
'Put your hand in your right hand pocket and feel very rich,' the girl said.
The Gran Maestro had sensed this was a private joke and had gone; silently.
He was happy about the girl, whom he respected and admired, and he was happy for his Colonel.
'I am rich,' the Colonel said.
'But if you tease me about them, I will give them back, and on the linen tablecloth, and in public.
He was teasing rough in his turn; throwing in the counter-attack without even thinking.
'No, you won't,' she said.
'Because you love them already.
'I would take anything I love and throw it off the highest cliff you ever saw and not wait to hear it bounce.
'No, you wouldn't,' the girl said.
'You would not throw me off any high cliffs.
'No,' the Colonel agreed.
'And forgive me for talking badly.
'You didn't talk very badly and I didn't believe it anyway,' the girl told him.
'Now should I go to the women's room to comb my hair and make myself presentable, or should I come up to your room?'.
'Which do you wish?'.
'To come to your room, of course, and see how you live and how things are there.
'What about the hotel?'.
'Everything is known in Venice anyway.
But it is also known who my family are and that I am a good girl.
Also they know it is you and it is I.
We have some credit to exhaust.
'Good,' the Colonel said.
'By stairs or elevator?'.
'By elevator,' she said, and he heard the change in her voice.
'You can call a boy or we can run it ourselves.
'We run it ourselves,' the Colonel said.
'I checked out on elevators long ago.
It was a good ride with a slight bump, and a rectification at the end, and the Colonel thought: Checked out, eh? You better be checked out again.
The corridor was now not simply beautiful, but exciting, and putting the key into the lock was not a simple process, but a rite.
'Here it is,' the Colonel said when he swung the door open.
'What there is of it.
'It is charming,' the girl said.
'But it is awfully cold with the windows open.
'I'll close them.
'No, please.
Leave them open if you like it that way.
The Colonel kissed her and felt her wonderful, long, young, lithe and properly built body against his own body, which was hard and good, but beat-up, and as he kissed her he thought of nothing.
They kissed for a long time, standing straight, and kissing true, in the cold of the open windows that were on to the Grand Canal.
'Oh,' she said.
Then, 'Oh.
'We owe nothing,' the Colonel said.
'Not a thing.
'Will you marry me and will we have the five sons?'.
'I will! I will!'.
'The thing is that, would you?'.
'Of course.
'Kiss me once again and make the buttons of your uniform hurt me but not too much.
They stood there and kissed each other true.
'I have a disappointment for you, Richard,' she said.
'I have a disappointment about everything.
She said it as a flat statement and it came to the Colonel in the same way as a message came from one of the three battalions, when the battalion commander spoke the absolute truth and told you the worst.
'You are positive?'.
'Yes.
'My poor Daughter,' he said.
Now there was nothing dark about the word and she was his daughter, truly, and he pitied her and loved her.
'No matter,' he said.
'You comb yourself and make a new mouth and all that, and we will have a good dinner.
'Say once more, first, that you love me and make the buttons very tight.
'I love you,' the Colonel said quite formally.
Then he whispered into her ear as gently as he knew how to whisper, as his whisper was when they are fifteen feet away and you are a young lieutenant on a patrol, 'I love you only, my best and last and only and one true love.
'Good,' she said, and kissed him hard so he could feel the sweet salt of the blood inside his lip.
And I like that too, he thought.
'Now I will comb my hair and make my mouth new and you can watch me.
'Do you want me to shut the windows?'.
'No,' she said.
'We will do it all in the cold.
'Who do you love?'.
'You,' she said.
'And we don't have too much luck, do we?'.
'I don't know,' the Colonel said.
'Go ahead and comb your hair.
The Colonel went into the bathroom to wash up for dinner.
The bathroom was the only disappointing part of the room.
Due to the exigencies of the Gritti having been built as a palace, there had been no site for bathrooms at the time of building, and, later, when they were introduced, they had been built down the corridor and those entitled to use them gave due warning beforehand and water was heated and towels laid out.
This bathroom had been cut, arbitrarily, from a corner of the room and it was a defensive, rather than an attacking bathroom, the Colonel felt.
Washing, and forced to look in the mirror to check any traces of lipstick, he regarded his face.
It looks as though it had been cut out of wood by an indifferent craftsman, he thought.
He looked at the different welts and ridges that had come before they had plastic surgery, and at the thin, only to be observed by the initiate, lines of the excellent plastic operations after head wounds.
Well, that is what I have to offer as a gueule or a façade, he thought1 It is a damn poor offer.
The only thing is that it is tanned, and that takes some of the curse off of it.
But, Christ what an ugly man.
He did not notice the old used steel of his eyes nor the small long extending laugh wrinkles at the corners of his eyes, nor that his broken nose was like a gladiator's in the oldest statues.
Nor did he notice his basically kind mouth which could be truly ruthless.
The hell with you, he said to the mirror.
You beat-up, miserable.
Should we rejoin the ladles?.
He went out from the bathroom into the room, and he was as young as at his first attack.
Every worthless thing had been left in the bathroom.
As always, he thought.
That's the place for it.
Où sont les neiges d'antan? Où sont les neiges d'autrefois? Dans le pissoir toute la chose comme ça.
The girl, whose first name was Renata, had the doors of the tall armoire open.
They were all mirrored inside and she was combing her hair.
She was not combing it for vanity, nor to do to the Colonel what she knew it could and would do.
She was combing it with difficulty and without respect, and, since it was very heavy hair and as alive as the hair of peasants, or the hair of the beauties of the great nobility, it was resistant to the comb.
'The wind made it very tangled,' she said.
'Do you love me still?'.
'Yes,' the Colonel said.
'May I help you?'.
'No, I've done it all my life.
'You could stand sidewise.
'No.
All contours are for our five sons and for your head to rest on.
'I was only thinking of the face,' the Colonel said.
'But thank you for calling my attention.
My attention has been faulty again.
'I am over bold.
'No,' the Colonel said.
'In America, they make such things of wire and of sponge-rubber, such as you use in the seats of tanks.
You never know there, whether there is any truth in the matter, unless you are a bad boy, as I am.
'Here it is not that way,' she said, and, with the comb, swung her now parted hair forward so that it came below the line of her cheek and, slanting back, hung over her shoulders.
'Do you like it neat?'.
'It's not too neat but it is damn lovely.
'I could put it up and all that sort of thing if you value neatness.
But I cannot manage hairpins and it seems so silly.
' Her voice was so lovely and it always reminded him of Pablo Casals playing the 'cello that it made him feel as a wound does that you think you cannot bear.
But you can bear anything, he thought.
'I love you very much the way you are,' the Colonel said.
'And you are the most beautiful woman I have ever known, or seen, ever in paintings by good painters.
'I wonder why the portrait has not come.
'The portrait is lovely to have,' the Colonel said, and now he was a General again without thinking of it.
'But it is like skinning a dead horse.
'Please don't be rough,' the girl said.
'I don't feel at all like being rough to-night.
'I slipped into the jargon of my sale mètier.
'No,' she said.
'Please put your arms around me, gently and well.
Please.
It is not a dirty trade.
It is the oldest and the best, although most people who practise it are unworthy.
He held her as tight as he could without hurting and she said, 'I would not have you be a lawyer nor a priest.
Nor sell things.
Nor be a great success.
I love you to be in your trade and I love you.
Please whisper to me if you wish.
The Colonel whispered; holding her tight, and with his heart broken, honestly and fairly, in his whisper that was as barely audible as a silent dog whistle heard close to the ear, 'I love you, devil.
And you're my daughter, too.
And I don't care about our losses because the moon is our mother and our father.
And now let's go down to dinner.
He whispered this last so low that it was inaudible to anyone who did not love you.
'Yes,' the girl said.
'Yes.
But kiss me once more first.
Chapter XII.
They were at their table in the far corner of the bar, where the Colonel had both his flanks covered, and he rested solidly against the corner of the room.
The Gran Maestro knew about this, since he had been an excellent sergeant in a good company of infantry, in a first-rate regiment, and he would no more have seated his Colonel in the middle of a room than he would have taken up a stupid defensive position.
'The lobster,' the Gran Maestro said.
The lobster was imposing.
He was double the size a lobster should be, and his unfriendliness had gone with the boiling, so that now he looked a monument to his dead self; complete with protruding eyes and his delicate, far-extended antennae that were for knowing what rather stupid eyes could not tell him.
He looks a little bit like Georgie Patton, the Colonel thought.
But he probably never cried in his life when he was moved.
'Do you think that he will be tough?' he asked the girl in Italian.
'No,' the Gran Maestro assured them, still bowing with the lobster.
'He's truly not tough.
He's only big.
You know the type.
'All right,' the Colonel said.
'Serve him.
'And what will you drink?'.
'What do you want, Daughter?'.
'What you want?'.
'Capri Bianco,' the Colonel said.
'Secco and really cold.
'I have it ready,' said the Gran Maestro.
'We are having fun,' the girl said.
'We are having it again and without sorrow.
Isn't he an imposing lobster?'.
'He is,' the Colonel answered.
'And he better damn well be tender.
'He will be,' the girl told him.
'The Gran Maestro doesn't lie.
Isn't it wonderful to have people who do not lie?'.
'Very wonderful and quite rare,' the Colonel said.
'I was thinking just now of a man named Georgie Patton who possibly never told the truth in his life.
'Do you ever lie?'.
'I've lied four times.
But each time I was very tired.
That's not an excuse,' he added.
'I lied a lot when I was a little girl.
But mostly it was making up stories.
Or I hope so.
But I have never lied to my own advantage.
'I have,' said the Colonel.
'Four times.
'Would you have been a general if you had not lied?'.
'If I had lied as others lied, I would have been a three-star general.
'Would it make you happier to be a three-star general?'.
'No,' said the Colonel.
'It would not.
'Put your right hand, your real hand, in your pocket once and tell me how you feel.
The Colonel did so.
'Wonderful,' he said.
'But I have to give them back you know.
'No.
Please, no.
'We won't go into it now.
Just then the lobster was served.
It was tender, with the peculiar slippery grace of that kicking muscle which is the tail, and the claws were excellent; neither too thin, nor too fat.
'A lobster fills with the moon,' the Colonel told the girl.
'When the moon is dark he is not worth eating.
'I didn't know that.
'I think it may be because, with the full moon, he feeds all night.
Or maybe it is that the full moon brings him feed.
'They come from the Dalmatian coast do they not?'.
'Yes,' the Colonel said.
'That's your rich coast in fish.
Maybe I should say our rich coast.
'Say it,' the girl said.
'You don't know how important things that are said are.
'They are a damn sight more important when you put them on paper.
'No,' the girl said.
'I don't agree.
The paper means nothing unless you say them in your heart.
'And what if you haven't a heart, or your heart is worthless?'.
'You have a heart and it is not worthless.
I would sure as hell like to trade it in on a new one, the Colonel thought.
I do not see why that one, of all the muscles, should fail me.
But he said nothing of this, and put his hand in his pocket.
'They feel wonderful,' he said.
'And you look wonderful.
'Thank you,' she said.
'I will remember that all week.
'You could always just look in the glass.
'The mirror bores me,' she said.
'Putting on lipstick and moving your lips over each other to get it spread properly and combing your too heavy hair is not a life for a woman, or even a girl alone, who loves someone.
When you want to be the moon and various stars and live with your man and have five sons, looking at yourself in the mirror and doing the artifices of a woman is not very exciting.
'Then let us be married at once.
'No,' she said.
'I had to make a decision about that, as about the other different things.
All week long is my time to make decisions.
'I make them, too,' the Colonel told her.
'But I am very vulnerable on this.
'Let's not talk about it.
It makes a sweet hurt, but I think we would do better to find out what the Gran Maestro has for meat.
Please drink your wine.
You haven't touched it.
'I'll touch it now,' the Colonel said.
He did and it was pale and cold like the wines of Greece, but not resinous, and its body was as full and as lovely as that of Renata.
'It's very like you.
'Yes.
I know.
That's why I wanted you to taste it.
'I'm tasting it,' the Colonel said.
'Now I will drink a full glass.
'You're a good man.
'Thank you,' the Colonel said.
'I'll remember that all week and try to be one.
' Then he said, 'Gran Maestro.
When the Gran Maestro came over, happy, conspiratorial, and ignoring his ulcers, the Colonel asked him, 'What sort of meat have you that is worth our eating?'.
'I'm not quite sure I know,' the Gran Maestro said.
'But I will check.
Your compatriot is over there in hearing distance.
He would not let me seat him in the far corner.
'Good,' the Colonel said.
'We'll give him something to write about.
'He writes every night, you know.
I've heard that from one of my colleagues at his hotel.
'Good,' the Colonel said.
'That shows that he is industrious even if he has outlived his talents.
'We are all industrious,' the Gran Maestro said.
'In different ways.
'I will go and check on what there actually is among the meats.
'Check carefully.
'I am industrious.
'You are also damn sagacious.
The Gran Maestro was gone and the girl said, 'He is a lovely man and I love how fond he is of you.
'We are good friends,' the Colonel said.
'I hope he has a good steak for you.
'There is one very good steak,' the Gran Maestro said, reappearing.
'You take it, Daughter.
I get them all the time at the mess.
Do you want it rare?'.
'Quite rare, please.
'Al sangue,' the Colonel said, 'as John said when he spoke to the waiter in French.
Crudo, bleu, or just make it very rare.
'It's rare,' the Gran Maestro said.
'And you, my Colonel?'.
'The scaloppine with Marsala, and the cauliflower braised with butter.
Plus an artichoke vinaigrette if you can find one.
What do you want, Daughter?'.
'Mashed potatoes and a plain salad.
'You're a growing girl.
'Yes.
But I should not grow too much nor in the wrong directions.
'I think that handles it,' the Colonel said.
'What about a fiasco of Valpolicella?'.
'We don't have fiascos.
This is a good hotel, you know.
It comes in bottles.
'I forgot,' the Colonel said.
'Do you remember when it cost thirty centesimi the litre?'.
'And we would throw the empty fiascos at the station guards from the troop trains?'.
'And we would throw all the left over grenades away and bounce them down the hillside coming back from the Grappa?'.
'And they would think there was a break-through when they would see the bursts and you never shaved, and we wore the fiamme nere on the grey, open jackets with the grey sweaters?'.
'And I drank grappa and could not even feel the taste?'.
'We must have been tough then,' the Colonel said.
'We were tough then,' the Gran Maestro said.
'We were bad boys then, and you were the worst of the bad boys.
'Yes,' the Colonel said.
'I think we were rather bad boys.
You forgive this will you, Daughter?'.
'You haven't a picture of then, have you?'.
'No.
There weren't any pictures except with Mr.
d'Annunzio in them.
Also most of the people turned out badly.
'Except for us,' the Gran Maestro said.
'Now I must go and see how the steak marches.
The Colonel, who was a sub-lieutenant again now, riding in a camion, his face dust, until only his metallic eyes showed, and they were red-rimmed and sore, sat thinking.
The three key points, he thought.
The massif of Grappa with Assalone and Pertica and the hill I do not remember the name of on the right.
That was where I grew up, he thought, and all the nights I woke sweating, dreaming I would not be able to get them out of the trucks.
They should not have gotten out, ever, of course.
But what a trade it is.
'In our army, you know,' he told the girl, 'practically no generals have ever fought.
It is quite strange and the top organization dislikes those who have fought.
'Do generals really fight?'.
'Oh, yes.
When they are captains and lieutenants.
Later, except in retreats, it is rather stupid.
'Did you fight much? I know you did.
But tell me.
'I fought enough to be classified as a fool by the great thinkers.
'Tell me.
'When I was a boy, I fought against Erwin Rommel half way from Cortina to the Grappa, where we held.
He was a captain then and I was an acting captain; really a sub-lieutenant.
'Did you know him?'.
'No.
Not until after the war when we could talk together.
He was very nice and I liked him.
We used to ski together.
'Did you like many Germans?'.
'Very many.
Ernst Udet I liked the best.
'But they were in the wrong.
'Of course.
But who has not been?'.
'I never could like them or take such a tolerant attitude as you do, since they killed my father and burned our villa on the Brenta and the day I saw a German officer shooting pigeons with a shotgun in the Piazzo San Marco.
'I understand,' the Colonel said.
'But please, Daughter, you try to understand my attitude too.
When we have killed so many we can afford to be kind.
'How many have you killed?'.
'One hundred and twenty-two sures.
Not counting possibles.
'You had no remorse?'.
'Never.
'Nor bad dreams about it?'.
'Nor bad dreams.
But usually strange ones.
Combat dreams, always, for a while after combat.
But then strange dreams about places mostly.
We live by accidents of terrain, you know.
And terrain is what remains in the dreaming part of your mind.
'Don't you ever dream about me?'.
'I try to.
But I can't.
'Maybe the portrait will help.
'I hope so,' the Colonel said.
'Please don't forget to remind me to give back the stones.
'Please don't be cruel.
'I have my small necessities of honour in the same proportions as we have our great and enveloping love.
You cannot have the one without the other.
'But you could give me privileges.
'You have them,' the Colonel said.
'The stones are in my pocket.
The Gran Maestro came then with the steak and the scaloppine and the vegetables.
They were brought by a sleek-headed boy who believed in nothing; but was trying hard to be a good second waiter.
He was a member of the Order.
The Gran Maestro served adroitly and with respect both for the food, and those that were to eat it.
'Now eat,' he said.
'Uncork that Valpolicella,' he said to the boy who had the eyes of an unbelieving spaniel.
'What do you have on that character?' the Colonel asked him, referring to his pitted compatriot, sitting chawing at his food, while the elderly woman with him ate with suburban grace.
'You should tell me.
Not me you.
'I never saw him before to-day,' the Colonel said.
'He's hard to take with food.
'He condescends to me.
He speaks bad Italian assiduously.
He goes everywhere in Baedeker, and he has no taste in either food or wine.
The woman is nice.
I believe she is his aunt.
But I have no real information.
'He looks like something we could do without.
'I believe we could.
In a pinch.
'Does he speak of us?'.
'He asked me who you were.
He was familiar with the Contessa's name and had book-visited several palaces that had belonged to the family.
He was impressed by your name, Madam, which I gave to impress him.
'Do you think he will put us in a book?'.
'I'm sure of it.
He puts everything in a book.
'We ought to be in a book,' the Colonel said.
'Would you mind, Daughter?'.
'Of course not,' the girl said.
'But I'd rather Dante wrote it.
'Dante isn't around,' the Colonel said.
'Can you tell me anything about the war?' the girl asked.
'Anything that I should be permitted to know?'.
'Sure.
Anything you like.
'What was General Eisenhower like?'.
'Strictly the Epworth League.
Probably that is unjust too.
Also complicated by various other influences.
An excellent politician.
Political General.
Very able at it.
'The other leaders?'.
'Let us not name them.
They've named themselves enough in their memoirs.
Mostly extremely plausible out of something called the Rotary Club that you would never have heard of.
In this club, they have enamelled buttons with their first names and you are fined if you call them by their proper names.
Never fought.
Ever.
'Were there no good ones?'.
'Yes, many.
Bradley, the schoolmaster, and many others.
Give you Lightning Joe as a good one.
Very good.
'Who was he?'.
'Commanded the Seventh Corps when I was there.
Very sound.
Rapid.
Accurate.
Now chief of staff.
'But what about the great leaders we heard about like the Generals Montgomery and Patton?'.
'Forget them, Daughter.
Monty was a character who needed fifteen to one to move, and then moved tardily.
'I always supposed he was a great General.
'He was not,' the Colonel said.
'The worst part was he knew it.
I have seen him come into an hotel and change from his proper uniform into a crowd-catching kit to go out in the evening to animate the populace.
'Do you dislike him?'.
'No.
I simply think he is a British General.
Whatever that means.
And don't you use the term.
'But he beat General Rommel.
'Yes.
And you don't think anyone else had softened him up? And who can't win with fifteen to one? When we fought here, when we were boys, the Gran Maestro and I, we won for one whole year with three to four against one and we won each one.
Three main bad ones.
That is why we can make jokes and not be solemn.
We had something over one hundred and forty thousand dead that year.
That is why we can speak gaily and without pomposity.
'It is such a sad science; if it is a science,' the girl said.
'I hate the war monuments, though I respect them.
'I do not like them either.
Nor the process which led to their construction.
Have you ever seen that end of the thing?'.
'No.
But I would like to know.
'Better not know,' the Colonel said.
'Eat your steak before it gets cold and forgive me for talking about my trade.
'I hate it but I love it.
'I believe we share the same emotions,' the Colonel said.
'But what is my pitted compatriot thinking three tables down?'.
'About his next book, or about what it says in Baedeker.
'Should we go and ride in a gondola in the wind after we have dined?'.
'That would be lovely.
'Should we tell the pitted man that we are going? I think he has the same pits on his heart and in his soul and maybe in his curiosity.
'We tell him nothing,' the girl said.
'The Gran Maestro can convey him any information we wish.
Then she chewed well and solidly on her steak and said, 'Do you think it is true that men make their own faces after fifty.
'I hope not.
Because I would not sign for mine.
'You,' she said.
'You.
'Is the steak good?' the Colonel asked.
'It's wonderful.
How are your scaloppine?'.
'Very tender and the sauce is not at all sweet.
Do you like the vegetables?'.
'The cauliflower is almost crisp; like celery.
'We should have some celery.
But I don't think there is any or the Gran Maestro would have brought it.
'Don't we have fun with food? Imagine if we could eat together always.
'I've suggested it.
'Let's not talk about that.
'All right,' the Colonel said.
'I've made a decision too.
I'm going to chuck the army and live in this town, very simply, on my retirement pay.
'That's wonderful.
How do you look in civilian clothes?'.
'You've seen me.
'I know it, my dear.
I said it for a joke.
You make rough jokes sometimes too, you know.
'I'll look all right.
That is if you have a tailor here who can cut clothes.
'There isn't one here, but there is in Rome.
Can we drive together to Rome to get the clothes?'.
'Yes.
And we will live outside the town at Viterbo and only go in for the fittings and for dinner in the evening.
Then we'll drive back in the night.
'Will we see cinema people and speak about them with candour and perhaps not have a drink with them?'.
'We'll see them by the thousands.
'Will we see them being married for the second and third time and then being blessed by the Pope?'.
'If you go in for that kind of thing.
'I don't,' the girl said.
'That's one reason that I cannot marry you.
'I see,' the Colonel said.
'Thank you.
'But I will love you, whatever that means, and you and I know what it means very well, as long as either of us is alive and after.
'I don't think you can love very much after you, yourself, are dead,' the Colonel said.
He started to eat the artichoke taking a leaf at a time, and dipping them, heavy side down, into the deep saucer of sauce vinaigrette.
'I don't know whether you can either,' the girl said.
'But I will try.
Don't you feel better to be loved?'.
'Yes,' the Colonel said.
'I feel as though I were out on some bare-assed hill where it was too rocky to dig, and the rocks all solid, but with nothing jutting, and no bulges, and all of a sudden instead of being there naked, I was armoured.
Armoured and the eighty-eights not there.
'You should tell that to our writer friend with the craters of the moon face so he could write it to-night.
'I ought to tell it to Dante if he was around,' the Colonel, suddenly gone as rough as the sea when a line squall comes up, said.
'I'd tell him what I'd do if I were shifted, or ascended, into an armoured vehicle under such circumstances.
Just then the Barone Alvarito came into the dining-room.
He was looking for them and, being a hunter, he saw them instantly.
He came over to the table and kissed Renata's hand, saying, 'Ciao, Renata.
' He was almost tall, beautifully built in his town clothes, and he was the shyest man the Colonel had ever known.
He was not shy from ignorance, nor from being ill at ease, nor from any defect.
He was basically shy, as certain animals are, such as the Bongo that you will never see in the jungle, and that must be hunted with dogs.
'My Colonel,' he said.
He smiled as only the truly shy can smile.
It was not the easy grin of the confident, nor the quick slashing smile of the extremely durable and the wicked.
It had no relation with the poised, intently used smile of the courtesan or the politician.
It was the strange, rare smile which rises from the deep, dark pit, deeper than a well, deep as a deep mine, that is within them.
'I can only stay a moment.
I came to tell you that it looks quite good for the shoot.
The ducks are coming in heavily from the north.
There are many big ducks.
The ones you like,' he smiled again.
'Sit down, Alvarito.
Please.
'No,' the Barone Alvarito said.
'We can meet at the garage at two-thirty if you like? You have your car?'.
'Yes.
'That makes it very good.
Leaving at that hour, we will have time to see the ducks in the evening.
'Splendid,' the Colonel said.
'Ciao, then, Renata.
Good-bye, my Colonel.
Until two-thirty.
'We knew each other as children,' the girl said.
'But he was about three years older.
He was born very old.
'Yes.
I know.
He is a good friend of mine.
'Do you think your compatriot has looked him up in Baedeker?'.
'I wouldn't know,' the Colonel said.
'Gran Maestro,' he asked, 'did my illustrious compatriot look up the Barone in Baedeker?'.
'Truly, my Colonel.
I have not seen him pull his Baedeker during the meal.
'Give him full marks,' the Colonel said.
'Now look.
I believe that the Valpolicella is better when it is newer.
It is not a grand vin and bottling it and putting years on it only adds sediment.
Do you agree?'.
'I agree.
'Then what should we do?'.
'My Colonel, you know that in a Great Hotel, wine must cost money.
You cannot get Pinard at the Ritz.
But I suggest that we get several fiascos of the good.
You can say they come from the Contessa Renata's estates and are a gift.
Then I will have them decanted for you.
This way, we will have better wine and make an impressive saving.
I will explain it to the manager if you like.
He is a very good man.
'Explain it to him,' the Colonel said.
'He's not a man who drinks labels either.
'Agreed.
'In the meantime you might as well drink this.
It is very good you know.
'It is,' the Colonel said.
'But it isn't Chambertin.
'What did we use to drink?'.
'Anything,' the Colonel said.
'But now I seek perfection.
Or, rather, not absolute perfection, but perfection for my money.
'I seek it, too,' the Gran Maestro said.
'But rather vainly.
'What do you want for the end of the meal?'.
'Cheese,' the Colonel said.
'What do you want, Daughter?'.
The girl had been quiet and a little withdrawn, since she had seen Alvarito.
Something was going on in her mind, and it was an excellent mind.
But, momentarily, she was not with them.
'Cheese,' she said.
'Please.
'What cheese?'.
'Bring them all and we'll look at them,' the Colonel said.
The Gran Maestro left and the Colonel said, 'What's the matter, Daughter?'.
'Nothing.
Never anything.
Always nothing.
'You might as well pull out of it.
We haven't time for such luxuries.
'No.
I agree.
We will devote ourselves to the cheese.
'Do I have to take it like a corn cob?'.
'No,' she said, not understanding the colloquialism, but understanding exactly what was meant, since it was she who had been doing the thinking.
'Put your right hand in your pocket.
'Good,' the Colonel said.
'I will.
He put his right hand in his pocket and felt what was there, first with the tips of his fingers, and then with the insides of his fingers, and then with the palm of his hand; his split hand.
'I'm sorry,' she said.
'And now we begin the good part of it again.
We will dedicate ourselves to the cheese with happiness.
'Excellent,' the Colonel said.
'I wonder what cheeses he has?'.
'Tell me about the last war,' the girl said.
'Then we will ride in our gondola in the cold wind.
'It was not very interesting,' the Colonel said.
'To us, of course, such things are always interesting.
But there were only three, maybe four, phases that really interested me.
'Why?'.
'We were fighting a beaten enemy whose communications had been destroyed.
We destroyed many divisions on paper, but they were ghost divisions.
Not real ones.
They had been destroyed by our tactical aviation before they ever got up.
It was only really difficult in Normandy, due to the terrain, and when we made the break for Georgie Patton's armour to go through and held it open on both sides.
'How do you make a break for armour to go through? Tell me, please.
'First you fight to take a town that controls all the main roads.
Call the town St.
Then you have to open up the roads by taking other towns and villages.
The enemy has a main line of resistance, but he cannot bring up his divisions to counter-attack because the fighter-bombers catch them on the roads.
Does this bore you? It bores the hell out of me.
'It does not bore me.
I never heard it said understandably before.
'Thank you,' the Colonel said.
'Are you sure you want more of the sad science?'.
'Please,' she said.
'I love you, you know, and I would like to share it with you.
'Nobody shares this trade with anybody,' the Colonel told her.
'I'm just telling you how it works.
I can insert anecdotes to make it interesting, or plausible.
'Insert some, please.
'The taking of Paris was nothing,' the Colonel said.
'It was only an emotional experience.
Not a military operation.
We killed a number of typists and the screen the Germans had left, as they always do, to cover their withdrawal.
I suppose they figured they were not going to need a hell of a lot of office workers any more and they left them as soldiers.
'Was it not a great thing?'.
'The people of Leclerc, another jerk of the third or fourth water, whose death I celebrated with a magnum of Perrier-Jouet Brut 1942, shot a great number of rounds to make it seem important and because we had given them what they had to shoot with.
But it was not important.
'Did you take part in it?'.
'Yes,' the Colonel said.
'I think I could safely say, yes.
'Did you have no great impressions of it? After all, it was Paris and not everyone has taken it.
'The French, themselves, had taken it four days before.
But the grand plan of what we called SHAEF, Supreme, get that word, Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, which included all the military politicians of the rear, and who wore a badge of shame in the form of a flaming something, while we wore a four-leafed clover as a designation, and for luck, had a master plan for the envelopment of the city.
So we could not simply take it.
'Also we had to wait for the possible arrival of General or Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery who was unable to close, even, the gap at Falaise and found the going rather sticky and could not quite get there on time.
'You must have missed him,' the girl said.
'Oh, we did,' the Colonel said.
'No end.
'But was there nothing noble or truly happy about it?'.
'Surely,' the Colonel told her.
'We fought from Bas Meudon, and then the Porte de Saint Cloud, through streets I knew and loved and we had no deads and did as little damage as possible.
At the Etoile I took Elsa Maxwell's butler prisoner.
It was a very complicated operation.
He had been denounced as a Japanese sniper.
A new thing.
Several Parisians were alleged to have been killed by him.
So we sent three men to the roof where he had taken refuge and he was an Indo-China boy.
'I begin to understand a little.
But it is disheartening.
'It is always disheartening as hell.
But you are not supposed to have a heart in this trade.
'But do you think it was the same in the time of the Grand Captains?'.
'I am quite sure it was worse.
'But you got your hand honourably?'.
'Yes.
Very honourably.
On a rocky, bare-assed hill.
'Please let me feel it,' she said.
'Just be careful around the centre,' the Colonel said.
'It's split there and it still cracks open.
'You ought to write,' the girl said.
'I mean it truly.
So someone would know about such things.
'No,' the Colonel disagreed.
'I have not the talent for it and I know too much.
Almost any liar writes more convincingly than a man who was there.
'But other soldiers wrote.
'Yes.
Maurice de Saxe.
Frederick the Great.
T'sun Su.
'But soldiers of our time.
'You use the word our with facility.
I like it though.
'But didn't many modern soldiers write?'.
'Many.
But did you ever read them?'.
'No.
I have read mostly the classics and I read the illustrated papers for the scandals.
Also, I read your letters.
'Burn them,' the Colonel said.
'They are worthless.
'Please.
Don't be rough.
'I won't.
What can I tell you that won't bore you?'.
'Tell me about when you were a General.
'Oh, that,' he said and motioned to the Gran Maestro to bring champagne.
It was Roederer Brut '42 and he loved it.
'When you are a General you live in a trailer and your Chief of Staff lives in a trailer, and you have bourbon whisky when other people do not have it.
Your Gs live in the C.
I'd tell you what Gs are, but it would bore you.
I'd tell you about G1, G2, G3, G4, G5 and on the other side there is always Kraut-6.
But it would bore you.
On the other hand, you have a map covered with plastic material, and on this you have three regiments composed of three battalions each.
It is all marked in coloured pencil.
'You have boundary lines so that when the battalions cross their boundaries they will not then fight each other.
Each battalion is composed of five companies.
All should be good, but some are good, and some are not so good.
Also you have divisional artillery and a battalion of tanks and many spare parts.
You live by co-ordinates.
He paused while the Gran Maestro poured the Roederer Brut '42.
'From Corps,' he translated, unlovingly, cuerpo d'Armata, 'they tell you what you must do, and then you decide how to do it.
You dictate the orders or, most often, you give them by telephone.
You ream out people you respect, to make them do what you know is fairly impossible, but is ordered.
Also, you have to think hard, stay awake late and get up early.
'And you won't write about this? Not even to please me?'.
'No,' said the Colonel.
'Boys who were sensitive and cracked and kept all their valid first impressions of their day of battle, or their three days, or even their four, write books.
They are good books but can be dull if you have been there.
Then others write to profit quickly from the war they never fought in.
The ones who ran back to tell the news.
The news is hardly exact.
But they ran quickly with it.
Professional writers who had jobs that prevented them from fighting wrote of combat that they could not understand, as though they had been there.
I do not know what category of sin that comes under.
'Also a nylon-smooth captain of the Navy who could not command a cat-boat wrote about the intimate side of the truly Big Picture.
Everybody will write their book sooner or later.
We might even draw a good one.
But I don't write, Daughter.
He motioned for the Gran Maestro to fill the glasses.
'Gran Maestro,' he said.
'Do you like to fight?'.
'No.
'But we fought?'.
'Yes.
Too much.
'How is your health?'.
'Wonderful except for the ulcers and a small cardiac condition.
'No,' the Colonel said, and his heart rose and he felt it choke him.
'You only told me about the ulcers.
'Well, you know now,' the Gran Maestro said and did not finish the sentence and he smiled his best and clearest smile that came as solid as the sun rises.
'How many times?'.
The Gran Maestro held up two fingers as a man might do giving odds where he had credit, and all the betting was on the nod.
'I'm ahead of you,' the Colonel said.
'But let's not be macabre.
Ask Donna Renata if she wishes more of this excellent wine.
'You did not tell me there were more,' the girl said.
'You owe it to me to tell me.
'There has been nothing since we were together last.
'Do you think it breaks for me? If so, I would come and simply be with you and care for you.
'It's just a muscle,' the Colonel said.
'Only it is the main muscle.
It works as perfectly as a Rolex Oyster Perpetual.
The trouble is you cannot send it to the Rolex representative when it goes wrong.
When it stops, you just do not know the time.
You're dead.
'Don't please talk about it.
'You asked me,' the Colonel said.
'And that pitted man with the caricature face? He has no such thing?'.
'Of course not,' the Colonel told her.
'If he is a mediocre writer he will live for ever.
'But you're not a writer.
How do you know this?'.
'No,' the Colonel said.
'By the grace of God.
But I've read several books.
We have a lot of time to read when we are unmarried.
Not as much as the merchant marine maybe.
But plenty.
I can tell one writer from another and I tell you that a mediocre writer has a long span of life.
They ought to all draw longevity pay.
'Could you tell me any anecdotes, and we stop talking about this, which is my true sorrow?'.
'I can tell you hundreds of them.
All true.
'Tell me just one.
Then we will finish this wine and then go in the gondola.
'Do you think you will be warm enough?'.
'Oh, I'm sure I will.
'I don't know what to tell you,' the Colonel said.
'Everything about war bores those who have not made it.
Except the tales of the liars.
'I would like to know about the taking of Paris.
'Why? Because I told you that you looked like Marie Antoinette in the tumbril?'.
'No.
I was complimented by that and I know we are a little alike in profile.
But I have never been in any tumbril, and I would like to hear about Paris.
When you love someone and he is your hero, you like to hear about the places and the things.
'Please turn your head,' the Colonel said, 'and I will tell you.
Gran Maestro is there any more in that wretched bottle?'.
'No,' the Gran Maestro answered.
'Then bring another.
'I have one already iced.
'Good.
Serve it.
Now, Daughter, we parted from the column of the General Leclerc at Clamart.
They went to Montrouge and the Porte d'Orleans and we went directly to Bas Meudon and secured the bridge of the Porte de Saint Cloud.
Is this too technical and does it bore you?'.
'No.
'It would be better with a map.
'Go on.
'We secured the bridge and established a bridgehead on the other side of the river and we threw the Germans, living and dead, who had defended the bridge, into the Seine River,' he stopped.
'It was a token defence of course.
They should have blown it.
We threw all these Germans into the River Seine.
They were nearly all office workers, I believe.
'Go on.
'The next morning, we were informed that the Germans had strong points at various places, and artillery on Mount Valerien, and that tanks were roaming the streets.
A portion of this was true.
We were also requested not to enter too rapidly as the General Leclerc was to take the city.
I complied with this request and entered as slowly as I could.
'How do you do that?'.
'You hold up your attack two hours and you drink champagne whenever it is offered to you by patriots, collaborators or enthusiasts.
'But was there nothing wonderful nor great, the way it is in books?'.
'Of course.
There was the city itself.
The people were very happy.
Old general officers were walking about in their moth-balled uniforms.
We were very happy, too, not to have to fight.
'Did you not have to fight at all?'.
'Only three times.
Then not seriously.
'But was that all you had to fight to take such a city?'.
'Daughter, we fought twelve times from Ranbouillet to enter the city.
But only two of them were worth describing as fights.
Those at Toussus le Noble and at Le Buc.
The rest was the necessary garnishing of a dish.
I really did not need to fight at all except at those two places.
'Tell me some true things about fighting.
'Tell me you love me.
'I love you,' the girl said.
'You can publish it in the Gazzettina if you like.
I love your hard, flat body and your strange eyes that frighten me when they become wicked.
I love your hand and all your other wounded places.
'I better try to tell you something pretty good,' the Colonel said.
'First I can tell you that I love you, Period.
'Why don't you buy some good glass?' the girl asked, suddenly.
'We could go to Murano together.
'I don't know anything about glass.
'I could teach you.
It would be fun.
'We lead too nomadic a life for good glass.
'But when you retire and live here.
'We'll get some then.
'I wish that that was now.
'So do I, except that I go duck shooting to-morrow and that to-night is to-night.
'Can I come duck shooting?'.
'Only if Alvarito asks you.
'I can make him ask me.
'I doubt that.
'It isn't polite to doubt what your daughter says when she is old enough not to lie.
'All right, Daughter.
I withdraw the doubt.
'Thank you.
For that I will not go and be a nuisance.
I will stay in Venice and go to Mass with Mother and my aunt and my great-aunt and visit my poors.
I am an only child so I have many duties.
'I always wondered what you did.
'That's what I do.
Also, I'll have my maid wash my head and give me a manicure and a pedicure.
'You can't do that because the shoot is on Sunday.
'Then I'll do that on Monday.
On Sunday, I will read all the illustrated papers including the outrageous ones.
'Maybe they'll have pictures of Miss Bergman.
Do you still want to be like her?'.
'Not any more,' the girl said.
'I want to be like me only much, much better and I want to have you love me.
'Also,' she said suddenly and un-maskingly, 'I want to be like you.
Can I be like you a little while to-night?'.
'Of course,' the Colonel said.
'In what town are we anyway?'.
'Venice,' she said.
'The best town, I think.
'I quite agree.
And thank you for not asking me for more war episodes.
'Oh, you are going to have to tell them to me later.
'Have to?' the Colonel said, and the cruelty and resolution showed in his strange eyes as clearly as when the hooded muzzle of the gun of a tank swings towards you.
'Did you say have to, Daughter?'.
'I said it.
But I did not mean it in that way.
Or, if I did wrong, I am sorry.
I meant will you please tell me more true episodes later? And explain me the things I do not understand?'.
'You can use have to if you want, Daughter.
The hell with it.
He smiled and his eyes were as kind as they ever were, which was not too kind, as he knew.
But there was nothing now that he could do about it except to try to be kind to his last and true and only love.
'I don't really mind, Daughter.
Please believe me.
I know about command and, at your age, I used to take considerable pleasure in exercising it.
'But I don't want to command,' the girl said.
In spite of her resolution not to cry, her eyes were wet.
'I wish to serve you.
'I know.
But you wish to command, too.
There's nothing wrong in that.
All people such as us have it.
'Thank you for the such as us.
'It wasn't hard to say,' the Colonel said.
'Daughter,' he added.
Just then the concierge came to the table and said, 'Excuse me, my Colonel.
There is a man outside, I believe he is a servant of yours, my lady, with quite a large package which he says is for the Colonel.
Should I keep it in the storeroom or have it sent to your room?'.
'To my room,' the Colonel said.
'Please,' the girl said.
'Can't we look at it here? We don't care about anyone here, do we?'.
'Have it unwrapped and brought in here.
'Very good.
'Later, you may have it taken with great care to my room and have it wrapped, solidly, for transport at noon to-morrow.
'Very good, my Colonel.
'Are you excited to see it?' the girl asked.
'Very,' said the Colonel.
'Gran Maestro, some more of that Roederer, please, and please place a chair in such a position that we may view a portrait.
We are devotees of the pictorial arts.
'There's no more Roederer cold,' the Gran Maestro said.
'But if you would like some Perrier-Jouet——'.
'Bring it,' the Colonel said and added, 'Please.
'I don't talk like Georgie Patton,' the Colonel told her.
'I don't have to.
And besides he's dead.
'Poor man.
'Yes.
Poor man all his life.
Although quite rich in money and with a lot of armour.
'Do you have anything against armour?'.
'Yes.
Most of the people inside of it.
It makes men into bullies which is the first step towards cowardice; true cowardice, I mean.
Perhaps it is a little complicated by claustrophobia.
Then he looked at her and smiled and regretted taking her beyond her depth, as you might take a new swimmer on a shallow, shelving beach, into too deep water; and he sought to reassure her.
'You forgive me, Daughter.
Much of what I say is unjust.
But it is truer than the things that you will read in Generals' memoirs.
After a man gets one star, or more, the truth becomes as difficult for him to attain as the Holy Grail was in our ancestors' time.
'But you were a general officer.
'Not for too damn long,' the Colonel said.
'Now captains,' the General said, 'they know the exact truth and they can mostly tell it to you.
If they can't, you reclassify them.
'Would you reclassify me if I lied?'.
'It would depend on what you lied about.
'I'm not going to lie about anything.
I don't want to be reclassified.
It sounds horrible.
'It is,' the Colonel said.
'And you send them back to have it done to them with eleven different copies of why it should be done, every one of which you sign.
'Did you reclassify many?'.
'Plenty.
The concierge came into the room with the portrait, carrying it in its big frame, much as a ship moves when she is carrying too much sail.
'Get two chairs,' the Colonel said to the second waiter, 'and put them there.
See that the canvas does not touch the chairs.
And hold it so it does not slip.
Then to the girl he said, 'We'll have to change that frame.
'I know,' she said.
'It was not my choice.
Take it unframed with you and we'll choose a good frame next week.
Now look at it.
Not at the frame.
At what it says, or does not say, of me.
It was a beautiful portrait; neither cold, nor snobbish, nor stylized, nor modern.
It was the way you would want your girl painted if Tintoretto were still around and, if he were not around, you settled for Velasquez.
It was not the way either of them painted.
It was simply a splendid portrait painted, as they sometimes are, in our time.
'It's wonderful,' the Colonel said.
'It is truly lovely.
The concierge and the second waiter were holding it and looking at it around the edges.
The Gran Maestro was admiring fully.
The American, two tables down, was looking at it with his journalistic eyes, wondering who painted it.
The back of the canvas was to the other diners.
'It is wonderful,' the Colonel said.
'But you can't give me that.
'I already have,' the girl said.
'I'm sure my hair was never that long over my shoulders.
'I think it probably was.
'I could try to let it get that long if you want.
'Try,' the Colonel said.
'You great beauty you.
I love you very much.
You and you portrayed on canvas.
'Tell the waiters if you like.
I'm sure it won't come as a great shock to them.
'Take the canvas upstairs to my room,' the Colonel said to the concierge.
'Thank you very much for bringing it in.
If the price is right, I am going to buy it.
'The price is right,' the girl said to him.
'Should we have them take it and the chairs down and make a special showing of it for your compatriot? The Gran Maestro could tell him the address of the painter and he could visit the picturesque studio.
'It is a very lovely portrait,' the Gran Maestro said.
'But it should be taken to the room.
One should never let Roederer or Perrier-Jouet do the talking.
'Take it to the room, please.
'You said please without a pause before it.
'Thank you,' the Colonel said.
'I am very deeply moved by the portrait and I am not entirely responsible for what I say.
'Let's neither of us be responsible.
'Agreed,' the Colonel said.
'The Gran Maestro is really very responsible.
He always was.
'No,' the girl said.
'I think he did not only from responsibility but from malice.
We all have malice, you know, of some kind or another in this town.
I think perhaps he did not want the man to have even a journalist's look into happiness.
'Whatever that is.
'I learned that phrase from you and now you have re-learned it back from me.
'That's the way it goes,' the Colonel said.
'What you win in Boston you lose in Chicago.
'I don't understand that at all.
'Too hard to explain,' the Colonel said.
Then, 'No.
Of course it isn't.
Making things clear is my main trade.
The hell with being too hard to explain.
It is like professional football, calcio.
What you win in Milano you lose in Torino.
'I don't care about football.
'Neither do I,' the Colonel said.
'Especially not about the Army and Navy game and when the very high brass speaks in terms of American football so they can understand, themselves, what they are talking of.
'I think we will have a good time to-night.
Even under the circumstances, whatever they are.
'Should we take this new bottle in the gondola?'.
'Yes,' the girl said.
'But with deep glasses.
I'll tell the Gran Maestro.
Let's get our coats and go.
'Good.
I'll take some of this medicine and sign for the G.
and we'll go.
'I wish it was me taking the medicine instead of you.
'I'm glad as hell it isn't,' the Colonel said.
'Should we pick our gondola or have them bring one to the landing?'.
'Let's gamble and have them bring one to the landing.
What do we have to lose?'.
'Nothing, I guess.
Probably nothing.
Chapter XIII.
They went out the side door of the hotel to the imbarcadero and the wind hit them.
The light from the hotel shone on the blackness of the gondola and made the water green.
She looks as lovely as a good horse or as a racing shell, the Colonel thought.
Why have I never seen a gondola before? What hand or eye framed that darked symmetry?.
'Where should we go?' the girl asked.
Her hair, in the light from the hotel door and window, as she stood on the dock by the black gondola, was blowing back in the wind, so she looked like the figure-head on a ship.
The rest of it, too, the Colonel thought.
'Let's just ride through the park,' the Colonel said.
'Or through the Bois with the top down.
Let him take us out to Armenonville.
'Will we go to Paris?'.
'Sure,' the Colonel said.
'Tell him to take us for an hour where the going is easiest.
I don't want to drive him into that wind.
'The tide is quite high with this wind,' the girl said.
'Some of our places he couldn't get under the bridges.
May I tell him where to go?'.
'Of course, Daughter.
'Stow that ice bucket aboard,' the Colonel said to the second waiter, who had come out with them.
'The Gran Maestro said to tell you, as you embarked, that this bottle of wine was his present.
'Thank him properly and tell him he can't do that.
'He had better go into the wind a little first,' the girl said.
'Then I know how he should go.
'The Gran Maestro sent this,' the second waiter said.
It was a folded, old U.
blanket.
Renata was talking to the gondoliere, her hair blowing.
The gondoliere wore a heavy blue navy sweater and he was bare-headed too.
'Thank him,' the Colonel said.
He slipped a bill into the second waiter's hand.
The second waiter returned it.
'You already made the notation on the check.
Neither you nor I nor the Gran Maestro are starving.
'What about the moglie and the bambini?'.
'I don't have that.
Your mediums smacked our house in Treviso.
'I'm sorry.
'You needn't be,' the second waiter said.
'You were a foot soldier as I was.
'Permit me to be sorry.
'Sure,' the second waiter said.
'And what the hell difference does it make? Be happy, my Colonel and be happy, my Lady.
They got down into the gondola and there was the same magic, as always, of the light hull and the sudden displacement that you made and then the trimming in the dark privacy and then the second trimming, as the gondoliere started to scull, laying her partly on her side so that he would have more control.
'Now,' the girl said.
'We are in our home and I love you.
Please kiss me and put all love into it.
The Colonel held her close, with her head thrown back and kissed her until there was nothing left of the kiss but desperation.
'I love you.
'Whatever that means,' she interrupted.
'I love you and I know whatever that means.
The picture is lovely.
But there is no word for what you are.
'Wild,' she said.
'Or careless or unkempt?'.
'No.
'The last was one of the first words I learned from my governess.
It means you do not comb your hair enough.
Neglectful is when you do not brush one hundred strokes at night.
'I'm going to run my hand through it and make it unkempter still.
'Your hurt hand?'.
'Yes.
'We're sitting on the wrong sides for that.
Change over.
'Good.
That is a sensible order couched in simple language and easily understood.
It was fun moving over, trying not to disturb the balance of the gondola, but having to trim again carefully.
'Now,' she said.
'But hold me tightly with the other arm.
'You know just what you want?'.
'I do indeed.
Is it un-maidenly? I learned that word, too, from my governess.
'No,' he said.
'It's lovely.
Pull up the blanket good and feel that wind.
'It's from the high mountains.
'Yes.
And beyond there it's from somewhere else.
The Colonel heard the slap of the waves and he felt the wind come sharply and the rough familiarity of the blanket and then he felt the girl cold-warm and lovely and with upraised breasts that his left hand coasted lightly over.
Then he ran his bad hand through her hair once, twice and three times and then he kissed her and it was worse than desperation.
'Please,' she said, from almost underneath the blanket.
'Let me kiss now.
'No,' he said.
'Me again.
The wind was very cold and lashed their faces but under the blanket there was no wind nor nothing; only his ruined hand that searched for the island in the great river with the high steep banks.
'That's it,' she said.
He kissed her then and he searched for the island, finding it and losing it and then finding it for good.
For good and for bad, he thought and for good and for all.
'My darling,' he said.
'My well beloved.
Please.
'No.
Just hold me very tight and hold the high ground, too.
The Colonel said nothing, because he was assisting, or had made an act of presence, at the only mystery that he believed in except the occasional bravery of man.
'Please don't move,' the girl said.
'Then move a great amount.
The Colonel, lying under the blanket in the wind, knowing it is only what man does for woman that he retains; except what he does for his fatherland or his motherland, however you get the reading, proceeded.
'Please, darling,' the girl said.
'I don't think I can stand it.
'Don't think of anything.
Don't think of anything at all.
'I'm not.
'Don't think.
'Oh please let's not talk.
'Is it right?'.
'You know.
'You're sure.
'Oh please not talk.
Please.
Yes, he thought.
Please and please again.
She said nothing and neither did he, and when the great bird had flown far out of the closed window of the gondola and was lost and gone, neither of them said anything.
He held her head lightly with his good arm and the other arm held the high ground now.
'Please put it where it should be,' she said.
'Your hand.
'Should we?'.
'No.
Just hold me tight and try to love me true.
'I love you true,' he said and just then the gondola turned to the left, quite sharply and the wind was on his right cheek and he said, with his old eyes catching the outline of the Palace where they turned and noting it, 'You're in the lee now, Daughter.
'But it is too soon now.
Don't you know how a woman feels?'.
'No.
Only what you tell me.
'Thank you for the you.
But don't you really know?'.
'No.
I never asked, I guess.
'Guess now,' she said.
'And please wait until after we have gone under the second bridge.
'Take a glass of this,' the Colonel said, reaching accurately and well for the champagne bucket with the ice and uncorking the bottle the Gran Maestro had uncorked and then placed a common wine cork in.
'This is good for you, Daughter.
It is good for all the ills that all of us have and for all sadness and indecision.
'I have none of those,' she said, speaking grammatically as her governess had taught her.
'I am just a woman, or a girl, or whatever that is, doing whatever it is she should not do.
Let's do it again, please, now I am in the lee.
'Where is the island now and in what river?'.
'You are making the discovery.
I am only the unknown country.
'Not too unknown,' the Colonel said.
'Please don't be rude,' the girl said.
'And please attack gently and with the same attack as before.
'It's no attack,' the Colonel said.
'It is something else.
'Whatever it is, whatever it is, while I'm still in the lee.
'Yes,' the Colonel said.
'Yes, now if you want, or will accept from kindness.
'Please, yes.
She talks like a gentle cat, though the poor cats cannot speak, the Colonel thought.
But then he stopped thinking and he did not think for a long time.
The gondola now was in one of the secondary canals.
When it had turned from the Grand Canal, the wind had swung it so the gondoliere had to shift all his weight as ballast and the Colonel and the girl had shifted too, under the blanket, with the wind getting under the edge of the blanket; wildly.
They had not spoken for a long time and the Colonel had noted that the gondola had only inches free in passing under the last bridge.
'How are you, Daughter?'.
'I'm quite lovely.
'Do you love me?'.
'Please don't ask such silly things.
'The tide is very high and we only just made that last bridge.
'I think I know where we are going.
I was born here.
'I've made mistakes in my home town,' the Colonel said.
'Being born there isn't everything.
'It is very much,' the girl said.
'You know that.
Please hold me very tightly so we can be a part of each other for a little while.
'We can try,' the Colonel said.
'Couldn't I be you?'.
'That's awfully complicated.
We could try of course.
'I'm you now,' she said.
'And I just took the city of Paris.
'Jesus, Daughter,' he said.
'You've got an awful lot of problems on your hands.
The next thing, they will parade the twenty-eighth division through.
'I don't care.
'I do.
'Were they not good?'.
'Sure.
They had fine commanders, too.
But they were National Guard and hard luck.
What you call a T.
division.
Get your T.
slip from the chaplain.
'I understand none of those things.
'They aren't worth explaining,' the Colonel said.
'Will you tell me some true things about Paris? I love it so much and when I think of you taking it, then, it is as though I were riding in this gondola with Marechal Ney.
'A no good job,' the Colonel said.
'Anyway, not after he fought all those rear-guard actions coming back from that big Russian town.
He used to fight ten, twelve, fifteen times a day.
Maybe more.
Afterwards, he couldn't recognize people.
Please don't get in any gondolas with him.
'He was always one of my great heroes.
'Yeah.
Mine too.
Until Quatre Bras.
Maybe it wasn't Quatre Bras.
I'm getting rusty.
Give it the generic title of Waterloo.
'Was he bad there?'.
'Awful,' the Colonel told her.
'Forget it.
Too many rear-guard actions coming back from Moskova.
'But they called him the bravest of the brave.
'You can't eat on that.
You have to be that, always, and then be the smartest of the smart.
Then you need a lot of stuff coming up.
'Tell me about Paris, please.
We should not make more love, I know.
'I don't know it.
Who says it?'.
'I say it because I love you.
'All right.
You said it and you love me.
So we act on that.
The hell with it.
'Do you think we could once more if it would not hurt you?'.
'Hurt me?' the Colonel said.
'When the hell was I ever hurt?'.
Chapter XIV.
'Please don't be bad,' she said, pulling the blanket over them both.
'Please drink a glass of this with me.
You know you've been hurt.
'Exactly,' the Colonel said.
'Let's forget it.
'All right,' she said.
'I learned that word, or those two words from you.
We have forgotten it.
'Why do you like the hand?' the Colonel asked, placing it where he should.
'Please don't pretend to be stupid and please let's not think of anything, or anything, or anything.
'I am stupid,' the Colonel said.
'But I won't think of anything or anything nor of nothing nor of his brother, to-morrow.
'Please be good and kind.
'I will be.
And I will tell you, now, a military secret.
Top Secret equals British Most Secret.
I love you.
'That's nice,' she said.
'And you put it nicely.
'I'm nice,' the Colonel said and checked on the bridge that was coming up and saw there was clearance.
'That's the first thing people notice about me.
'I always use the wrong words,' the girl said.
'Please just love me.
I wish it was me who could love you.
'You do.
'Yes, I do,' she said.
'With all my heart.
They were going with the wind now and they were both tired.
'Do you think——'.
'I don't think,' the girl said.
'Well try and think.
'I will.
'Drink a glass of this.
'Why not? It's very good.
It was.
There was still ice in the bucket and the wine was cold and clear.
'Can I stay at the Gritti?'.
'No.
'Why not?'.
'It wouldn't be right.
For them.
Nor you.
The hell with me.
'Then I suppose I should go home.
'Yes,' the Colonel said.
'That is the logical supposition.
'That is an awful way to say a sad thing.
Can't we even pretend some things?'.
'No.
I'll take you home and you sleep good and well and to-morrow we will meet where and when you say.
'May I call the Gritti?'.
'Of course.
I'll always be awake.
Will you call when you are awake?'.
'Yes.
But why do you always wake so early?'.
'It is a business habit.
'Oh, I wish you were not in that business and that you were not going to die.
'So do I,' said the Colonel.
'But I'm getting out of the business.
'Yes,' she said, sleepily and comfortably.
'Then we go to Rome and get the clothes.
'And live happily ever after.
'Please don't,' she said.
'Please, please, don't.
You know I made the resolution not to cry.
'You're crying now,' the Colonel said.
'What the hell have you got to lose on that resolution?'.
'Take me home, please.
'That's what I was doing in the first place,' the Colonel told her.
'Be kind once first.
'I will,' the Colonel said.
After they, or the Colonel, rather, had paid the gondoliere who was unknowing, yet knowing all; solid, sound, respectful and trustworthy; they walked into the Piazzetta and then across the great, cold, wind-swept square that was hard and old under their feet.
They walked holding close and hard in their sorrow and their happiness.
'This is the place where the German shot the pigeons,' the girl said.
'We probably killed him,' the Colonel said.
'Or his brother.
Maybe we hanged him.
I wouldn't know.
I'm not in C.
'Do you love me still on these water-worn, cold and old stones?'.
'Yes.
I'd like to spread a bed roll here and prove it.
'That would be more barbarous than the pigeon shooter.
'I'm barbarous,' the Colonel said.
'Not always.
'Thank you for the not always.
'We turn here.
'I think I know that.
When are they going to tear that damned Cinema Palace down and put up a real cathedral? That's what T5 Jackson wants.
'When someone brings Saint Mark back another time under a load of pork from Alexandria.
'That was a Torcello boy.
'You're a Torcello boy.
'Yes.
I'm a Basso Piave boy and a Grappa boy straight here from Pertica.
I'm a Pasubio boy, too, if you know what that means.
It was worse just to live there than to fight anywhere else.
In the platoon they used to share anyone's gonococci brought from Schio and carried in a match-box.
They used to share this just so they could leave because it was intolerable.
'But you stayed.
'Sure,' the Colonel said.
'I'm always the last man to leave the party, fiesta I mean, not as in political party.
The truly unpopular guest.
'Should we go?'.
'I thought you had made up your mind.
'I had.
But when you said it about unpopular guest it was unmade.
'Keep it made up.
'I can hold a decision.
'I know.
You can hold any damn thing.
But, Daughter, sometimes you don't just hold.
That is for stupids.
Sometimes you have to switch fast.
'I'll switch if you like.
'No.
I think the decision was sound.
'But won't it be an awfully long time until morning?'.
'That all depends on whether one has luck or not.
'I should sleep well.
'Yes,' the Colonel said.
'At your age if you can't sleep they ought to take you out and hang you.
'Oh please.
'Sorry,' he said.
'I meant shoot you.
'We are nearly home and you could be kind now if you wanted.
'I'm so kind I stink.
Let somebody else be kind.
They were in front of the palace now and there it was; the palace.
There was nothing to do now but pull the bell cord, or enter with the key.
I've been lost in this place, the Colonel thought, and I was never lost in my life.
'Please kiss me good night, kindly.
The Colonel did and loved her so he could not bear it.
She opened the door with the key, which was in her bag.
Then she was gone and the Colonel was alone, with the worn pavement, the wind, which still held in the north and the shadows from where a light went on.
He walked home.
Only tourists and lovers take gondolas, he thought.
Except to cross the canal in the places where there are no bridges.
I ought to go to Harry's, probably, or some damn place.
But I think I'll go home.
Chapter XV.
It was really home, if a hotel room can be so described.
His pyjamas were laid on the bed.
There was a bottle of Valpolicella by the reading light and by the bed a bottle of mineral water, in an ice bucket with a glass beside it on the silver tray.
The portrait had been deframed and was placed on two chairs where he could see it from the bed.
The Paris edition of the New York Herald Tribune lay on the bed beside his three pillows.
He used three pillows, as Amaldo knew, and his extra bottle of medicine, not the one that he carried in his pocket, was beside the reading light.
The inner doors of the armoire, the mirrored ones, were opened in such a way that he could see the portrait from the side.
His scuffed slippers were by the bed.
I'll buy it, the Colonel said, to himself, since there was no one else there except the portrait.
He opened the Valpolicella which had been uncorked, and then re-corked, carefully, precisely and lovingly and poured himself a glass into the glass which was much better than any hotel should use which was faced with breakage.
'Here's to you, Daughter,' he said.
'You beauty and lovely.
Do you know, that, among other things, you smell good always? You smell wonderfully even in a high wind or under a blanket or kissing good night.
You know almost no one does and you don't use scent.
She looked at him from the portrait and said nothing.
'The hell with it,' he said.
'I'm not going to talk to a picture.
What do you think went wrong to-night? he thought.
Me, I guess.
Well I will try to be a good boy to-morrow all day; starting at first light.
'Daughter,' he said, and he was talking to her and not to a picture now.
'Please know I love you and that I wish to be delicate and good.
And please stay with me always now.
The picture was the same.
The Colonel took out the emeralds from his pocket and looked at them, feeling them slide, cold and yet warm, as they take warmth and as all good stones have warmth, from his bad hand into his good hand.
I should have put these in an envelope and locked them up, he thought.
But what the —— security is there better than I can give them? I have to get these back to you fast, Daughter.
It was fun, though.
And they're not worth more than a quarter of a million.
What I would make in four hundred years.
Have to check that figure.
He put the stones in the pocket of his pyjamas and put a handkerchief over them.
Then he buttoned the pocket.
The first sound thing you learn, he thought, is to have flaps and buttons on all your pockets.
I imagine that I learned it too early.
The stones felt good.
They were hard and warm against his flat, hard, old and warm chest, and he noted how the wind was blowing, looked at the portrait, poured another glass of Valpolicella and then started to read the Paris edition of the New York Herald Tribune.
I ought to take the pills, he thought.
But the hell with the pills.
Then he took them just the same and went on reading the New York Herald.
He was reading Red Smith and he liked him very much.
Chapter XVI.
The colonel woke before daylight and checked that there was no one sleeping with him.
The wind was still blowing hard and he went to the open windows to check the weather.
There was no light as yet in the east across the Grand Canal, but his eyes could see how rough the water was.
Be a hell of a tide to-day, he thought.
Probably flood the square.
That's always fun.
Except for the pigeons.
He went to the bathroom, taking the Herald Tribune and Red Smith with him, as well as a glass of Valpolicella.
Damn I'll be glad when the Gran Maestro gets those big fiascos, he thought.
This wine gets awfully dreggy at the end.
He sat there, with his newspaper, thinking of the things of that day.
There would be the telephone call.
But it might be very late because she would be sleeping late.
The young sleep late, he thought, and the beautiful sleep half again as late.
She certainly would not call early and the shops did not open until nine or a little later.
Hell, he thought, I have these damned stones.
How could anyone do a thing like that?.
You know how, he said to himself, reading the ads.
in the back of the paper.
You've put it on the line enough times.
It isn't crazy or morbid.
She just wanted to put it on the line.
It was a good thing it was me, he thought.
That is the only good thing about being me, he considered.
Well I'm me, God-damn it.
For better or for much worse.
How would you like to sit on the can as you have sat almost every morning of your damned life with this in your pocket?.
He was addressing no one, except, perhaps, posterity.
How many mornings have you sat in the row with all the others? That's the worst of it.
That and shaving.
Or you go off to be alone and think or not think and pick a good piece of cover and there are two riflemen there already, or some boy asleep.
There's no more privacy in the army than in a professional ——.
I've never been in a professional —— but I imagine they run it much the same.
I could learn to run one, he thought.
Then I'd make all my leading —— characters Ambassadors and the unsuccessful ones could be Corps commanders or command military districts in peace time.
Don't be bitter, boy, he said to himself.
It's too early in the morning and your duty's not completed yet.
What would you do with their wives, he asked himself? Buy them new hats or shoot them, he said.
It's all part of the same process.
He looked at himself in the mirror, set in the half-closed door.
It showed him at a slight angle.
It's a deflexion shot, he said to himself and they didn't lead me enough.
Boy, he said, you certainly are a beat-up, old looking bastard.
Now you have to shave and look at that face while you do it.
Then you must get a hair-cut.
That's easy in this town.
You're a Colonel of Infantry, boy.
You can't go around looking like Joan of Arc or General (Breveted) George Armstrong Custer.
That beautiful horse-cavalryman.
I guess it is fun to be that way and have a loving wife and use sawdust for brains.
But it must have seemed like the wrong career to him when they finished up on that hill above the Little Big Horn, with the ponies making the circle around them in all the dust and the sage brush crushed by the hooves of the horses of the other people and nothing left to him for the rest of his life but that old lovely black powder smell and his own people shooting each other and themselves, because they were afraid of what the squaws would do to them.
The body was unspeakably mutilated, they used to put in this same paper.
And on that hill to know you'd made one real mistake, finally and for good and complete with true handles.
Poor horse-cavalryman, he thought.
The end of all his dreams.
That's one good thing about being an Infantryman.
You never have any dreams except bad dreams.
Well, he said to himself, we're finished here and pretty soon there will be good light and I can see the portrait.
I'll be damned if I'll turn that in.
I keep that.
Oh Christ, he said, I wonder what she looks like now sleeping.
I know how she looks, he said to himself.
Wonderful.
She sleeps as though she had not gone to sleep.
As though she were just resting.
I hope she is, he thought.
I hope she's resting well.
Christ Jesus how I love her and I hope I never do her harm.
Chapter XVII.
When it started to be light, the Colonel saw the portrait.
He, very probably, saw it as quickly as any man who was civilized and had to read and sign the forms he did not believe in, could see an object, as soon as it was visible.
Yes, he said to himself, I have eyes and they have fairly fast perception still and once they had ambition.
I have led my Ruffians where they were well peppered.
There are but three of the two hundred and fifty of them left alive and they are for the town's end to beg during life.
That's from Shakespeare, he told the portrait.
The winner and still the undisputed champion.
Someone might take him, in a short bout.
But I would rather revere him.
Did you ever read King Lear, Daughter? Mr.
Gene Tunney did and he was the champion of the world.
But I read it too.
Soldiers care for Mr.
Shakespeare too, though it may seem impossible.
You have anything to say in your defence except to put your head back? he asked the portrait.
You want some more, Shakespeare?.
You don't have to defend.
You just rest and leave it as it is.
It's no good.
Your defence and my defence is no damn good.
But who could tell you to go out and hang yourself the way we do?.
Nobody, he said to himself and to the portrait.
And certainly not me.
He put his good hand down and found that the room waiter had left a second bottle of Valpolicella alongside of where the first had been.
If you love a country, the Colonel thought, you might as well admit it.
Sure, admit it, boy.
I have loved three and lost them thrice.
Give a credit.
We've re-took two.
Retaken, he corrected.
And we will retake the other one, General Fat Ass Franco on his shooting stick with the advice of his doctor and tame ducks and a screen of Moorish cavalry when he shoots.
Yes, he said softly to the girl who looked at him clearly now in the first and best light.
We will retake and they will all be hung upside down outside of filling stations.
You have been warned, he added.
'Portrait,' he said, 'why the hell can't you just get into bed with me instead of being eighteen solid stone blocks away.
Maybe more.
I'm not as sharp now as I was; whenever.
'Portrait,' he said to the girl and to the portrait and to the girl both; but there wasn't any girl and the portrait was as it was painted.
'Portrait, keep your God-damn chin up so you can break my heart easier.
It certainly was a lovely present, the Colonel thought.
'Can you manoeuvre?' he asked the portrait.
'Good and fast?'.
Portrait said nothing and the Colonel answered.
You know damn well she can.
She'd out-manoeuvre you the best day you were ever born and she would stay and fight where you would ——, discreetly.
'Portrait,' he said.
'Boy or daughter or my one true love or whatever it is; you know what it is, portrait.
The Portrait, as before, did not answer.
But the Colonel, who was a General now again, early in the morning at the only time he really knew, and with Valpolicella, knew as absolutely as though he had just read his third Wassermann that there was no —— in Portrait and he felt shame for having talked to Portrait roughly.
'I'll be the best God-damned boy you ever witnessed to-day.
And you can tell your principal that.
Portrait, as was her fashion, was silent.
She probably would speak to a horse-cavalryman, the General, for now he had two stars and they grated on his shoulders and showed white in the vague, scuffed red on the plaque in front of his jeep.
He never used command cars, nor semi-armoured vehicles complete with sand-bags.
'The hell with you, Portrait,' he said.
'Or get your T.
slip from the universal chaplain of us all, with combined religions.
You ought to be able to eat on that.
'The hell with you,' the Portrait said, without speaking.
'You low class soldier.
'Yes,' the Colonel said, for now he was a Colonel again and had relinquished all his former rank.
'I love you, Portrait, very much.
But don't get rough with me.
I love you very much because you are beautiful.
But I love the girl better, a million times better, hear it?'.
There was no sign that she heard it, so he tired of it.
'You are in a fixed position, Portrait,' he said.
'Without or with any frame.
And I am going to manoeuvre.
The portrait was as silent as she had been since the concierge had brought her into the room, and aided and abetted by the second waiter, had shown her to the Colonel and to the girl.
The Colonel looked at her and saw she was indefensible, now that the light was good, or almost good.
He saw, too, that she was the portrait of his own true love and so he said, 'I am sorry for all the stupidnesses I say.
I do not wish ever to be brutal.
Maybe we could both sleep a little while, with luck, and then, perhaps, your Mistress would call on the telephone?'.
Maybe she will even call, he thought.
Chapter XVIII.
The hall porter pushed the Gazzettina under the door and the Colonel had it, noiselessly, almost as soon as it had passed through the slit.
He very nearly took it from the hall porter's hand.
He did not like the hall porter since he had found him, one day, going through his bag, when he, the Colonel, had re-entered the room after having left it, presumably for some time.
He had to come back to the room to get his bottle of medicine, which he had forgotten, and the hall porter was well through his bag.
'I guess you don't say stick them up in this hotel,' the Colonel had said.
'But you're no credit to your town.
There was silence produced and re-produced, by the striped waistcoated man with the Fascist face and the Colonel said, 'Go on, boy, look through the rest of it.
I don't carry any military secrets with my toilet articles.
Since then, there was scant friendship between them and the Colonel enjoyed trying to take the morning paper from the striped waistcoated man's hand; noiselessly, and when he heard, or saw it first make a move under the door.
, you won to-day, jerk,' he said in the best Venetian dialect he could summon at that hour.
'Go hang yourself.
But they don't hang themselves, he thought.
They just have to go on putting papers under other people's doors that do not even hate them.
It must be quite a difficult trade being an ex-Fascist.
Maybe he is not an ex-Fascist, too.
How do you know.
I can't hate Fascists, he thought.
Nor Krauts, either, since unfortunately, I am a soldier.
'Listen, Portrait,' he said.
'Do I have to hate the Krauts because we kill them? Do I have to hate them as soldiers and as human beings? It seems too easy a solution to me.
Well, Portrait.
Forget it.
Forget it.
You're not old enough to know about it.
You are two years younger than the girl that you portray and she is younger and older than hell; which is quite an old place.
'Listen, Portrait,' he said and, saying it, knew that now, as long as he lived, he would have someone to talk to at the early hours that he woke.
'As I was saying, Portrait.
The hell with that too.
That's too old for you too.
That is one of the things you can't say no matter how true it is.
There are lots of things I can never say to you and maybe that will be good for me.
It is about time something was.
What do you think would be good for me, Portrait?'.
'What's the matter, Portrait?' he asked her.
'You getting hungry? I am.
So he rang the bell for the waiter who would bring breakfast.
He knew that now, even though the light was so good that every wave showed on the Grand Canal, lead-coloured and solid heavy with the wind and the tide now high over the landing steps of the Palace directly opposite his room, that there would be no telephone call for several hours.
The young sleep good, he thought.
They deserve it.
'Why do we have to get old?' he asked the waiter who had come in with his glass-eye and the menu.
'I don't know, my Colonel.
I suppose it is a natural process.
'Yes.
I guess I imagine that too.
The eggs fried with their faces up.
Tea and toast.
'You don't want anything American?'.
'The hell with anything American except me.
Is the Gran Maestro astir yet?'.
'He has your Valpolicella in the big wicker fiascos of two litres and I have brought this decanter with it.
'That one,' the Colonel said.
'I wish to Christ I could give him a regiment.
'I don't think he would want one, really.
'No,' the Colonel said.
'I don't want one, really, myself.
Chapter XIX.
The colonel breakfasted with the leisure of a fighter who has been clipped badly, hears four and knows how to relax truly for five seconds more.
'Portrait,' he said.
'You ought to relax too.
That's the only thing that is going to be difficult about you.
That's what they call the static element in painting.
You know, Portrait that almost no pictures, paintings rather, move at all.
A few do, but not many.
'I wish that your mistress was here and we could have movement.
How do girls like you and she know so much so damn young and be so beautiful?.
'With us, if a girl is really beautiful, she comes from Texas and maybe, with luck, she can tell you what month it is.
They can all count good though.
'They teach them how to count and keep their legs together and how to put their hair up in pin curls.
Sometime, Portrait, for your sins, if you have any, you ought to have to sleep in a bed with a girl who has put her hair up in pin curls to be beautiful to-morrow.
Not to-night.
They'd never be beautiful to-night.
For to-morrow, when we make the competition.
'The girl, Renata, that you are, is sleeping now without ever having done anything to her hair.
She is sleeping with it spread out on the pillow and all it is to her is a glorious, dark, silky annoyance, that she can hardly remember to comb, except that her governess taught her.
'I see her in the street with the lovely long-legged stride and the wind doing anything it wants to her hair and her true breasts under the sweater and then I see the nights in Texas with the pin curls; tight and subjected by metallic instruments.
'Pin me no pin curls, my beloved,' he said to the portrait, 'and I will try to lay it on the line in round, heavy, hard silver dollars or with the other.
I mustn't get rough, he thought.
Then he said to the portrait, for he did not capitalize her now in his mind, 'You are so God-damned beautiful you stink.
Also you are jail-bait.
Renata's two years older now.
You are under seventeen.
And why can't I have her and love her and cherish her and never be rude, nor bad and have the five sons that go to the five corners of the world; wherever that is! I don't know.
I guess the cards we draw are those we get.
You wouldn't like to re-deal would you, dealer?.
They only deal to you once and then you pick them up and play them.
I can play them, if I draw any damn thing at all, he told portrait; who was also unimpressed.
'Portrait,' he said.
'You better look the other way so that you will not be un-maidenly.
I am going to take a shower now and shave, something you will never have to do, and put on my soldier-suit and go and walk around this town even though it is too early.
So, he got out of bed, favouring his bad leg, which hurt him always.
He pulled the reading light with his bad hand.
There was sufficient light and he had been wasting electricity for nearly an hour.
He regretted this as he regretted all his errors.
He walked past portrait, only looking casually and looked at himself in the mirror.
He had dropped both parts of his pyjamas and he looked at himself critically and truly.
'You beat-up old bastard,' he said to the mirror.
Portrait was a thing of the past.
Mirror was actuality and of this day.
The gut is flat, he said without uttering it.
The chest is all right except where it contains the defective muscle.
We are hung as we are hung, for better or worse, or something, or something awful.
You are one half a hundred years old, you bastard you.
Now go in and take a shower and scrub good and afterwards put on your soldier-suit.
To-day is another day.
Chapter XX.
The colonel stopped at the reception desk in the lobby, but the concierge was not there yet.
There was only the night porter.
'Can you put something in the safe for me?'.
'No, my Colonel.
No one may open the safe until the assistant manager, or the concierge, arrives.
But I will guard anything for you that you wish.
'Thank you.
It's not worth the trouble,' and he buttoned the Gritti envelope, with the stones inside, the envelope addressed to himself, into the inside left pocket of his tunic.
'There's no real crime here now,' the night porter said.
It had been a long night and he was happy to speak to someone.
'There never really was, my Colonel.
There are only differences of opinion and politics.
'What do you have for politics?' the Colonel asked; for he was lonely, too.
'About what you would expect.
'I see.
And how is your thing going?'.
'I think it goes quite well.
Maybe not as well as last year.
But still quite well.
We were beaten and we have to wait a while now.
'Do you work at it?'.
'Not much.
It is more the politics of my heart than of my head.
I believe in it with my head too, but I have very little political development.
'When you get it you won't have any heart.
'Maybe not.
Do you have politics in the army?'.
'Plenty,' the Colonel said.
'But not what you mean.
'Well, we better not discuss it then.
I have not meant to be intrusive.
'I asked the question; the original question rather.
It was only to talk.
It was not an interrogation.
'I don't think it was.
You do not have the face of an inquisitor, my Colonel, and I know about the Order, although I am not a member.
'You may be member material.
I'll take it up with the Gran Maestro.
'We come from the same town; but from distinct quarters.
'It's a good town.
'My Colonel, I have so little political development that I believe all honourable men are honourable.
'Oh you'll get over that,' the Colonel assured him.
'Don't worry, boy.
You've got a young party.
Naturally you make errors.
'Please don't talk like that.
'It was just rough early morning joking.
'Tell me, my Colonel, what do you really think about Tito?'.
'I think several things.
But he's my next-door neighbour.
I've found it better not to talk about my neighbour.
'I'd like to learn.
'Then learn it the hard way.
Don't you know people don't give answers to such questions?'.
'I had hoped they did.
'They don't,' the Colonel said.
'Not in my position.
All I can tell you is that Mr.
Tito has plenty problems.
'Well, I know that now truly,' the night porter who was really only a boy said.
'I hope you do,' the Colonel said.
'I wouldn't call it, as knowledge, any pearl of great price.
Now, good day, for I must take a walk for the good of my liver, or something.
'Good day, my Colonel.
Fa brutto tempo.
Chapter XXI.
The colonel took the ten centesimi gondola across the Canal, paying the usual dirty note and standing with the crowd of those condemned to early rising.
He looked back at the Gritti and saw the windows of his room; still open.
There was no promise, nor threat of rain; only the same strong, wild, cold wind from the mountains.
Everyone in the gondola looked cold and the Colonel thought, I wish I could issue these wind-proof coats to everyone on board.
God, and every officer that ever wore one, knows they are not water-proof and who made the money out of that one?.
You can't get water through a Burberry.
But I suppose some able jerk has his boy in Groton now, or maybe Canterbury, where the big contractors' boys go, because our coats leaked.
And what about some brother officer of mine who split with him? I wonder who the Benny Meyers of the ground forces were? There probably wasn't only one.
Probably, he thought, there must be very many.
You must not be awake yet, to talk that simply.
They do keep the wind out though.
The raincoats.
Raincoats my ass.
The gondola pulled up between the stakes on the far bank of the canal and the Colonel watched the black-clad people climb up out of the black-painted vehicle.
Is she a vehicle? he thought.
Or must a vehicle have wheels or be tracked?.
Nobody would give you a penny for your thoughts, he thought.
Not this morning.
But I've seen them worth a certain amount of money when the chips were down.
He penetrated into the far side of the city, the side that finally fronted on the Adriatic and that he liked the best.
He was going in by a very narrow street and he was going to not keep track of the number of more or less north and south streets that he crossed, nor count the bridges and then try and orient himself so he would come out at the market without getting up any dead ends.
It was a game you play, as some people used to play double Canfield or any solitary card games.
But it had the advantage of you moving while you do it and that you look at the houses, the minor vistas, the shops and the trattorias and at old palaces of the city of Venice while you are walking.
If you loved the city of Venice it was an excellent game.
It is a sort of solitaire ambulante and what you win is the happiness of your eye and heart.
If you made the market, on this side of town, without ever being stymied, you won the game.
But you must not make it too easy and you must not count.
On the other side of the town, game was to leave from the Gritti and make the Rialto by the Fondamente Nuove without a mistake.
Then you could climb the bridge and cross it and go down into the market.
He liked the market best.
It was the part of any town he always went to first.
Just then he heard the two young men behind him saying the things about him.
He knew they were young men by their voices and he did not look back, but listened carefully for distance and waited for the next turn to see them, as he turned.
They are on their way to work, he decided.
Maybe they are former Fascists or maybe they are something else, or maybe it is just the line that they are talking.
But they are making it pretty personal now.
It isn't just Americans, it is also me, myself, my grey hair, the slightly crooked way I walk, the combat boots (those, of that stripe, disliked the practicability of combat boots.
They liked boots that rang on the flag stones and took a high black polish).
It is my uniform which they find to be without grace.
Now it is why I am walking at this hour and now it is their absolute security that I can no longer make love.
The Colonel swung sharp to the left at the next corner, seeing what he had to deal with and the exact distance and when the two young men came around the corner which was formed by the apse of the church of Frari there was no Colonel.
He was in the dead angle behind the apse of the ancient church and as they passed, he, hearing them come by their talk, stepped out with a hand in each low pocket of his raincoat and turned himself and the raincoat, with the two hands in the pockets, towards them.
They stopped and he looked at them both in the face and smiled his old and worn death smile.
Then he looked down at their feet, as you always look at the feet of such people, since they wear their shoes too tight and when you take the shoes off them you see their hammer-toes.
The Colonel spat on the pavement and said nothing.
The two of them, they were the first thing he had suspected, looked at him with hatred and with that other thing.
Then they were off like marsh-birds, walking with the long strides of herons too, the Colonel thought, and something of the flight of curlews and looking back with hatred, waiting to have the last word if the distance was ever safe.
It is a pity they weren't ten against one, the Colonel thought.
They might have fought.
I should not blame them, since they were defeated.
But their manners were not good in respect to a man of my rank and age.
Also it was not intelligent to think all fifty-year-old colonels would not understand their language.
Nor was it intelligent to think old Infantrymen would not fight this early in the morning against the simple odds of two to one.
I'd hate to fight in this town where I love the people.
I would avoid it.
But couldn't those badly educated youths realize what sort of animal they were dealing with? Don't they know how you get to walk that way? Nor any of the other signs that combat people show as surely as a fisherman's hands tell you if he is a fisherman from the creases from the cord cuts.
It is true they only saw my back and ass and legs and boots.
But you'd think they might have told from the way they must move.
Maybe they don't any more.
But when I had a chance to look at them and think.
Take the two of them out and hang them, I believe they understood.
They understood quite clearly.
What's a man's life worth anyway? Ten thousand dollars if his insurance is paid up in our army.
What the hell has that got to do with it.
Oh yes, that was what I was thinking about before those jerks showed; how much money I had saved my government, in my time when people like Benny Meyers were in the trough.
Yes, he said and how much you lost them at the Chateau that time at ten Gs a head.
Well nobody ever really understood it except me, I guess.
There's no reason to tell them now.
Your commanding general sometimes puts things down as the Fortunes of War.
Back at Army they know such things are bound to happen.
You do it, as ordered, with a big butcher bill and you're a hero.
Christ, I am opposed to the excessive butcher bill, he thought.
But you get the orders, and you have to carry them out.
It is the mistakes that are no good to sleep with.
But why the hell sleep with them anyway.
It never did any good.
But they can certainly crawl into a sack sometimes.
They can crawl in and stay in there with you.
Cheer up, boy, he said.
Remember you had a lot of money on you when you picked that one.
And you might have been stripped if you lost.
You can't fight a lick any more with your hands and you didn't have any weapon.
So don't be gloomy, boy, or man, or Colonel, or busted General.
We're almost to the market now and you made it without hardly noticing.
Hardly noticing is bad, he added.
Chapter XXII.
He loved the market.
A great part of it was close-packed and crowded into several side streets and it was so concentrated that it was difficult not to jostle people, unintentionally, and each time you stopped to look, to buy, or to admire, you formed an îlot de résistance against the flow of the morning attack of the purchasers.
The Colonel liked to study the spread and high piled cheeses and the great sausages.
People at home think mortadella is a sausage, he thought.
Then he said to the woman in the booth, 'Let me try a little of that sausage, please.
Only a sliver.
She cut a thin, paper thin, slice for him, ferociously and lovingly, and when the Colonel tasted it there was the half smoky, black pepper-corned, true flavour of the meat from the hogs that ate acorns in the mountains.
'I will take a quarter of a kilo.
The Barone's lunches for the shooting blinds were of a Spartan quality, which the Colonel respected, since he knew no one should eat much while shooting.
He felt, though, that he might augment the lunch with his sausage and share it with the poler and picker-upper.
He might give a slice to Bobby, the retriever, who would be wet through to his hide many times and enthusiastic still, but shaking with cold.
'Is this the best sausage that you have?' he asked the woman.
'Have you nothing that does not show and is reserved for better and steadier customers?'.
'This is the best sausage.
There are many other sausages, as you know.
But this is the best.
'Then give me one-eighth of a kilo of a sausage that is highly fortifying, but is not highly seasoned.
'I have it,' she said.
'It is a little new but exactly as you describe.
This sausage was for Bobby.
But you do not say that you buy sausages for a dog in Italy where the worst crime is to be considered a fool and many people go hungry.
You may give expensive sausage to a dog before a man who works for his living and knows what a dog goes through in water in cold weather.
But you do not buy them, stating your purpose in possessing them, unless you are a fool, or a millionaire from the war and from after.
The Colonel paid for the wrapped-up package and proceeded on through the market inhaling the smell of roasted coffee and looking at the amount of fat on each carcass in the butcher section, as though he were enjoying the Dutch painters, whose names no one remembers, who painted, in perfection of detail, all things you shot, or that were eatable.
A market is the closest thing to a good museum like the Prado or as the Accademia is now, the Colonel thought.
He took a short cut and was at the fish market.
In the market, spread on the slippery stone floor, or in their baskets, or their rope-handled boxes, were the heavy, grey-green lobsters with their magenta overtones that presaged their death in boiling water.
They have all been captured by treachery, the Colonel thought, and their claws are pegged.
There were the small soles and there were a few albacore and bonito.
These last, the Colonel thought, looked like boat-tailed bullets, dignified in death and with the huge eye of the pelagic fish.
They were not made to be caught except for their voraciousness.
The poor sole exists, in shallow water, to feed man.
But these other roving bullets, in their great bands, live in blue water and travel through all oceans and all seas.
A nickel for your thoughts now, he thought.
Let's see what else they have.
There were many eels, alive and no longer confident in their eeldom.
There were fine prawns that could make a scampi brochetto spitted and broiled on a rapier-like instrument that could be used as a Brooklyn ice-pick.
There were medium-sized shrimps, grey and opalescent, awaiting their turn, too, for the boiling water and their immortality, to have their shucked carcasses float out easily on an ebb tide on the Grand Canal.
The speedy shrimp, the Colonel thought, with tentacles longer than the moustaches of that old Japanese admiral, comes here now to die for our benefit.
Oh Christian shrimp, he thought, master of retreat, and with your wonderful intelligence service in those two light whips, why did they not teach you about nets and that lights are dangerous?.
Must have been some slip-up, he thought.
Now he looked at the many small crustaceans, the razor-edge clams you only should eat raw if you had your typhoid shots up to date, and all the small delectables.
He went past these, stopping to ask one seller where his clams came from.
They came from a good place, without sewerage, and the Colonel asked to have six opened.
He drank the juice and cut the clam out, cutting close against the shell with the curved knife the man handed him.
The man had handed him the knife because he knew from experience the Colonel cut closer to the shell than he had been taught to cut.
The Colonel paid him the pittance that they cost, which must have been much greater than the pittance those received who caught them, and he thought, now I must see the stream and canal fishes and get back to the hotel.
Chapter XXIII.
The colonel arrived at the lobby of the Hotel Gritti-Palace.
His gondolieres were paid off and, now, inside the hotel, there was no wind.
It had taken two men to bring the gondola up the Grand Canal from the market.
They had both worked hard, and he had paid them what it was worth, and some more.
'Are there any calls for me?' he asked the concierge, who was now in attendance.
The concierge was light, fast, sharp-faced, intelligent and polite, always, without subservience.
He wore the crossed keys of his office on the lapels of his blue uniform without ostentation.
He was the concierge.
It is a rank very close to that of Captain, the Colonel thought.
An officer and not a Gentleman.
Make it top sergeant in the old days; except he's dealing always with the brass.
'My lady has called twice,' the concierge said in English.
Or whatever that language should be called we all speak, the Colonel thought.
Leave it at English.
That is about what they have left.
They should be allowed to keep the name of the language.
Cripps will probably ration it shortly, anyway.
'Please put me through to her at once,' he told the concierge.
The concierge commenced to dial numbers.
'You may talk over there, my Colonel,' he said.
'I have made the connection.
'You're fast.
'Over there,' the concierge said.
Inside the booth the Colonel lifted the receiver and said, automatically, 'Colonel Cantwell speaking.
'I called twice, Richard,' the girl said.
'But they explained that you were out.
Where were you?'.
'At the market.
How are you, my lovely?'.
'No one listens on this phone at this hour.
I am your lovely.
Whoever that is.
'You.
Did you sleep well?'.
'It was like ski-ing in the dark.
Not really ski-ing but really dark.
'That's the way it should be.
Why did you wake so early? You've frightened my concierge.
'If it is not un-maidenly, how soon can we meet, and where?'.
'Where you wish and when you wish.
'Do you still have the stones and did Miss Portrait help any?'.
'Yes to both questions.
The stones are in my upper left-hand pocket and buttoned down.
Miss Portrait and I talked late and early and it made everything much easier.
'Do you love her more than me?'.
'I'm not abnormal yet.
Perhaps that's bragging.
But she's lovely.
'Where should we meet?'.
'Should we have breakfast at the Florian, on the right-hand side of the square? The square should be flooded and it will be fun to watch.
'I'll be there in twenty minutes if you want me.
'I want you,' the Colonel said and hung up.
Coming out of the telephone booth he, suddenly, did not feel good and then he felt as though the devil had him in an iron cage, built like an iron lung or an iron maiden, and he walked, grey-faced, to the concierge's desk and said, in Italian, 'Domenico, Ico, could you get me a glass of water, please?'.
The concierge was gone and he leaned on the desk resting.
He rested lightly and without illusion.
Then the concierge was back with the glass of water, and he took four tablets of the type that you take two, and he continued resting as lightly as a hawk rests.
'Domenico,' he said.
'Yes.
'I have something here in an envelope that you can put in the safe.
It may be called for either by myself, in person, or in writing, or by the person you have just put that call through to.
Would you like that in writing?'.
'No.
It would be unnecessary.
'But what about you, boy? You're not immortal, are you?'.
'Fairly so,' the concierge told him.
'But I will put it in writing, and after me, comes the Manager and the Assistant Manager.
'Both good men,' the Colonel agreed.
'Wouldn't you like to sit down, my Colonel?'.
'No.
Who sits down except men and women in change of life hotels? Do you sit down?'.
'No.
'I can rest on my feet, or against a God-damned tree.
My countrymen sit down, or lie down, or fall down.
Give them a few energy crackers to stall their whimpers.
He was talking too much to regain confidence quickly.
'Do they really have energy crackers?'.
'Sure.
It has something in it that keeps you from getting excited.
It's like the atomic bomb, only played backwards.
'I can't believe it.
'We have the most terrific military secrets that one General's wife ever told another.
Energy crackers is the least of it.
Next time we will give all Venice botulism from 56,000 feet.
There's nothing to it,' the Colonel explained.
'They give you anthrax, and you give them botulism.
'But it will be horrible.
'It will be worse than that,' the Colonel assured him.
'This isn't classified.
It's all been published.
And while it goes on you can hear Margaret, if you tune in right, singing the Star Spangled Banner on the radio.
I think that could be arranged.
The voice I would not describe as a big one.
Not as we know voices who have heard the good ones in our time.
But everything is a trick now.
The radio can almost make the voice.
And the Star Spangled Banner is fool-proof until towards the last.
'Do you think they will drop anything here?'.
'No.
They never have.
The Colonel, who was four star general now, in his wrath and in his agony and in his need for confidence, but secured temporarily through the absorption of the tablets, said, 'Ciao, Domenico,' and left the Gritti.
He figured it took twelve and one half minutes to reach the place where his true love would probably arrive a little late.
He walked it carefully and at the speed he should walk it.
The bridges were all the same.
Chapter XXIV.
His true love was at the table at the exact time that she said she would be.
She was as beautiful as always In the hard, morning light that came across the flooded square, and she said, 'Please, Richard.
Are you all right? Please?'.
'Sure,' the Colonel said.
'You wonder beauty.
'Did you go to all our places in the market?'.
'Only a few of them.
I did not go where they have the wild ducks.
'Thank you.
'For nothing,' the Colonel said.
'I never go there when we are not together.
'Don't you think I should go to the shoot?'.
'No.
I am quite sure.
Alvarito would have asked you if he wanted you.
'He might not have asked me because he wanted me.
'That's true,' the Colonel said, and pondered that for two seconds.
'What do you want for breakfast?'.
'Breakfast is worthless here, and I don't like the square when it is flooded.
It is sad and the pigeons have no place to alight.
It is only really fun towards the last when the children play.
Should we go and have breakfast at the Gritti?'.
'Do you want to?'.
'Yes.
'Good.
We'll have breakfast there.
I've had mine already.
'Really?'.
'I'll have some coffee and hot rolls, and only feel them with my fingers.
Are you awfully hungry?'.
'Awfully,' she said, truly.
'We'll give breakfast the full treatment,' the Colonel said.
'You'll wish you had never heard of breakfast.
As they walked, with the wind at their back, and her hair blowing better than any banner, she asked him, holding close, 'Do you still love me in the cold, hard Venice light of morning? It is really cold and hard, isn't it?'.
'I love you and it is cold and hard.
'I loved you all night when I was ski-ing in the dark.
'How do you do that?'.
'It is the same runs except that it is dark and the snow is dark instead of light.
You ski the same; controlled and good.
'Did you ski all night? That would be many runs.
'No.
Afterwards I slept soundly and well and I woke happy.
You were with me and you were asleep like a baby.
'I wasn't with you and I was not asleep.
'You're with me now,' she said and held close and tight.
'And we are almost there.
'Yes.
'Have I told you, yet, properly, that I love you?'.
'You told me.
But tell me again.
'I love you,' he said.
'Take it frontally and formally please.
'I take it anyway you want as long as it is true.
'That's the proper attitude,' he said.
'You good, brave, lovely girl.
Turn your hair sideways once on top of this bridge and let it blow obliquely.
He had made a concession, with obliquely, instead of saying, correctly, oblique.
'That's easy,' she said.
'Do you like it?'.
He looked and saw the profile and the wonder early morning colour and her chest upstanding in the black sweater and her eyes in the wind and he said, 'Yes, I like it.
'I'm very glad,' she said.
Chapter XXV.
At the Gritti, the Gran Maestro seated them at the table which was beside the window that looked out on the Grand Canal.
There was no one else in the dining-room.
The Gran Maestro was festive and well with the morning.
He took his ulcers day by day, and his heart the same way.
When they did not hurt he did not hurt either.
'Your pitted compatriot eats in bed at his hotel, my colleague tells me,' he confided to the Colonel.
'We may have a few Belgians.
"The bravest of these were the Belgians,"' he quoted.
'There is a pair of pescecani from you know where.
But they are exhausted and I believe they will eat, as pigs, in their room.
'An excellent situation report,' the Colonel said.
'Our problem, Gran Maestro, is that I have already eaten in my room as pitted does and as the pescecani will.
But this lady——'.
'Young girl,' interrupted the Gran Maestro with his whole-face smile.
He was feeling very good since it was a completely new day.
'This very young lady wants a breakfast to end breakfasts.
'I understand,' the Gran Maestro said, and he looked at Renata and his heart rolled over as a porpoise does in the sea.
It is a beautiful movement and only a few people in this world can feel it and accomplish it.
'What do you want to eat, Daughter?' the Colonel asked, looking at her early morning, un-retouched dark beauty.
'Everything.
'Would you give any suggestions?'.
'Tea instead of coffee and whatever the Gran Maestro can salvage.
'It won't be salvage, Daughter,' said the Gran Maestro.
'I'm the one who calls her Daughter.
'I said it honestly,' the Gran Maestro said.
'We can make or fabricar rognons grilled with champignons dug by people I know.
Or, raised in damp cellars.
There can be an omelet with truffles dug by pigs of distinction.
There can be real Canadian bacon from maybe Canada, even.
'Wherever that is,' the girl said happily and unillusioned.
'Wherever that is,' said the Colonel seriously.
'And I know damn well where it is.
'I think we should stop the jokes now and get to the breakfast.
'If it is not un-maidenly I think so too.
'Mine is a decanted flask of the Valpolicella.
'Nothing else?'.
'Bring me one ration of the alleged Canadian bacon,' the Colonel said.
He looked at the girl, since they were alone now, and he said, 'How are you, my dearest?'.
'Quite hungry, I suppose.
But thank you for being good for so long a time.
'It was easy,' the Colonel told her in Italian.
Chapter XXVI.
They sat there at the table and watched the early stormy light over the Canal.
The grey had turned to a yellow-grey now, with the sun, and the waves were working against the outgoing tide.
'Mummy says she can't live here too long at any time because there are no trees,' the girl said.
'That's why she goes to the country.
'That's why everyone goes to the country,' the Colonel said.
'We could plant a few trees if we found a place with a big enough garden.
'I like Lombardy poplars and plane trees the best, but I am still quite uneducated.
'I like them, and cypresses and chestnut trees.
The real chestnut and the horse-chestnut.
But you will never see trees, Daughter, until we go to America.
Wait till you see a white pine or a ponderosa pine.
'Will we see them when we make the long trip and stop at all the filling stations or comfort stations or whatever they are called?'.
'Lodges and Tourist Camps,' the Colonel said.
'Those others we stop at; but not for the night.
'I want so much for us to roll up to a comfort station and plank down my money and tell them to fill her up and check the oil, Mac, the way it is in American books or in the films.
'That's a filling station.
'Then what is a comfort station?'.
'Where you go, you know——'.
'Oh,' the girl said and blushed.
'I'm sorry.
'I want to learn American so much.
But I suppose I shall say barbarous things the way you do sometimes in Italian.
'It is an easy language.
The further West you go the straighter and the easier it becomes.
The Gran Maestro brought the breakfast and the odour of it, although it did not spread through the room, due to the silver covers on the dishes, came to them steady and as broiled bacon and kidneys, with the dark lustreless smell of grilled mushrooms added.
'It looks lovely,' the girl said.
'Thank you very much, Gran Maestro.
Should I talk American?' she asked the Colonel.
She extended her hand to the Gran Maestro lightly, and fastly, so that it darted as a rapier does, and said, 'Put it there, Pal.
This grub is tops.
The Gran Maestro said, 'Thank you, my lady.
'Should I have said chow instead of grub?' the girl asked the Colonel.
'They are really interchangeable.
'Did they talk like that out West when you were a boy? What would you say at breakfast?'.
'Breakfast was served, or offered up, by the cook.
He would say, "Come and get it, you sons of bitches, or I'll throw it away.
'I must learn that for in the country.
Sometimes when we have the British Ambassador and his dull wife for dinner I will teach the footman, who will announce dinner, to say, "Come and get it, you sons of bitches, or we will throw it away.
'He'd devaluate,' the Colonel said.
'At any rate, it would be an interesting experiment.
'Tell me something I can say in true American to the pitted one if he comes in.
I will just whisper it in his ear as though I were making a rendezvous, as they did in the old days.
'It would depend on how he looks.
If he is very dejected looking, you might whisper to him, "Listen, Mac.
You hired out to be tough, didn't you?"'.
'That's lovely,' she said, and repeated it in a voice she had learned from Ida Lupino.
'Can I say it to the Gran Maestro?'.
'Sure.
Why not.
Gran Maestro!'.
The Gran Maestro came over and leaned forward attentively.
'Listen, Mac.
You hired out to be tough, didn't you?' the girl hard-worded him.
'I did indeed,' the Gran Maestro said.
'Thank you for stating it so exactly.
'If that one comes in and you wish to speak to him after he has eaten, just whisper in his ear, "Wipe the egg off your chin, Jack, and straighten up and fly right.
'I'll remember it and I'll practise it at home.
'What are we going to do after breakfast?'.
'Should we go up and look at the picture and see if it is of any value; I mean any good; in the daylight?'.
'Yes,' the Colonel said.
Chapter XXVII.
Upstairs the room was already done and the Colonel, who had anticipated a possible messiness of locale, was pleased.
'Stand by it once,' he said.
Then remembered to add, 'Please.
She stood by it, and he looked at it from where he had looked at it last night.
'There's no comparison, of course,' he said.
'I don't mean likeness.
The likeness is excellent.
'Was there supposed to be a comparison?' the girl asked, and swung her head back and stood there with the black sweater of the portrait.
'Of course not.
But last night, and at first light, I talked to the portrait as though it were you.
'That was nice of you and shows it has served some useful purpose.
They were lying now on the bed and the girl said to him, 'Don't you ever close windows?'.
'No.
Do you?'.
'Only when it rains.
'How much alike are we?'.
'I don't know.
We never had much of a chance to find out.
'We've never had a fair chance.
But we've had enough of a chance for me to know.
'And when you know what the hell have you got?' the Colonel asked.
'I don't know.
Something better than there is, I suppose.
'Sure.
We ought to try for that.
I don't believe in limited objectives.
Sometimes you're forced to, though.
'What is your great sorrow?'.
'Other people's orders,' he said.
'What's yours?'.
'You.
'I don't want to be a sorrow.
I've been a sorry son of a bitch many times.
But I never was anybody's sorrow.
'Well you are mine now.
'All right,' he said.
'We'll take it that way.
'You're nice to take it that way.
You're very kind this morning.
I'm so ashamed about how things are.
Please hold me very close and let's not talk, or think, about how things might have been different.
'Daughter, that's one of the few things I know how to do.
'You know many, many things.
Don't say such a thing.
'Sure,' the Colonel said.
'I know how to fight forwards and how to fight backwards and what else?'.
'About pictures and about books and about life.
'That's easy.
You just look at the pictures without prejudice, and you read the books with as open a mind as you have, and you live life.
'Don't take off your tunic, please.
'All right.
'You do anything when I say please.
'I have done things without.
'Not very often.
'No,' the Colonel agreed.
'Please is a pretty word.
'Please, please, please.
'Per Piacere.
It means for pleasure.
I wish we always talked Italian.
'We could in the dark.
Although there are things that say better in English.
'I love you my last true and only love,' she quoted.
'When lilacs last in the door-yard bloomed.
And out of the cradle endlessly rocking.
And come and get it, you sons of bitches, or I'll throw it away.
You don't want those in other languages, do you, Richard?'.
'No.
'Kiss me again, please.
'Unnecessary please.
'I would probably end up as an unnecessary please myself.
That is the good thing about you going to die that you can't leave me.
'That's a little rough,' the Colonel said.
'Watch your beautiful mouth a little on that.
'I get rough when you get rough,' she said.
'You wouldn't want me to be completely otherwise?'.
'I would not want you to be in any way other than you are and I love you truly, finally and for good.
'You say nice things very clearly sometimes.
What was it happened with you and your wife, if I may ask?'.
'She was an ambitious woman and I was away too much.
'You mean she went away, from ambition, when you only were away from duty?'.
'Sure,' the Colonel said and remembered, as unbitterly as he could.
'She had more ambition than Napoleon and about the talent of the average High School Valedictorian.
'Whatever that is,' the girl said.
'But let's not speak about her.
I'm sorry I asked the question.
She must be sad that she is not with you.
'No.
She is too conceited ever to be sad, and she married me to advance herself in Army circles, and have better contacts for what she considered her profession, or her art.
She was a journalist.
'But they are dreadful,' the girl said.
'I agree.
'But you couldn't have married a woman journalist that kept on being that?'.
'I told you I made mistakes,' the Colonel said.
'Let's talk about something nice.
'Let's.
'But that was terrible.
How could you have done such a thing?'.
'I don't know.
I could tell you in detail but let's skip it.
'Please let's skip it.
But I had no idea it was something as awful as that.
You wouldn't do such a thing now, would you?'.
'I promise you, my sweet.
'But you don't ever write to her?'.
'Of course not.
'You wouldn't tell her about us, so she could write about it?'.
'No.
I told her about things once, and she wrote about them.
But that was in another country and besides the wench is dead.
'Is she really dead?'.
'Deader than Phoebus the Phoenician.
But she doesn't know it yet.
'What would you do if we were together in the Piazza and you saw her?'.
'I'd look straight through her to show her how dead she was.
'Thank you very much,' the girl said.
'You know that another woman, or a woman in memory, is a terrible thing for a young girl to deal with when she is still without experience.
'There isn't any other woman,' the Colonel told her, and his eyes were bad and remembering.
'Nor is there any woman of memory.
'Thank you, very much,' the girl said.
'When I look at you I believe it truly.
But please never look at me nor think of me like that.
'Should we hunt her down and hang her to a high tree?' the Colonel said with anticipation.
'No.
Let us forget her.
'She is forgotten,' the Colonel said.
And, strangely enough, she was.
It was strange because she had been present in the room for a moment, and she had very nearly caused a panic; which is one of the strangest things there is, the Colonel thought.
He knew about panics.
But she was gone now, for good and for ever; cauterized; exorcized and with the eleven copies of her re-classification papers, in which was included the formal, notarized act of divorcement, in triplicate.
'She is forgotten,' the Colonel said.
It was quite true.
'I'm so pleased,' the girl said.
'I don't know why they ever let her into the hotel.
'We're enough alike,' the Colonel said.
'We better not carry it too God-damned far.
'You can hang her if you wish because she is why we cannot marry.
'She's forgotten,' the Colonel told her.
'Maybe she will take a good look at herself in the mirror sometime and hang herself.
'Now that she is out of the room we should wish her no bad luck.
But, as a good Venetian, I wish that she were dead.
'So do I,' the Colonel said.
'And now, since she is not, let us forget her for keeps.
'For keeps and for always,' the girl said.
'I hope that is the correct diction.
Or in Spanish para sempre.
'Para sempre and his brother,' the Colonel said.
Chapter XXVIII.
They lay together now and did not speak and the Colonel felt her heart beat.
It is easy to feel a heart beat under a black sweater knitted by someone in the family, and her dark hair lay, long and heavy, over his good arm.
It isn't heavy, he thought, it is lighter than anything there is.
She lay, quiet and loving, and whatever it was that they possessed was in complete communication.
He kissed her on the mouth, gently and hungrily, and then it was as though there was static, suddenly, when communications had been perfect.
'Richard,' she said.
'I'm sorry about things.
'Never be sorry,' the Colonel said.
'Never discuss casualties, Daughter.
'Say it again.
'Daughter.
'Will you tell me some happy things I can have for during the week and some more of war for my education?'.
'Let's skip war.
'No.
I need it for my education.
'I do too,' the Colonel said.
'Not manoeuvres.
You know, in our army once, a general officer through chicanery obtained the plan of the manoeuvre.
He anticipated every move of the enemy force and comported himself so brilliantly that he was promoted over many better men.
And that was why we got smacked one time.
That and the prevalence of week-ends.
'We're on a week-end now.
'I know,' the Colonel said.
'I can still count up to seven.
'But are you bitter about everything?'.
'No.
It is just that I am half a hundred years old and I know things.
'Tell me something more about Paris because I love to think of you and Paris in the week.
'Daughter, why don't you lay off Paris?'.
'But I've been in Paris, and I will go back there again, and I want to know.
It is the loveliest city in the world, next to our own, and I want to know some things truly to take with me.
'We will go together and I will tell you there.
'Thank you.
But tell me a little now for this week only.
'Leclerc was a high-born jerk as I think that I've explained.
Very brave, very arrogant and extremely ambitious.
He is dead, as I said.
'Yes, you told me.
'They say you should never speak ill of the dead.
But I think it is the best time to speak truly of them.
I have never said anything of a dead that I would not say to his face,' and he added, 'in spades.
'Let's not talk about him.
I have re-classified him in my mind.
'What do you want then; picturesque?'.
'Yes please.
I have bad taste from reading the illustrated papers.
But I will read Dante all week while you are gone.
I'll go to mass each morning.
That should be enough.
'Go to Harry's before lunch too.
'I will,' she said.
'Please tell me some picturesque.
'Don't you think we might better just go to sleep?'.
'How can we go to sleep now when we have so little time? Feel this,' she said and pushed her whole head up under his chin until she forced his head back.
'All right, I'll talk.
'Give me your hand first to hold.
I'll have it in my hand when I read the Dante and do the other things.
'Dante was an execrable character.
More conceited than Leclerc.
'I know.
But he did not write execrably.
'No.
Leclerc could fight too.
Excellently.
'Now tell me.
Her head was on his chest now, and the Colonel said, 'Why did you not want me to take off the tunic?'.
'I like to feel the buttons.
Is it wrong?'.
'I'll be a sad son of a bitch,' the Colonel said.
'How many people fought in your family?'.
'Everybody,' she said.
'Always.
They were traders as well and several of them were Doges of this city as you know.
'But they all fought?'.
'All,' she said.
'As far as I know.
,' the Colonel said.
'I'll tell you any God-damn thing you want to know.
'Just something picturesque.
As bad or worse than in the illustrated papers.
'Domenica Del Corriere or Tribuna Illustrata?'.
'Worse, if possible.
'Kiss me first.
She kissed him kind, and hard, and desperately, and the Colonel could not think about any fights or any picturesque or strange incidents.
He only thought of her and how she felt and how close life comes to death when there is ecstasy.
And what the hell is ecstasy and what's ecstasy's rank and serial number? And how does her black sweater feel? And who made all her smoothness and delight and the strange pride and sacrifice and wisdom of a child? Yes, ecstasy is what you might have had and instead you draw sleep's other brother.
Death is a lot of ——, he thought.
It comes to you in small fragments that hardly show where it has entered.
It comes, sometimes, atrociously.
It can come from unboiled water; an un-pulled-up mosquito boot, or it can come with the great, white-hot, clanging roar we have lived with.
It comes in small cracking whispers that precede the noise of the automatic weapon.
It can come with the smoke-emitting arc of the grenade, or the sharp, cracking drop of the mortar.
I have seen it come, loosening itself from the bomb rack, and falling with that strange curve.
It comes in the metallic rending crash of a vehicle, or the simple lack of traction on a slippery road.
It comes in bed to most people, I know, like love's opposite number.
I have lived with it nearly all my life and the dispensing of it has been my trade.
But what can I tell this girl now on this cold, windy morning in the Gritti Palace Hotel?.
'What would you like to know, Daughter?' he asked her.
'Everything.
'All right,' the Colonel said.
'Here goes.
Chapter XXIX.
They lay on the pleasantly hard, new-made bed with their legs pressed tight against one another, and her head was on his chest, and her hair spread across his old hard neck; and he told her.
'We landed without much opposition.
They had the true opposition at the other beach.
Then we had to link up with the people who had been dropped, and take and secure various towns, and then we took Cherbourg.
This was difficult, and had to be done very fast, and the orders were from a General called Lightning Joe that you never would have heard of.
Good General.
'Go on, please.
You spoke about Lightning Joe before.
'After Cherbourg we had everything.
I took nothing but an admiral's compass because I had a small boat at that time on Chesapeake Bay.
But we had all the Wehrmacht stamped Martell and some people had as much as six million German-printed French francs.
They were good until a year ago, and at that time they were worth fifty to the dollar, and many a man has a tractor now instead of simply one mule who knew how to send them home through his Esses, or sometimes his Gs.
'I never stole anything except the compass because I thought it was bad luck to steal, unnecessarily, in war.
But I drank the cognac and I used to try to figure out the different corrections on the compass when I had time.
The compass was the only friend I had, and the telephone was my life.
We had more wire strung than there are —— in Texas.
'Please keep telling me and be as little rough as you can.
I don't know what the word means and I don't want to know.
'Texas is a big state,' the Colonel said.
'That is why I used it and its female population as a symbol.
You cannot say more —— than Wyoming because there are less than thirty thousand there, perhaps, hell, make it fifty, and there was a lot of wire, and you kept stringing it and rolling it up, and stringing it again.
'Go on.
'We will cut to the break-through,' the Colonel said.
'Please tell me if this bores you.
'No.
'So we made the mucking break-through,' the Colonel said, and now his head was turned to her head, and he was not lecturing; he was confessing.
'The first day most of them came over and dropped the Christmas tree ornaments that confuse the other people's radar and it was called off.
We were ready to go but they called it off.
Quite properly I am sure.
I love the very high brass like I love the pig's you know.
'Tell it to me and don't be bad.
'Conditions were not propitious,' the Colonel said.
'So the second day we were for it, as our British cousins, who could not fight their way out of a wet tissue towel, say, and over came the people of the wild, blue yonder.
'They were still taking off from the fields where they lived on that green-grassed aircraft carrier that they called England, when we saw the first of them.
'Shining, bright and beautiful, because they had scraped the invasion paint by then, or maybe they had not.
My memory is not exact about this part.
'Anyway, Daughter, you could see the line of them going back towards the east further than you could see.
It was like a great train.
They were high in the sky and never more beautiful.
I told my S-2 that we should call them the Valhalla Express.
Are you tired of it?'.
'No.
I can see the Valhalla Express.
We never saw it in such numbers.
But we saw it.
Many times.
'We were back two thousand yards from where we were to take off from.
You know what two thousand yards is, Daughter, in a war when you are attacking?'.
'No.
How could I?'.
'Then the front part of the Valhalla Express dropped coloured smoke and turned and went home.
This smoke was dropped accurately, and clearly showed the target which was the Kraut positions.
They were good positions and it might have been impossible to move him out of them without something mighty and picturesque such as we were experiencing.
'Then, Daughter, the next sections of the Valhalla Express dropped everything in the world on the Krauts and where they lived and worked to hold us up.
Later it looked as though all of the earth had erupted and the prisoners that we took shook as a man shakes when his malaria hits him.
They were very brave boys from the Sixth Parachute Division and they all shook and could not control it though they tried.
'So you can see it was a good bombing.
Just the thing we always need in this life.
Make them tremble in the fear of justice and of might.
'So then, Daughter, not to bore you, the wind was from the east and the smoke began to blow back in our direction.
The heavies were bombing on the smoke line and the smoke line was now over us.
Therefore they bombed us the same as they had bombed the Krauts.
First it was the heavies, and no one need ever worry about hell who was there that day.
Then, to really make the break-through good and to leave as few people as possible on either side, the mediums came over and bombed who was left.
Then we made the break-through as soon as the Valhalla Express had gone home, stretching in its beauty and its majesty from that part of France to all over England.
If a man has a conscience, the Colonel thought, he might think about air-power some time.
'Give me a glass of that Valpolicella,' the Colonel said, and remembered to add, 'please.
'Excuse me,' he said.
'Be comfortable, honey dog, please.
You asked me to tell you.
'I'm not your honey dog.
That must be someone else.
'Correct.
You're my last and true and only love.
Is that correct? But you asked me to tell you.
'Please tell me,' the girl said.
'I'd like to be your honey dog if I knew how to do it.
But I am only a girl from this town that loves you.
'We'll operate on that,' the Colonel said.
'And I love you.
I probably picked up that phrase in the Philippines.
'Probably,' the girl said.
'But I would rather be your straight girl.
'You are,' the Colonel said.
'Complete with handles and with the flag on top.
'Please don't be rough,' she said.
'Please love me true and tell me as true as you can, without hurting yourself in any way.
'I'll tell you true,' he said.
'As true as I can tell and let it hurt who it hurts.
It is better that you hear it from me if you have curiosity on this subject, than that you read it in some book with stiff covers.
'Please don't be rough.
Just tell me true and hold me tight and tell me true until you are purged of it; if that can be.
'I don't need to purge,' he said.
'Except heavies being used tactically.
I have nothing against them if they use them right even if they kill you.
But for ground support give me a man like Pete Quesada.
There is a man who will boot them in.
'Please.
'If you ever want to quit a beat-up character like me that guy could give you ground support.
'You are not beat-up, whatever that is, and I love you.
'Please give me two tablets from that bottle and pour the glass of Valpolicella that you neglected to pour, and I will tell you some of the rest of it.
'You don't have to.
You don't have to tell me and I know now it is not good for you.
Especially not the Valhalla Express day.
I am not an inquisitor; or whatever the female of inquisitor is.
Let us just lie quietly and look out of the window, and watch and see what happens on our Grand Canal.
'Maybe we better.
Who gives a damn about the war anyway?'.
'You and me, maybe,' she said and stroked his head.
'Here are the two things from the square bottle.
Here is the glass of decanted vino.
I'll send you better from our own estates.
Please let us sleep a little while.
Please be a good boy and we just lie together and love each other.
Please put your hand here.
'My good or my bad?'.
'Your bad,' the girl said.
'The one I love and must think about all week.
I cannot keep it like you keep the stones.
'They're in the safe,' the Colonel said.
'In your name,' he added.
'Let's just sleep and not talk about any material things nor any sorrows.
'The hell with sorrows,' the Colonel said with his eyes closed and his head resting lightly on the black sweater that was his fatherland.
You have to have some damned fatherland, he thought.
Here is mine.
'Why aren't you President?' the girl asked.
'You could be an excellent president.
'Me president? I served in the Montana National Guard when I was sixteen.
But I never wore a bow tie in my life and I am not, nor ever have been, an unsuccessful haberdasher.
I have none of the qualifications for the Presidency.
I couldn't even head the opposition even though I don't have to sit on telephone books to have my picture taken.
Nor am I a no-fight general.
Hell, I never even was at SHAEF.
I couldn't even be an elder statesman.
I'm not old enough.
Now we are governed in some way, by the dregs.
We are governed by what you find in the bottom of dead beer glasses that whores have dunked their cigarettes in.
The place has not even been swept out yet and they have an amateur pianist beating on the box.
'I don't understand it because my American is so incomplete.
But it sounds awful.
But don't be angry about it.
Let me be angry for you.
'Do you know what an unsuccessful haberdasher is?'.
'No.
'It is not discreditable.
There are many of them in our country.
There is at least one in every town.
No, Daughter, I am only a fighting soldier and that is the lowest thing on earth.
In that you run for Arlington, if they return the body.
The family has a choice.
'Is Arlington nice?'.
'I don't know,' the Colonel said.
'I was never buried there.
'Where would you like to be buried?'.
'Up in the hills,' he said, making a quick decision.
'On any part of the high ground where we beat them.
'I suppose you should be buried on the Grappa.
'On the dead angle of any shell-pocked slope if they would graze cattle over me in the summer time.
'Do they have cattle there?'.
'Sure.
They always have cattle where there is good grass in the summer, and the girls of the highest houses, the strong built ones, the houses and the girls, that resist the snow in winter, trap foxes in the fall after they bring the cattle down.
They feed from pole-stacked hay.
'And you don't want Arlington or Père Lachaise or what we have here?'.
'Your miserable boneyard.
'I know it is the most unworthy thing about the town.
The city rather.
I learned to call cities towns from you.
But I will see that you go where you wish to go and I will go with you if you like.
'I would not like.
That is the one thing we do alone.
Like going to the bathroom.
'Please do not be rough.
'I meant that I would love to have you with me.
But it is very egotistical and an ugly process.
He stopped, and thought truly, but off-key, and said, 'No.
You get married and have five sons and call them all Richard.
'The lion-hearted,' the girl said, accepting the situation without even a glance, and playing what there was she held as you put down all the cards, having counted exactly.
'The louse-hearted,' the Colonel said.
'The unjust bitter criticizer who speaks badly of everyone.
'Please don't be rough in talking,' the girl said.
'And remember you speak worst of all about yourself.
But hold me as close as we can and let's think about nothing.
He held her as close as he could and he tried to think about nothing.
Chapter XXX.
The colonel and the girl lay quietly on the bed and the Colonel tried to think of nothing; as he had thought of nothing so many times in so many places.
But it was no good now.
It would not work any more because it was too late.
They were not Othello and Desdemona, thank God, although it was the same town and the girl was certainly better looking than the Shakespearean character, and the Colonel had fought as many, or more times than the garrulous Moor.
They are excellent soldiers, he thought.
The damned Moors.
But how many of them have we killed in my time? I think we killed more than a generation if you count the final Moroccan campaign against Abdel Krim.
And each one you have to kill separately.
Nobody ever killed them in mass, as we killed Krauts before they discovered Einheit.
'Daughter,' he said.
'Do you want me to really tell you, so you will know, if I am not rough telling it?'.
'I would rather have you tell me than anything.
Then we can share it.
'It cuts pretty thin for sharing,' the Colonel said.
'It's all yours, Daughter.
And it's only the high-lights.
You wouldn't understand the campaigns in detail, and few others would.
Rommel might.
But they always had him under wraps in France and, besides, we had destroyed his communications.
The two tactical air-forces had; ours and the R.
But I wish I could talk over certain things with him.
I'd like to talk with him and with Ernst Udet.
'Just tell me what you wish and take this glass of Valpolicella and stop if it makes you feel badly.
Or don't tell it at all.
'I was a spare-parts Colonel at the start,' the Colonel explained carefully.
'They are hang-around Colonels, which are given to a Division Commander to replace one that he may have killed, or that is relieved.
Almost none are killed; but many are relieved.
All the good ones are promoted.
Fairly fast when the thing starts to move sort of like a forest fire.
'Go on, please.
Should you take your medicine?'.
'The hell with my medicine,' the Colonel said.
'And the hell with SHAEF.
'You explained that to me,' the girl said.
'I wish the hell you were a soldier with your straight true brain and your beauty memory.
'I would wish to be a soldier if I could fight under you.
'Never fight under me,' the Colonel said.
'I'm cagey.
But I'm not lucky.
Napoleon wanted them lucky and he was right.
'We've had some luck.
'Yes,' the Colonel said.
'Good and bad.
'But it was all luck.
'Sure,' the Colonel said.
'But you can't fight on luck.
It is just something that you need.
The people who fought on luck are all gloriously dead like Napoleon's horse cavalry.
'Why do you hate cavalry? Almost all the good boys I know were in the three good regiments of cavalry, or in the navy.
'I don't hate anything, Daughter,' the Colonel said, and drank a little of the light, dry, red wine which was as friendly as the house of your brother, if you and your brother are good friends.
'I only have a point of view, arrived at after careful consideration, and an estimate of their capabilities.
'Are they not really good?'.
'They are worthless,' the Colonel said.
Then remembering to be kind, added, 'In our time.
'Every day is a disillusion.
'No.
Every day is a new and fine illusion.
But you can cut out everything phoney about the illusion as though you would cut it with a straight-edge razor.
'Please never cut me.
'You're not cut-able.
'Would you kiss me and hold me tight, and we both look at the Grand Canal where the light is lovely now, and you tell me more?'.
When they were looking out at the Grand Canal where the light was, indeed, lovely, the Colonel went on, 'I got a regiment because the Commanding General relieved a boy that I had known since he was eighteen years old.
He was not a boy any more, of course.
It was too much regiment for him and it was all the regiment I ever could have hoped for in this life until I lost it.
' He added, 'Under orders, of course.
'How do you lose a regiment?'.
'When you are working around to get up on the high ground and all you would have to do is send in a flag, and they would talk it over and come out if you were right.
The professionals are very intelligent and these Krauts were all professionals; not the fanatics.
The phone rings and somebody calls from Corps who has his orders from Army or maybe Army Group or maybe even SHAEF, because they read the name of the town in a newspaper, possibly sent in from Spa, by a correspondent, and the order is to take it by assault.
It's important because it got into the newspapers.
You have to take it.
'So you leave one company dead along a draw.
You lose one company complete and you destroy three others.
The tanks get smacked even as fast as they could move and they could move fast both ways.
'They hit them one, two, three, four, five.
'Three men usually get out of the five (that are inside) and they run like broken-field runners that have been shaken loose in a play when you are in Minnesota and the others are Beloit, Wisconsin.
'Do I bore you?'.
'No.
I do not understand the local allusions.
But you can explain them when you care to.
Please keep on telling me.
'You get into the town, and some handsome jerk puts an air mission on you.
This mission might have been ordered and never cancelled.
Let's give everyone the benefit of the doubt.
I'm just telling you about things in a general way.
It is better not to be specific and a civilian wouldn't understand it.
Not even you.
'This air mission does not help much, Daughter.
Because maybe you cannot stay in the town because you have got too few people in, and by now, you are digging them out of rubble; or leaving them in rubble.
There are two schools of thought on that.
So they say to take it by assault.
They repeat this.
'This has been rigidly confirmed by some politician in uniform who has never killed in his life, except with his mouth over the telephone, or on paper, nor ever has been hit.
Figure him as our next President if you want him.
Figure him any way you like.
But figure him and his people, the whole great business establishment, so far back that the best way to communicate with them rapidly would be by racing carrier pigeons.
Except, with the amount of security they maintained for their proper persons, they would probably have their anti-aircraft shoot the pigeons down.
If they could hit them.
'So you do it again.
Then I will tell you what it looks like.
The Colonel looked up at the play of the light on the ceiling.
It was reflected, in part, from the Canal.
It made strange, but steady movements, changing, as the current of a trout stream changes, but remaining, still changing as the sun moved.
Then he looked at his great beauty, with her strange, dark, grown-up child's face that broke his heart, that he would be leaving before 1335 (that was sure) and he said, 'Let's not talk about the war, Daughter.
'Please,' she said.
'Please.
Then I will have it all this week.
'That's a short sentence.
I mean using the word sentence as a jail sentence.
'You don't know how long a week can be when you are nineteen.
'Several times I have known how long an hour can be,' the Colonel said.
'I could tell you how long two minutes and a half can be.
'Please tell me.
'Well, I had two days' leave in Paris between the Schnee-Eifel fight and this one, and due to my friendship with one or two people I was privileged to be present at some sort of a meeting, where only the accredited and trusted were present, and General Walter Bedell Smith explained to all of us how easy the operation that later took the name of Hurtgen Forest would be.
It was not really Hurtgen Forest.
That was only a small sector.
It was the Stadtswald and it was where the German High Command had figured, exactly, to fight after Aachen had been taken and the road into Germany breached.
I hope I am not boring you.
'You never bore me.
Nothing about fighting bores me except lies.
'You're a strange girl.
'Yes,' she said.
'I've known that for quite a long time.
'Would you really like to fight?'.
'I don't know if I could do it.
But I could try if you taught me.
'I'll never teach you.
I'll just tell you anecdotes.
'Sad stories of the death of kings.
'No.
GIs somebody christened them.
God how I hate that word and how it was used.
Comic book readers.
All from some certain place.
Most of them there unwillingly.
Not all.
But they all read a paper called "The Stars and Stripes" and you had to get your unit into it, or you were unsuccessful as a commander.
I was mostly unsuccessful.
I tried to like the correspondents and there were some very good ones present at this meeting.
I will not name names because I might omit some fine ones and that would be unjust.
There were good ones that I don't remember.
Then, there were draft dodgers, phonies who claimed that they were wounded if a piece of spent metal ever touched them, people who wore the purple heart from jeep accidents, insiders, cowards, liars, thieves and telephone racers.
There were a few deads missing from this briefing.
They had deads too.
A big percentage.
But none of the deads were present as I said.
They had women at it though in wonderful uniforms.
'But how did you ever marry one?'.
'By mistake as I explained before.
'Go on and tell me.
'There were more maps in the room than Our Lord could read on his best day,' the Colonel continued.
'There were the Big Picture, the Semi-Big Picture and the Super-Big-Picture.
All these people pretended to understand them, as did the boys with the pointers, a sort of half-arsed billiard cue that they used for explanation.
'Don't say rough words.
I don't know, even, what half-arsed means.
'Shortened, or abbreviated in an inefficient manner,' the Colonel explained.
'Or deficient as an instrument, or in character.
It's an old word.
You could probably find it in Sanscrit.
'Please tell me.
'What for? Why should I perpetuate ignominy just with my mouth?'.
'I'll write it if you want.
I can write truly what I hear or think.
I would make mistakes of course.
'You are a lucky girl if you can write truly what you hear or think.
But don't you ever write one word of this.
He resumed, 'The place is full of correspondents dressed according to their taste.
Some are cynical and some are extremely eager.
'To ride herd on them, and to wield the pointers, there is a group of pistol-slappers.
We call a pistol-slapper a non-fighting man, disguised in uniform, or you might even call it costume, who gets excited every time the weapon slaps against his thighs.
Incidentally, Daughter, the weapon, not the old pistol, the real pistol, has missed more people in combat than probably any weapon in the world.
Don't ever let anyone give you one unless you want to hit people on the head with it in Harry's Bar.
'I never wanted to hit anyone; except perhaps Andrea.
'If you ever hit Andrea, hit him with the barrel; not with the butt.
The butt is awfully slow, and it misses and if it lands you get blood on your hands when you put the gun away.
Also please do not ever hit Andrea because he is my friend.
I do not think he would be easy to hit either.
'No.
I do not think so either.
Please tell me some more about the meeting, or the assembly.
I think I could recognize a pistol-slapper now.
But I would like to be checked out more thoroughly.
'Well, the pistol-slappers, in all the pride of their pistol-slappery, were awaiting the arrival of the great General who was to explain the operation.
'The correspondents were muttering, or twittering, and the intelligent ones were glum or passively cheerful.
Everybody sat on folding chairs as for a Chautauqua lecture.
I'm sorry about these local terms; but we are a local people.
'In comes the General.
He is no pistol-slapper, but a big business man; an excellent politician, the executive type.
The Army is the biggest business, at that moment, in the world.
He takes the half-assed pointer, and he shows us, with complete conviction, and without forebodings, exactly what the attack will be, why we are making it, and how facilely it will succeed.
There is no problem.
'Go on,' the girl said.
'Please let me fill your glass and you, please look at the light on the ceiling.
'Fill it and I'll look at the light and I will go on.
'This high pressure salesman, and I say this with no disrespect, but with admiration for all his talents, or his talent, also told what we would have of the necessary.
There would be no lack of anything.
The organization called SHAEF was then based on a town named Versailles outside of Paris.
We would attack to the east of Aachen a distance of some 380 kilometres from where they were based.
'An army can get to be huge; but you can close up a little bit.
They finally went as far forward as Rheims which was 240 kilometres from the fighting.
That was many months later.
'I understand the necessity of the big executive being removed from contact with his working people.
I understand about the size of the army and the various problems.
I even understand logistics which is not difficult.
But no one ever commanded from that far back in history.
'Tell me about the town.
'I'll tell you,' the Colonel said.
'But I don't want to hurt you.
'You never hurt me.
We are an old town and we had fighting men, always.
We respect them more than all others and I hope we understand them a little.
We also know they are difficult.
Usually, as people, they are very boring to women.
'Do I bore you?'.
'What do you think?' the girl asked.
'I bore myself, Daughter.
'I don't think you do, Richard, you would not have done something all your life if you were bored by it.
Don't lie to me, please, darling, when we have so little time.
'I won't.
'Don't you see you need to tell me things to purge your bitterness?'.
'I know I tell them to you.
'Don't you know I want you to die with the grace of a happy death? Oh, I'm getting all mixed up.
Don't let me get too mixed up.
'I won't, Daughter.
'Tell me some more, please, and be just as bitter as you want.
Chapter XXXI.
'Listen, Daughter,' the Colonel said.
'Now we will cut out all references to glamour and to high brass, even from Kansas, where the brass grows higher than osage-orange trees along your own road.
It bears a fruit you can't eat and it is purely Kansan.
Nobody but Kansans ever had anything to do with it; except maybe us who fought.
We ate them every day.
Osage oranges,' he added.
'Only we called them K Rations.
They weren't bad.
C Rations were bad.
Ten in ones were good.
'So we fought.
It is dull but it is informative.
This is the way it goes if anyone is ever interested; which I doubt.
'It goes like this: 1300 Red S-3: White jumped off in time.
Red said they were waiting to tie in behind White.
1305 (that is one o'clock and five minutes after in the afternoon, if you can remember that, Daughter) Blue S-3, you know what an S-3 is, I hope, says, "Let us know when you move.
" Red said they were waiting to tie in behind White.
'You can see how easy it is,' the Colonel told the girl.
'Everybody ought to do it before breakfast.
'We cannot all be combat infantrymen,' the girl told him softly.
'I respect it more than anything except good, honest fliers.
Please talk, I'm taking care of you.
'Good fliers are very good and should be respected as such,' the Colonel said.
He looked up at the light on the ceiling and he was completely desperate at the remembrance of his loss of his battalions, and of individual people.
He could never hope to have such a regiment, ever.
He had not built it.
He had inherited it.
But, for a time, it had been his great joy.
Now every second man in it was dead and the others nearly all were wounded.
In the belly, the head, the feet or the hands, the neck, the back, the lucky buttocks, the unfortunate chest and the other places.
Tree burst wounds hit men where they would never be wounded in open country.
And all the wounded were wounded for life.
'It was a good regiment,' he said.
'You might even say it was a beautiful regiment until I destroyed it under other people's orders.
'But why do you have to obey them when you know better?'.
'In our army you obey like a dog,' the Colonel explained.
'You always hope you have a good master.
'What kind of masters do you get?'.
'I've only had two good ones so for.
After I reached a certain level of command, many nice people, but only two good masters.
'Is that why you are not a General now? I would love it if you were a General.
'I'd love it too,' the Colonel said.
'But maybe not with the same intensity.
'Would you try to sleep, please, to please me?'.
'Yes,' the Colonel said.
'You see, I thought that if you slept you might get rid of them, just being asleep.
'Yes.
Thank you very much,' he said.
There was nothing to it, gentlemen.
All a man need ever do is obey.
Chapter XXXII.
'You slept quite well for a time,' the girl told him, lovingly and gently.
'Is there anything you would like me to do?'.
'Nothing,' the Colonel said.
'Thank you.
Then he turned bad and he said, 'Daughter, I could sleep good straight up and down in the electric chair with my pants slit and my hair clipped.
I sleep as, and when, I need it.
'I can never be like that,' the girl said, sleepily.
'I sleep when I am sleepy.
'You're lovely,' the Colonel told her.
'And you sleep better than anyone ever slept.
'I am not proud of it,' the girl said, very sleepily.
'It is just something that I do.
'Do it, please.
'No.
Tell me very low and soft and put your bad hand in mine.
'The hell with my bad hand,' the Colonel said.
'Since when was it so bad?'.
'It's bad,' the girl said.
'Badder, or worse, than you will ever know.
Please tell me about combat without being too brutal.
'An easy assignment,' the Colonel said.
'I'll skip the times.
The weather is cloudy and the place is 986342.
What's the situation? We are smoking the enemy with artillery and mortar.
S-3 advises that S-6 wants Red to button up by 1700.
S-6 wants you to button up and use plenty of artillery.
White reports that they are in fair shape.
S-6 informs that A company will swing around and tie in with B.
'B Company was stopped first by enemy action and stayed there of their own accord.
S-6 isn't doing so good.
This is unofficial.
He wants more artillery but there isn't any more artillery.
'You wanted combat for what? I don't know really why.
Or really know why.
Who wants true combat? But here it is, Daughter, on the telephone and later I will put in the sounds and smells and anecdotes about who was killed when and where if you want them.
'I only want what you will tell me.
'I'll tell you how it was,' the Colonel said, 'and General Walter Bedell Smith doesn't know how it was yet.
Though, probably, I am wrong, as I have been so many times.
'I'm glad we don't have to know him or the nylon-smooth man,' the girl said.
'We won't have to know them this side of hell,' the Colonel assured her.
'And I will have a detail guarding the gates of hell so that no such characters enter.
'You sound like Dante,' she said sleepily.
'I am Mister Dante,' he said.
'For the moment.
And for a while he was and he drew all the circles.
They were as unjust as Dante's but he drew them.
Chapter XXXIII.
'I will skip the detailed part since you are, justifiably, and should be, sleepy,' the Colonel said.
He watched, again, the strange play of the light on the ceiling.
Then he looked at the girl, who was more beautiful than any girl that he had ever seen, ever.
He had seen them come and go, and they go faster, when they go, than any other thing that flies.
They can go faster from fair beauty to the knocker's shop than any other animal, he thought.
But I believe that this one could hold the pace and stay the course.
The dark ones last the best, he thought, and looked at the bony structure in that face.
This one has a fine blood line too, and she can go for ever.
Most of our own lovely beauties come from soda counters, and they do not know their grandfather's last name, unless, maybe, it was Schultz.
Or Schlitz, he thought.
This is the wrong attitude to take, he said to himself; since he did not wish to express any of these sentiments to the girl, who would not like them anyway, and was soundly sleepy now the way a cat is when it sleeps within itself.
'Sleep well, my dearest lovely, and I will just tell it for nothing.
The girl was asleep, still holding his bad hand, that he despised, and he could feel her breathe, as the young breathe when they are easily asleep.
The Colonel told her all about it; but he did not utter it.
So after I had the privilege of hearing General Walter Bedell Smith explain the facility of the attack, we made it.
There was the Big Red One, who believed their own publicity.
There was the Ninth, which was a better Division than we were.
There was us, who had always done it when they asked for you to do it.
We had no time to read comic books, and we had no time for practically nothing, because we always moved before first light.
This is difficult and you have to throw away the Big Picture and be a division.
We wore a four-leaf clover, which meant nothing except among ourselves, who all loved it.
And every time I ever see it the same thing happens in my inner guts.
Some people thought that it was ivy.
But it was not.
It was a four-leaf clover disguised as ivy.
The orders were that we would attack with the Big Red One, the First Infantry Division of the Army of the United States, and they, and their Calypso singing PRO never let you forget it.
He was a nice guy.
And it was his job.
But you get fed up with horse-dung unless you like the aroma or the taste.
I never liked it.
Although I loved to walk through cow-dung when I was a kid and feel it between my toes.
But horse-dung bores you.
It bores me very rapidly, and I can detect it at over one thousand yards.
So we attacked, the three of us in line, exactly where the Germans wished us to attack.
We will not mention General Walter Bedell Smith any further.
He is not the villain.
He only made the promises and explained how it would go.
There are no villains, I presume, in a Democracy.
He was only just as wrong as hell.
Period, he added in his mind.
The patches had all been removed even as far back as the rear echelon so that no Kraut would know that it was us, the three he knew so well, who were going to attack.
We were going to attack with the three of us in line and nothing in reserve.
I won't try to explain what that means, Daughter.
But it isn't any good.
And the place we were going to fight in, which I had taken a good look at, was going to be Passchendaele with tree bursts.
I say that too much.
But I think it too much.
The poor bloody twenty-eighth which was up on our right had been bogged down for some time and so there was pretty accurate information available about what conditions in those woods were going to be like.
I think we could conservatively describe them as unfavourable.
Then we were ordered to commit one regiment before the attack started.
That means that the enemy will get at least one prisoner which makes all the taking off of the Divisional patches silly.
They would be waiting for the old four-leaf clover people who would go straight to hell like a mule and do it for one hundred and five days.
Figures of course mean nothing to civilians.
Nor to the characters from SHAEF we never saw in those woods.
Incidentally, and of course these occurrences are always incidental at the SHAEF level, the regiment was destroyed.
It was no one's bloody fault, especially not the fault of the man who commanded it.
He was a man I would be glad to spend half my time in hell with; and may yet.
It certainly would be odd if instead of going to hell, as we always counted on, we should go to one of those Kraut joints like Valhalla and not be able to get along with the people.
But maybe we could get a corner table with Rommel and Udet and it would be just like any winter-sports hotel.
It will probably be hell though and I don't even believe in hell.
Well anyway this regiment was rebuilt as American regiments always are by the replacement system.
I won't describe it since you can always read about it in a book by somebody who was a replacement.
It boils down, or distils, to the fact you stay in until you are hit badly or killed or go crazy and get section-eighted.
But I guess it is logical and as good as any other, given the difficulties of transport.
However it leaves a core of certain un-killed characters who know what the score is and no one of these characters liked the look of these woods much.
You could sum up their attitude In this phrase, 'Don't —— me, Jack.
And since I had been an un-killed character for around twenty-eight years I could understand their attitude.
But they were soldiers, so most of them got killed in those woods and when we took the three towns that looked so innocent and were really fortresses.
They were just built to tempt us and we had no word on them at all.
To continue to use the silly parlance of my trade: this could or could not be faulty intelligence.
'I feel terribly about the regiment,' the girl said.
She had wakened and spoken straight from sleep.
'Yes,' said the Colonel.
'So do I.
Let's drink to it once.
Then you go to sleep, Daughter, please.
The war is over and forgotten.
Please don't think that I am conceited, Daughter, he said, without speaking.
His true love was sleeping again.
She slept in a different way than his career girl had slept.
He did not like to remember how the career girl slept, yet he did.
But he wanted to forget it.
She did not sleep pretty, he thought.
Not like this girl who slept as though she were awake and alive; except she was asleep.
Please sleep well, he thought.
Who the hell are you to criticize career girls? he thought.
What miserable career did you attempt and have failed at?.
I wished to be, and was, a General Officer in the Army of the United States.
I have failed and I speak badly of all who have succeeded.
Then his contrition did not last, and he said to himself, 'Except the brown-nosers, the five and ten and twenty percenters and all the jerks from wherever who never fought and hold commands.
They killed several men from the Academy at Gettysburg.
That was the big kill day of all kill days, when there was a certain amount of opposition by both sides.
Don't be bitter.
They killed General McNair by mistake the day the Valhalla Express came over.
Quit being bitter.
People from the Academy were killed and there are statistics to prove it.
How can I remember if I am not bitter?.
Be as bitter as you want.
And tell the girl, now silently, and that will not hurt her, ever, because she is sleeping so lovely.
He said lovely to himself since his thinking was often un-grammatical.
Chapter XXXIV.
Sleep softly, my true love, and when you wake, this will be over and I will joke you out of trying to learn details of the triste metier of war and we will go to buy the little negro, or moor, carved in ebony with his fine features and his jewelled turban.
Then you will pin him on and we will go to have a drink at Harry's and see whoever or whatever of our friends that will be afoot at that hour.
We will lunch at Harry's, or we'll come back here and I will be packed.
We will say good-bye and I will get into the motoscafo with Jackson and make some cheerful crack to the Gran Maestro and wave to any other members of the Order and ten to one, the way I feel right now, or two will get you thirty, we will not ever see one another again.
Hell, he said to no one and certainly not aloud, I've felt this way before many fights and almost always at some time in the fall of the year and always when leaving Paris.
Probably it doesn't mean a thing.
Who gives a damn anyway except me and the Gran Maestro and this girl; I mean at command level.
I give very much of a damn myself.
But I certainly should be trained and adjusted by this time not to give a much for nothing; like the definition of a whore.
A woman who does not, etc.
But we won't think about that boy, lieutenant, captain, major, colonel, general, sir.
We will just lay it on the line once more and the hell with it and with its ugly face that old Hieronymus Bosch really painted.
But you can sheathe your scythe, old brother death, if you have got a sheath for it.
Or, he added, thinking of Hurtgen now, you can take your scythe and stick it.
It was Passchendaele with tree bursts, he told nobody except the wonder light on the ceiling.
Then he looked at the girl, to see that she was sleeping well enough so even his thoughts would not hurt her.
Then he looked at the portrait and he thought, I have her in two positions, lying down, turned a little on her side and looking at me straight in front.
I'm a lucky son of a bitch and I should never be sad about anything.
Chapter XXXV.
The first day there, we lost the three battalion commanders.
One killed in the first twenty minutes and the other two hit later.
This is only a statistic to a journalist.
But good battalion commanders have never yet grown on trees; not even Christmas trees which was the basic tree of that woods.
I do not know how many times we lost company commanders how many times over.
But I could look it up.
They aren't made, nor grown, as fast as a crop of potatoes is either.
We got a certain amount of replacements but I can remember thinking that it would be simpler and more effective, to shoot them in the area where they de-trucked, than to have to try to bring them back from where they would be killed and bury them.
It takes men to bring them back and gasoline and men to bury them.
These men might just as well be fighting and get killed too.
There was snow, or something, rain or fog, all the times and the roads had been mined as many as fourteen mines deep in certain stretches, so when the vehicles churned down to a new string deeper, in another part of the mud, you were always losing vehicles and, of course, the people that went with them.
Besides just mortaring it all to hell and having all the fire-lanes taped for machine-gun and automatic weapon fire, they had the whole thing worked out and canalized so however you out-thought them you ran right into it.
They also shelled you with heavy artillery fire and with at least one railway gun.
It was a place where it was extremely difficult for a man to stay alive even if all he did was be there.
And we were attacking all the time and every day.
Let's not think about it.
The hell with it.
Maybe two things I will think about and get rid of them.
One was a bare-assed piece of hill that you had to cross to get into Grosshau.
Just before you had to make this run, which was under observation with fires by 88s, there was a little piece of dead ground where they could only hit you with a howitzer, only interdicting fires, or, from the right by mortar.
When we cleaned it up we found they had good observation for their mortars there too.
This was a comparatively safe place, I'm really not lying, not me nor anybody eke.
You can't fool those that were in Hurtgen and if you lied they would know it the minute you opened your mouth, Colonel or no Colonel.
We met a truck at this place and slowed up, and he had the usual grey face and he said, 'Sir, there is a dead G.
in the middle of the road up ahead and every time any vehicle goes through they have to run over him and I'm afraid it is making a bad impression on the troops.
'We'll get him off the road.
So we got him off the road.
And I can remember just how he felt, lifting him, and how he had been flattened and the strangeness of his flatness.
Then there was one other thing, I remember.
We had put an awful lot of white phosphorus on the town before we got in for good, or whatever you would call it.
That was the first time I ever saw a German dog eating a roasted German Kraut.
Later on I saw a cat working on him too.
It was a hungry cat, quite nice looking, basically.
You wouldn't think a good German cat would eat a good German soldier, would you, Daughter? Or a good German dog eat a good German soldier's ass which had been roasted by white phosphorus.
How many could you tell like that? Plenty, and what good would they do? You could tell a thousand and they would not prevent war.
People would say we are not fighting the Krauts and besides the cat did not eat me nor my brother Gordon, because he was in the Pacific.
Maybe land crabs ate Gordon.
Or maybe he just deliquesced.
In Hurtgen they just froze up hard; and it was so cold they froze up with ruddy faces.
Very strange.
They all were grey and yellow like wax-works, in the summer.
But once the winter really came they had ruddy faces.
Real soldiers never tell anyone what their own dead looked like, he told the portrait.
And I'm through with this whole subject.
And what about that company dead up the draw? What about them, professional soldier?.
They're dead, he said.
And I can hang and rattle.
Now who would join me in a glass of Valpolicella? What time do you think I should wake your opposite number, you girl? We have to get to that jewellery place.
And I look forward to making jokes and to talking of the most cheerful things.
What's cheerful, portrait? You ought to know.
You're smarter than I am, although you haven't been around as much.
All right, canvas girl, the Colonel told her, not saying it aloud, we'll drop the whole thing and in eleven minutes I will wake the live girl up and we will go out on the town and be cheerful and leave you here to be wrapped.
I didn't mean to be rude.
I was just joking roughly.
I don't wish to be rude ever because I will be living with you from now on.
I hope, he added, and drank a glass of the wine.
Chapter XXXVI.
It was a sharp, cold bright day and they stood outside the window of the jeweller's shop and studied the two small negro heads and torsos that were carved to ebony and adorned with studded jewels.
One was as good as the other, the Colonel thought.
'Which do you like the best, Daughter?'.
'I think the one on the right.
Don't you think he has the nicer face?'.
'They both have nice faces.
But I think I would rather have him attend you if it was the old days.
'Good.
We'll take him.
Let's go in and see them.
I must ask the price.
'I will go in.
'No, let me ask the price.
They will charge me less than they would charge you.
After all you are a rich American.
'Et toi, Rimbaud?'.
'You'd make an awfully funny Verlalne,' the girl told him.
'We'll be some other famous characters.
'Go on to, Majesty, and we'll buy the God-damn jewel.
'You wouldn't make a very good Louis XVI either.
'I'd get up to that tumbril with you and still be able to spit.
'Let's forget all the tumbrils and everyone's sorrows and buy the small object and then we can walk to Cipriani's and be famous people.
Inside the shop they looked at the two heads and she asked the price and then, there was some very rapid talk and the price was much lower.
But still it was more money than the Colonel had.
'I'll go to Cipriani's and get some money.
'No,' the girl said.
Then to the clerk, 'Put it in a box and send it to Cipriani's and say the Colonel said to pay for it and hold it for him.
'Please,' the clerk said.
'Exactly as you say.
They went out into the street and the sunlight and the unremitting wind.
'By the way,' the Colonel said.
'Your stones are in the safe at the Gritti in your name.
'Your stones.
'No,' he told her, not rough, but to make her understand truly.
'There are some things that a person cannot do.
You know about that.
You cannot marry me and I understand that, although I do not approve it.
'Very well,' the girl said.
'I understand.
But would you take one for a lucky stone?'.
'No.
I couldn't.
They are too valuable.
'But the portrait has value.
'That is different.
'Yes,' she agreed.
'I suppose so.
I think I begin to understand.
'I would accept a horse from you, if I was poor and young and riding very well.
But I could not take a motor car.
'I understand it now very well.
Where can we go now, at this minute, where you can kiss me?'.
'In this side alley, if you know no one who lives in it.
'I don't care who lives in it.
I want to feel you hold me tight and kiss me.
They turned into the side street and walked towards its blind end.
'Oh, Richard,' she said.
'Oh, my dear.
'I love you.
'Please love me.
'I do.
The wind had blown her hair up and around his neck and he kissed her once more with it beating silkily against both his cheeks.
Then she broke away, suddenly and hard, and looked at him and said, 'I suppose we had better go to Harry's.
'I suppose so.
Do you want to play historical personages?'.
'Yes,' she said.
'Let us play that you are you and I am me.
'Let's play,' the Colonel said.
Chapter XXXVII.
There was no one in Harry's except some early morning drinkers that the Colonel did not know and two men that were doing business at the back of the bar.
There were hours at Harry's when it filled with the people that you knew, with the same rushing regularity as the tide coming in at Mont St.
Michel.
Except, the Colonel thought, the hours of the tides change each day with the moon and the hours at Harry's are as the Greenwich Meridian, or the standard metre in Paris, or the good opinion the French military hold of themselves.
'Do you know any of these morning drinkers?' he asked the girl.
'No.
I am not a morning drinker so I have never met them.
'They will be swept out when the tide comes in.
'No.
They will leave, just as it comes, of their own accord.
'Do you mind being here out of season?'.
'Did you think I was a snob because I come from an old family? We're the ones who are not snobs.
The snobs are what you call jerks and the people with all the new money.
Did you ever see so much new money?'.
'Yes,' the Colonel said.
'I saw it in Kansas City when I used to come in from Fort Riley to play polo at the Country Club.
'Was it as bad as here?'.
'No, it was quite pleasant.
I liked it and that part of Kansas City is very beautiful.
'Is it really? I wish that we could go there.
Do they have the camps there too? The ones that we are going to stay at?'.
'Surely.
But we'll stay at the Muehlebach hotel which has the biggest beds in the world and we'll pretend that we are oil millionaires.
'Where will we leave the Cadillac?'.
'Is it a Cadillac now?'.
'Yes.
Unless you want to take the big Buick Roadmaster, with the Dynaflow drive.
I've driven it all over Europe.
It was in that last Vogue you sent me.
'We'd probably better just use one at a time,' the Colonel said.
'Whichever one we decide to use we will park in the garage alongside the Muehlebach.
'Is the Muehlebach very splendid?'.
'Wonderful.
You'll love it.
When we leave town we'll drive north to St.
Joe and have a drink in the bar at the Roubidoux, maybe two drinks and then we will cross the river and go west.
You can drive and we can spell each other.
'What is that?'.
'Take turns driving.
'I'm driving now.
'Let's skip the dull part and get to Chimney Rock and go on to Scott's Bluff and Torrington and after that you will begin to see it.
'I have the road maps and the guides and that man who says where to eat and the A.
guide to the camps and the hotels.
'Do you work on this much?'.
'I work at it in the evenings, with the things you sent me.
What kind of a licence will we have?'.
'Missouri.
We'll buy the car in Kansas City.
We fly to Kansas City, don't you remember? Or we can go on a really good train.
'I thought we flew to Albuquerque.
'That was another time.
'Will we stop early in the afternoons at the best Hotel in the A.
book and I make you any drinks you want while you read the paper and Life and Time and Newsweek and I will read the new fresh Vogue and Harper's Bazaar?.
'Yes.
But we come back here, too.
'Of course.
With our car.
On an Italian liner; whichever one is best then.
We drive straight here from Genoa.
'You don't want to stop anywhere for the night?'.
'Why? We want to get home to our own house.
'Where will our house be?'.
'We can decide that any time.
There are always plenty of houses in this town.
Would you like to live in the country too?'.
'Yes,' said the Colonel.
'Why not?'.
'Then we could see the trees when we woke up.
What sort of trees will we see on this journey?'.
'Pine mostly and cotton-wood along the creeks and aspen.
Wait till you see the aspen turn yellow in the fall.
'I'm waiting.
Where will we stay in Wyoming?'.
'We'll go to Sheridan first and then decide.
'Is Sheridan nice?'.
'It's wonderful.
In the car we'll drive to where they had the Wagon-Box Fight and I'll tell you about it.
We will drive up, on the way to Billings, to where they killed that fool George Armstrong Custer and you can see the markers where everybody died and I'll explain the fight to you.
'That will be wonderful.
Which is Sheridan more like; Mantova or Verona or Vicenza?'.
'It isn't like any of those.
It is right up against the mountains, almost like Schio.
'Is it like Cortina then?'.
'Nothing like.
Cortina is in a high valley in the mountains.
Sheridan lays right up against them.
There aren't any foothills to the Big Horns.
They rise high out of the plateau.
You can see Cloud's Peak.
'Will our cars climb them properly?'.
'You're damn right they will.
But I would much rather not have any hydromatic drive.
'I can do without it,' the girl said.
Then she held herself straight and hard not to cry.
'As I can do without everything else.
'What are you drinking?' the Colonel said.
'We haven't even ordered yet.
'I don't think I will drink anything.
'Two very dry Martinis,' the Colonel said to the bartender, 'and a glass of cold water.
He reached into his pocket and unscrewed the top of the medicine bottle and shook two of the big tablets into his left hand.
With them in his hand, he screwed the top back on the bottle.
It was no feat for a man with a bad right hand.
'I said I didn't want to drink anything.
'I know, Daughter.
But I thought you might need one.
We can leave it on the bar.
Or I can drink it myself.
Please,' he said.
'I did not mean to be brusque.
'We haven't asked for the little negro that will look after me.
'No.
Because I did not want to ask for him until Cipriani came in and I could pay for him.
'Is everything that rigid?'.
'With me, I guess,' the Colonel said.
'I'm sorry, Daughter.
'Say daughter three times straight.
'Hija, figlia, Daughter.
'I don't know,' she said.
'I think we should just leave here.
I love to have people see us, but I don't want to see anybody.
'The box with the negro in it is on top of the cash register.
'I know.
I've seen it for some time.
The bar-tender came, with the two drinks, frost cold from the chilled coldness of the glasses and he brought the glass of water.
'Give me that small packet that came in my name and is on top of the cash register,' the Colonel said to him.
'Tell Cipriani I will send him a cheque for it.
He had made another decision.
'Do you want your drink, Daughter?'.
'Yes.
If you don't mind me changing my mind too.
They drank, after touching glasses very lightly, so lightly that the contact was almost imperceptible.
'You were right,' she said, feeling its warmth and its momentary destruction of sorrow.
'You were right too,' he said, and palmed the two tablets.
He thought taking them with the water now, was in bad taste.
So, when the girl turned her head a moment to watch a morning drinker go out to the door, he swallowed them with the Martini.
'Should we go, Daughter?'.
'Yes.
By all means.
'Bar-tender,' the Colonel said.
'How much are these drinks? And do not forget to tell Cipriani I am sending him a cheque for this nonsense.
Chapter XXXVIII.
They ate lunch at the Gritti and the girl had unwrapped the small ebony negro's head and torso and pinned it high on her left shoulder.
It was about three inches long and was quite lovely to look at if you liked that sort of thing.
And if you don't you are stupid, the Colonel thought.
But do not even think rough, he told himself.
You have to be good now in every way until you say good-bye.
What a word, he thought, good-bye.
It sounds like a Valentine slogan.
Good-bye and bonne chance and hasta la vista.
We always just said merde and let it go at that.
Farewell, he thought, that is a nice word.
It sings well, he thought.
Farewell, a long farewell and take it with you where you go.
With handles, he thought.
'Daughter,' he said.
'How long has it been since I told you that I loved you?'.
'Not since we sat at the table.
'I tell you now.
She had combed her hair with patience when they came into the hotel and she had gone into the room for women.
She disliked such rooms.
She had used lipstick to make the sort of mouth she knew he most desired and she had said to herself, making the mouth correctly, 'Don't think at all.
Don't think.
Above all don't be sad because he is going now.
'You look beautiful.
'Thank you.
I would like to be beautiful for you if I could and if I could be beautiful.
'Italian is a lovely language.
'Yes.
Mister Dante thought so.
'Gran Maestro,' the Colonel said.
'What is there to eat in this Wirtschaft?'.
The Gran Maestro had been observing, without observing, with affection and without envy.
'Do you want meat, or fish?'.
'It's Saturday,' the Colonel said.
'Fish is not compulsory.
So I'll take it.
'It is sole,' the Gran Maestro said.
'What do you want, my Lady?'.
'Whatever you decide.
You know more about food than I do and I like it all.
'Make a decision, Daughter.
'No.
I would rather leave it to someone who knows more than me.
I have a boarding-school appetite.
'It will come as a surprise,' the Gran Maestro said with his long and loving face with the grey eyebrows over the softly hooded eyes and the ever happy face of the old soldier who is still alive and appreciates it.
'Is there any news from the Order?' the Colonel asked.
'Only that our leader, Himself, is in trouble.
They have confiscated everything he owns.
Or at any rate they have intervened.
'I hope it is not serious.
'We will have confidence in our leader.
He has ridden out worse tempests than this.
'To our leader,' the Colonel said.
He raised his glass, which had been filled with the decanted new and true Valpolicella.
'Drink to him, Daughter.
'I can't drink to that swine,' the girl said.
'Besides I do not belong to the Order.
'You are a member now,' the Gran Maestro said.
'Por merito di guerra.
'I'll drink to him then,' she said.
'Am I really a member of the Order?'.
'Yes,' the Gran Maestro said.
'You have not received your parchment yet but I appoint you Super Honorary Secretary.
My Colonel will reveal to you the secrets of the Order.
Reveal, please, my Colonel.
'I reveal', the Colonel said.
'There are no pitted folk about?'.
'No.
He is out with his Lady.
Miss Baedeker.
then,' the Colonel said.
'I will reveal.
There is only the major secret that you must know.
Correct me, Gran Maestro, if I fall into error.
'Proceed to reveal,' the Gran Maestro said.
'I proceed to reveal,' the Colonel said.
'Listen carefully, Daughter.
This is the Supreme Secret.
Listen.
'Love is love and fun is fun.
But it is always so quiet when the gold fish die.
'It has been revealed,' the Gran Maestro said.
'I am very proud and happy to be a member of the Order,' the girl said.
'But it is, in a way, a rather rough Order.
'It is indeed,' the Colonel said.
'And now, Gran Maestro, what do we actually eat; without mysteries?'.
'Some crab enchillada, in the style of this town, but cold, first.
Served in the shell.
Then sole for you and for my lady a mixed grill.
What vegetables?'.
'Whatever you have,' the Colonel said.
The Gran Maestro was gone and the Colonel looked at the girl and then at the Grand Canal outside the window and he saw the magic spots and changes of light that were even here, in the end of the bar, which had now by skilful handling been made into a dining-room, and he said, 'Did I tell you, Daughter, that I love you?'.
'You haven't told me for quite a long time.
But I love you.
'What happens to people that love each other?'.
'I suppose they have whatever they have and they are more fortunate than others.
Then one of them gets the emptiness for ever.
'I won't be rough,' the Colonel said.
'I could have made a rough response.
But please don't have any emptiness.
'I'll try,' the girl said.
'I've been trying ever since I woke up.
I've tried ever since we knew each other.
'Keep on trying, Daughter,' the Colonel said.
Then to the Grand Maestro, who had reappeared, having given his orders, the Colonel said, 'A bottle of that vino secco, from Vesuvius, for the small soles.
We have the Valpolicella for the other things.
'Can't I drink the Vesuvius wine with my mixed grill?' the girl asked.
'Renata, Daughter,' the Colonel said.
'Of course.
You can do anything.
'I like to drink the same wines as you if I drink wine.
'Good white wine is good with a mixed grill, at your age,' the Colonel told her.
'I wish there was not such a difference in ages.
'I like it very much,' the Colonel said.
'Except,' he added.
Then he did not continue and said, 'Let's be fraîche et rose comme au jour de bataille.
'Who said that?'.
'I haven't the slightest idea.
I picked it up when I took a course at the Collège des Maréchaux.
A rather pretentious title.
But I graduated.
What I know best I learned from the Krauts, studying them and opposing them.
They are the best soldiers.
But they always over-reach.
'Let's be like you said and please tell me that you love me.
'I love you,' he said.
'That's what you can base on.
I tell you truly.
'It is Saturday,' she said.
'And when is next Saturday?'.
'Next Saturday is a movable feast, Daughter.
Find me a man who can tell me about next Saturday.
'You could tell me if you would.
'I'll ask the Gran Maestro, maybe he knows.
Gran Maestro, when will next Saturday come?'.
'A Pâques ou à la Trinité,' the Gran Maestro said.
'Why don't we have any smells from the kitchen to cheer us up?'.
'Because the wind is from the wrong direction.
Yes, the Colonel thought.
The wind is from the wrong direction and how lucky I would have been to have had this girl instead of the woman that I pay alimony to, who could not even make a child.
She hired out for that.
But who should criticize whose tubes? I only criticize Goodrich or Firestone or General.
Keep it clean, he said to himself.
And love your girl.
She was there beside him, wishing to be loved, if he had any love to give.
It came back, as it always had, when he saw her and he said, 'How are you with the crow wing hair and the break-heart face?'.
'I'm fine.
'Gran Maestro,' the Colonel said.
'Produce a few smells or something from your off-stage kitchen, even if the wind is against us.
Chapter XXXIX.
The hall porter had telephoned, under the direction of the concierge, and it was the same motor boat that they had ridden in before.
T5 Jackson was in the boat with the luggage and the portrait, which had been well and sturdily wrapped.
It was still blowing hard.
The Colonel had paid his bill and made the proper tips.
The people of the hotel had put the luggage and the picture in the boat and seen that Jackson was seated properly.
Then they had retired.
'Well, Daughter,' the Colonel said.
'Can't I ride with you to the garage?'.
'It would be just as bad at the garage.
'Please let me ride to the garage.
'All right,' the Colonel said.
'It's your show, really.
Get in.
They did not talk at all and the wind was a stern wind so that, with what speed the old calamity of a motor made, there seemed almost to be no wind at all.
At the landing place, where Jackson was handing the luggage to a porter and looking after the portrait himself, the Colonel said, 'Do you want to say good-bye here?'.
'Do I have to?'.
'No.
'May I come up to the bar in the garage while they are getting the car down?'.
'That will be worse.
'I do not care.
'Get that stuff up to the garage and have somebody look after it until you get the car down,' the Colonel said to Jackson.
'Check on my guns and pack this stuff in a way to give the maximum space in the rear seat.
'Yes, sir,' Jackson said.
'Am I going then?' the girl asked.
'No,' the Colonel told her.
'Why can't I go?'.
'You know very well.
You weren't invited.
'Please don't be bad.
'Christ, Daughter, if you knew how hard I am trying not to be.
It's easy if you're bad.
Let's pay this good man off and go over and sit on the bench there under the tree.
He paid the owner of the motor boat and told him that he had not forgotten about the jeep engine.
He also told him not to count on it, but that there was a good chance that he could get it.
'It will be a used engine.
But it will be better than that coffee pot you have in there now.
They went up the worn stone steps and walked across the gravel and sat on a bench under the trees.
The trees were black and moved in the wind and there were no leaves on them.
The leaves had fallen early that year and been swept up long ago.
A man came over to offer postcards for sale and the Colonel told him, 'Run along, son.
We don't need you now.
The girl was crying, finally, although she had made the decision never to cry.
'Look, Daughter,' the Colonel said.
'There isn't anything to say.
They didn't instal shock-absorbers in this vehicle we ride in now.
'I've stopped,' she said.
'I'm not an hysterical.
'I wouldn't say you were.
I'd say you were the loveliest and most beautiful girl that ever lived.
Any time.
Any place.
Anywhere.
'If it were true, what difference would it make?'.
'You have me there,' the Colonel said.
'But it is true.
'So now what?'.
'So now we stand up and kiss each other and say good-bye.
'What's that?'.
'I don't know,' the Colonel said.
'I guess that is one of the things everybody has to figure out for themselves.
'I'll try to figure it.
'Just take it as easy as you can, Daughter.
'Yes,' the girl said.
'In the vehicle without the shock-absorbers.
'You were tumbril bait from the start.
'Can't you do anything kindly?'.
'I guess not.
But I've tried.
'Please keep on trying.
That's all the hope we have.
'I'll keep on trying.
So they held each other close and kissed each other hard and true and the Colonel took the girl across the stretch of gravel and down the stone steps.
'You ought to take a good one.
Not that old displaced engine boat.
'I'd rather take the displaced engine boat if you don't mind.
'Mind?' the Colonel said.
'Not me.
I only give orders and obey orders.
I don't mind.
Good-bye, my dear, lovely, beautiful.
'Good-bye,' she said.
Chapter XL.
He was in the sunken oak hogshead that they used in the Veneto for blinds.
A blind is any artifice you use to hide the shooter from that which he is attempting to shoot, which, in this case, were ducks.
It had been a good trip out with the boys, once they had met in the garage and a good evening with excellent food cooked on the old open-hearth kitchen.
Three shooters rode in the rear seat, on the way to the shooting place.
Those who did not lie had permitted themselves a certain amount of exaggeration and the liars had never been in fuller flower.
A liar, in full flower, the Colonel had thought, is as beautiful as cherry trees, or apple trees when they are in blossom.
Who should ever discourage a liar, he thought, unless he is giving you co-ordinates?.
The Colonel had collected liars all his life, as some men gather postage stamps.
He did not classify them, except at the moment, nor treasure them truly.
He just enjoyed, completely, hearing them lie at the moment, unless, of course, something concerned with duty was involved.
Last night there had been a fair amount of good lying after the grappa had been passed around and the Colonel had enjoyed it.
There had been smoke in the room from the open charcoal fire; no, there were logs, he thought.
Anyway a liar lies best when there is a little smoke or when the sun has set.
He had come close to lying twice himself and had held it up and merely exaggerated.
I hope anyway, he thought.
Now here was the frozen lagoon to ruin everything.
But it was not ruined.
A pair of pin-tails came, suddenly, from nowhere, slanting down fast in a dive no aeroplane ever made, and the Colonel heard their feathered trajectory and swung and killed the drake.
He lay on the ice, hitting it as solid as a duck can hit ice and, before he was down, the Colonel had killed his mate, who was climbing, long-necked and fast.
She fell alongside the drake.
So it is murder, the Colonel thought.
And what isn't nowadays? But, boy, you can still shoot.
Boy, hell, he thought.
You beat-up old bastard.
But look at them come now.
They were widgeon and they came in a whisp that coagulated and then stretched to nothing.
Then they coagulated again and the treacherous duck on the ice started to talk to them.
Let them turn once more, the Colonel said to himself.
Keep your head down and do not move even your eyes.
They are going to come in.
They came in well, with treachery speaking to them.
Their wings were suddenly set to alight, as when you lower the flaps.
Then they saw it was ice and they rose, climbing.
The shooter, who was not a Colonel now, nor anything but a gun handler, rose in the wooden barrel and got two.
They hit the ice almost as solidly as the big ducks.
Two is enough from one family, the Colonel said.
Or was it one tribe?.
The Colonel heard a shot behind him, where he knew there was no other blind and turned his head to look across the frozen lagoon to the far, sedge-lined shore.
That does it, he thought.
A bunch of mallards, that had been coming in low, were flaring up into the sky, seeming to stand on their tails as they climbed.
He saw one fall, then heard another shot.
It was the sullen boatman shooting at the ducks that would have come to the Colonel.
How, how can he do that? The Colonel thought.
The man had a shot-gun to shoot any cripples that might be escaping where the dog could not get them.
For him to fire at ducks that were coming to the Colonel's blind was, in shooting, as bad a thing as one man could do to another.
The boatman was too far away to hear a shout.
So the Colonel fired at him twice.
It is too far for the pellets to reach, he thought, but at least he will know that I know what he is doing.
What the hell is this all about? On a beautifully run shoot like this one too? This is the best organized and best run duck shoot I have ever shot at and I have had as much fun shooting here as I ever had in my life.
What is the matter with that son of a bitch?.
He knew how bad his anger was for him.
So he took two of the pills and washed them down with a drink of Gordon's gin from his flask since there was no water.
He knew the gin was bad for him too and he thought, everything is bad for me except rest and very light exercise.
, rest and light exercise, boy.
Do you suppose that is light exercise?.
You, beauty, he said to himself.
I wish you were here now and we were in the double blind and if we could only just feel the backs of our shoulders touch.
I'd look around and see you and I would shoot the high ducks well, to show off and try to put one in the blind without having it hit you.
I'd try to pull one down like this, he said, hearing the wings in the air.
He rose, turned, saw the single drake, long-necked and beautiful, the wings fast moving and travelling to the sea.
He saw him sharp and clear and in the sky with the mountains behind him.
He met him, covered him and pulled as he swung as far back as he could swing the gun.
The drake came down on the ice, just outside the perimeter of the blind and broke the ice as he fell.
It was the ice that had been broken to put out the decoys and it had re-frozen lightly.
The calling hen looked at him as he lay and shifted her feet.
'You never saw him before in your life,' the Colonel said to the hen.
'I don't believe you even saw him coming.
Though you may have.
But you didn't say anything.
The drake had hit with his head down and his head was under the ice.
But the Colonel could see the beautiful winter plumage on his breast and wings.
I'd like to give her a vest made of the whole plumage the way the old Mexicans used to ornament their gods, he thought.
But I suppose these ducks have to go to the market and no one would know how to skin and cure the skins anyway.
It could be beautiful, though, with mallard drake skins for the back and sprig for the front with two longitudinal stripes of teal.
One coming down over each breast.
Be a hell of a vest.
I'm pretty sure she'd like it.
I wish they would fly, the Colonel thought.
A few fool ducks might come in.
I have to stay ready for them if they do.
But none came in and he had to think.
There were no shots from the other blinds and only occasional shots from the sea.
With the good light, the birds could see the ice and they no longer came in and instead went out to the open sea to raft up.
So he had no shooting and he thought without intention, trying to find what had made it at the first.
He knew he did not deserve it and he accepted it and he lived by it, but he sought, always, to understand it.
One time it had been two sailors when he had been walking with the girl at night.
They had whistled at her and, the Colonel thought, that was a harmless enough thing and he should have let it go.
But there was something wrong with it.
He sensed it before he knew it.
Then he knew it solidly, because he had stopped under a light, in order that they might see what he wore on his shoulders, so that they might take the other side of the street.
What he wore on each shoulder was a small eagle with wings outstretched.
It was embroidered on to the coat he wore in silver thread.
It was not conspicuous and it had been there a long time.
But it was visible.
The two sailors whistled again.
'Stay over there against the wall if you want to watch it,' the Colonel had said to the girl.
'Or look away.
'They are very big and young.
'They won't be big for long,' the Colonel promised her.
The Colonel walked over to the whistlers.
'Where is your shore patrol?' he asked.
'How would I know?' the biggest whistler said.
'All I want is a good look at the dame.
'Do people like you have names and serial numbers?'.
'How would I know?' said one.
The other said, 'I wouldn't tell a chicken Colonel if I had.
Old army boy, the Colonel thought, before he hit him.
Sea lawyer.
Knows all his rights.
But he hit him with a left from nowhere and hit him three times as he started to go.
The other one, the first whistler, had closed fast and well, for a man who had been drinking, and the Colonel gave him the elbow in the mouth and then, under the light, had a good right hand shot at him.
When it was in, he glanced at the second whistler and saw that was okay.
Then he threw a left hook.
Then he put the right way into the body, coming up.
He threw another left hook and then turned away and walked towards the girl because he did not want to hear the head hit the pavement.
He checked on the one that had it first and noted he slept peacefully, chin down, with the blood coming out of his mouth.
But it was still the right colour, the Colonel noted.
'Well, there goes my career,' he said to the girl.
'Whatever that was.
But those people certainly wear funny pants.
'How are you?' the girl asked.
'I'm fine.
Did you watch it?'.
'Yes.
'I'll have bad hands in the morning,' he said absent mindedly.
'But I think we can walk away from it all right.
But let's walk slowly.
'Please walk slowly.
'I did not mean it that way.
I mean let's not be hurried in our departure.
'We will walk as slowly as two people can walk.
So they walked.
'Do you want to try an experiment?'.
'Of course.
'Let's walk so we make even the backs of our legs look dangerous.
'I'll try.
But I don't think I can.
'Well, let's just walk then.
'But didn't they hit you?'.
'One pretty good right behind the ear.
The second boy when he came in.
'Is that what fighting's like?'.
'When you're lucky.
'And when you're not lucky?'.
'Your knees bend too.
Either forward or backward.
'Do you still care for me after you have fought?'.
'I love you much more than before if it were possible.
'Can't it be possible? It would be nice.
I love you more since I saw that thing.
Am I walking slowly enough?'.
'You walk like a deer in the forest and sometimes you walk as well as a wolf, or an old, big coyote when he is not hurried.
'I'm not sure I wish to be an old big coyote.
'Wait till you see one,' the Colonel said.
'You'll wish.
You walk like all the great predators, when they walk softly.
And you are not a predator.
'That I can promise.
'Walk a little ahead so I can see.
She walked ahead and the Colonel said, 'You walk like a champion before he is the champion.
If you were a horse I would buy you if I had to borrow the money at twenty per cent a month.
'You don't have to buy me.
'I know about that.
That was not what we were discussing.
We were discussing your gait.
'Tell me,' she said.
'What happens to those men? That's one of the things I don't know about fighting.
Shouldn't I have stayed and cared for them?'.
'Never,' the Colonel told her.
'Remember that; never.
I hope they split a good concussion between them.
They can rot.
They caused the accident.
There is no question of civil responsibility.
We were all insured.
If I can tell you one thing, Renata, about fighting.
'Tell me, please.
'If you ever fight, then you must win it.
That's all that counts.
All the rest is cabbage, as my old friend Dr.
Rommel put it.
'Did you really like Rommel?'.
'Very much.
'But he was your enemy.
'I love my enemies, sometimes, more than my friends.
And the Navy, you know, wins all their fights always.
This I learned in a place called the Pentagon building when I was still permitted to enter that building by the front door.
If you like we can stroll back down this street, or walk it fast and ask those two that question.
'I tell you truly, Richard.
I have seen enough fighting for one night.
'Me too, to tell the truth,' the Colonel said.
But he said it in Italian and it started, 'Anche io.
Let's go to Harry's for one, and then I will walk you home.
'Didn't you hurt your bad hand?'.
'No,' he explained.
'I only threw it once to the head.
The other times I punched to the body with it.
'May I feel it?'.
'If you will feel very softly.
'But it is terribly swollen.
'There is nothing broken in it and that sort of swelling always goes down.
'Do you love me?'.
'Yes.
I love you with two moderately swollen hands and all my heart.
Chapter XLI.
So that was that and maybe it was that day or maybe it was another that made the miracle.
You never knew, he thought.
There was the great miracle and he had never consciously implemented it.
Nor, he thought, you son of a bitch, did you ever oppose it.
It was colder than ever and the broken ice re-froze and the calling duck did not even look up now.
She had abandoned treachery for an attempt at security.
You bitch, the Colonel thought.
Though that is unjust.
It is your trade.
But why is it a hen calls better than a drake.
You ought to know, he thought.
And even that's not true.
What the hell is true? Drakes actually call better.
Now don't think of her.
Don't think of Renata because it won't do you any good, boy.
It might even be bad for you.
Also you said good-bye.
What a good-bye that was.
Complete with tumbrils.
And she would have climbed up in the damned tumbril with you too.
Just so long as it was a real tumbril.
Very rough trade, he thought.
Loving and leaving.
People can get hurt at it.
Who gave you a right to know a girl like that?.
Nobody, he answered.
But Andrea introduced me to her.
But how could she love a sad son of a bitch like you?.
I do not know, he thought truly.
I truly do not know.
He did not know, among other things, that the girl loved him because he had never been sad one waking morning of his life; attack or no attack.
He had experienced anguish and sorrow.
But he had never been sad in the morning.
They make almost none like that and the girl, although she was a young girl, knew one when she saw one.
Now she is at home and sleeping, the Colonel thought.
That is where she ought to be and not in any god-damn duck blind with the decoys frozen up on us.
I wish to hell she was here though, if this were a double blind and have her looking to the west just in case one string did come in.
It would be nice if she were warm enough.
Maybe I can trade somebody out of one of these real down jackets that nobody ever sold that had one.
The kind they issued to the Air Force once by mistake.
I could find out how they are quilted and make one with duck down from here, he thought.
I'd get a good tailor to cut it and we would make it double-breasted with no pocket on the right and lay in a chamois shooting patch so the gun butt would never catch.
I'll do it, he said to himself.
I'll do it, or I will get one off some joker and have it cut down for her.
I'd like to get her a good Purdey 12, not too damn light, or a pair of Boss over and unders.
She should have guns as good as she is.
I suppose a pair of Purdey's, he thought.
Just then he heard the light swish of pinions, fast beating in the air, and looked up.
But they were too high.
He only looked up with his eyes.
But they were so high they could see the barrel with him in it and the frozen-in decoys with the dejected hen, who saw them too and quacked hard in her loyal treachery.
The ducks, they were pin-tails, continued on their flight out towards the sea.
I never gave her anything, as she pointed out.
There was the small moor's head.
But it does not mean anything.
She selected it and I bought it.
That is no way to give a gift.
What I would like to give her is security, which does not exist any more; all my love, which is worthless; all my worldly goods, which are practically non-existent except for two good shot-guns, my soldier suits, the medals and decorations with the citations and some books.
Also a retired Colonel's pay.
With all my worldly goods I thee endow, he thought.
And she gave me her love, some hard stones, which I returned, and the picture.
Well, I can always give her back the picture.
I could give her my ring from V.
, he thought, but where the hell did I lose that?.
She wouldn't want a D.
with cluster, nor two silver stars, nor the other junk, nor the medals of her own country.
Nor those of France.
Nor those of Belgium.
Nor the trick ones.
That would be morbid.
I better just give her my love.
But how the hell do you send it? And how do you keep it fresh? They can't pack it in dry ice.
Maybe they can.
I must inquire.
But how do I get that condemned jeep engine to that old man?.
Figure it out, he thought.
Figuring things out has been your trade.
Figuring things out when they were shooting at you, he added.
I wish that son of a bitch that is lousing up the duck shooting had a rifle and I had a rifle.
We would find out pretty soon who could figure things out.
Even in a lousy barrel in a marsh where you can't manoeuvre.
He'd have to come to get me.
Stop that, he said to himself, and think about your girl.
You do not want to kill anyone any more; ever.
Who are you feeding that to, he told himself.
You going to run as a Christian? You might give it an honest try.
She would like you better that way.
Or would she? I don't know, he said frankly.
I honest to God don't know.
Maybe I will get Christian towards the end.
Yes, he said, maybe you will.
Who wants to make a bet on that?.
'You want to bet on that?' he asked the calling duck.
But she was looking up at the sky behind him and had commenced her small chuckling talk.
They came over too high and never circled.
They only looked down and went on towards the open sea.
They must really be rafted up out there, the Colonel thought.
There's probably some punt gunner trying to sneak up on them now.
They will be pretty close into the lee with the wind and someone is sneaking on to them now surely.
Well, when he makes his shot some may break back this way.
But with it frozen-up I suppose I really ought to pull out instead of staying here like a fool.
I have killed enough and I have shot as well or better than I can shoot.
Better hell, he thought.
Nobody shoots better than you here except Alvarito and he's a kid and shoots faster.
But you kill fewer ducks than many bad and fair shots.
Yes, I know about that.
I know about that and why and we don't go by the numbers any more and we threw away the book too, remember?.
He remembered how, by some miracle of chance in a war, he had been with his best friend for a moment in action in the Ardennes and they were pursuing.
It was early fall and it was on a high upland with sandy roads and trails and the trees were scrub oak and pines.
The enemy tank and half track prints showed clearly in the moist sand.
It had rained the day before, but now it was clearing and visibility was good and you could see well across all the high, rolling country and he and his friend were glassing it as carefully as though they were hunting game.
The Colonel, who was a General then and an assistant divisional commander, knew the individual print of each tracked vehicle they were pursuing.
He also knew when the enemy vehicles had run out of mines and approximately the number of rounds that remained to them.
He also had figured where they had to fight before they reached the Siegfried.
He was sure they would not fight at either of these two places but would race for where they were going.
'We're pretty far up for people of our exalted rank, George,' he said to his best friend.
'Ahead of the point, General.
'It's okay,' the Colonel had said.
'Now we throw away the book and chase for keeps.
'I couldn't agree more fully, General.
Because I wrote the book myself,' his best friend said.
'But suppose they had left something there?'.
He pointed to the logical place to defend.
'They didn't leave anything there,' the Colonel had said.
'They haven't enough stuff left even for a fire-fight.
'Everybody's right until he's wrong,' his best friend said, adding, 'General.
'I'm right,' the Colonel said.
He was right, too, although in obtaining his exact knowledge he had not fulfilled the complete spirit of the Geneva Convention which was alleged to govern the operation of war.
'Let's really chase,' his best friend had said.
'There's nothing holding us up and I guarantee they won't stop at either of those two.
I didn't get that from any Kraut either.
That's from my head.
He looked over the country once more, and heard the wind in the trees and smelled the heather under their boots and looked once more at the tracks in the wet sand and that was the end of that story.
I wonder if she'd like that? he thought.
It builds me up too much.
I'd like to get somebody else to tell it to her though and build me solid.
George can't tell it to her.
He's the only one that could tell it to her and he can't.
He sure as hell can't.
I've been right over ninety-five per cent of the time and that's a hell of a batting average even in something as simple as war.
But that five per cent when you are wrong can certainly be something.
I'll never tell you about that, Daughter.
That's just a noise heard off stage in my heart.
My lousy chicken heart.
That bastard heart certainly couldn't hold the pace.
Maybe he will, he thought, and took two of the tablets and a swallow of gin and looked across the grey ice.
I'm going to get that sullen character in now and pick up and get the hell to the farm house or the lodge, I suppose that I should call it.
The shooting's over.
Chapter XLII.
The colonel had signalled the boatman in by standing up, in the sunken barrel, firing two shots towards the empty sky, and then waving him towards the blind.
The boat came in slowly, breaking ice all the way, and the man picked up the wooden decoys, caught the calling hen and put her in her sack, and, with the dog slithering on the ice, picked up the ducks.
The boatman's anger seemed to be gone and to be replaced by a solid satisfaction.
'You shot very few,' he said to the Colonel.
'With your help.
That was all they said and the boatman placed the ducks carefully, breasts up, on the bow of the boat, and the Colonel handed his guns and the combination cartridge box and shooting stool into the boat.
The Colonel got into the boat and the boatman checked the blind and unhooked the pocketed, apron-like device which had hung on the inside of the blind to hold shells.
Then he got into the boat too and they commenced their slow and laborious progress out through the ice to the open water of the brown canal.
The Colonel worked as hard with the poling oar as he had worked coming in.
But now, in the bright sunlight, with the snow mountains to the north, and the line of the sedge that marked the canal ahead of them, they worked together in complete co-ordination.
Then they were into the canal, slipping breakingly in from the last ice; then, suddenly, light-borne and the Colonel handed the big oar to the boatman and sat down.
He was sweating.
The dog, who had been shivering at the Colonel's feet, pawed his way over the gunwale of the boat and swam to the canal bank.
Shaking the water from his white bedraggled coat, he was into the brown sedge and brush, and the Colonel watched his progress towards home by the movement of the brush.
He had never received his sausage.
The Colonel, feeling himself sweating, although he knew he was protected from the wind by his field jacket, took two tablets from the bottle and a sip of gin from his flask.
The flask was flat and of silver with a leather cover.
Under the leather cover, which was worn and stained, it was engraved, on one side, to Richard From Renata With Love.
No one had ever seen this inscription except the girl, the Colonel and the man who had engraved it.
It had not been engraved in the same place it was purchased.
That was in the earliest days, the Colonel thought.
Now who cared?.
On the screw-on top of the flask was engraved From R.
to R.
The Colonel offered the flask to the boatman who looked at him, at the flask, and said, 'What is it?'.
'English grappa.
'I'll try it.
He took a long drink of it; the type of drink peasants take from a flask.
'Thank you.
'Did you have good shooting?'.
'I killed four ducks.
The dog found three cripples shot by other people.
'Why did you shoot?'.
'I'm sorry that I shot.
I shot in anger.
I have done that myself sometimes, the Colonel thought, and did not ask him what the anger was about.
'I am sorry they did not fly better.
'That's the way things go,' the Colonel said.
The Colonel was watching the movement the dog made in the high grass and sedge.
Suddenly he saw him stop; he was quite still.
Then he pounced.
It was a high leap and a dive forward and down.
'He has a crippled,' he said to the boatman.
'Bobby,' the boatman called.
'Bring.
Bring.
The sedge moved and the dog came out with a mallard drake in his jaws.
The grey-white neck and the green head were swaying up and down as a snake's might move.
It was a movement without hope.
The boatman put the boat in sharp for shore.
'I'll take him,' the Colonel said.
'Bobby!'.
He took the duck from the dog's light-holding mouth and felt him intact and sound and beautiful to hold, and with his heart beating and his captured, hopeless eyes.
He looked at him carefully, gentling him as you might gentle a horse.
'He's only wing-tipped,' he said.
'We'll keep him for a caller or to turn loose in the spring.
Here, take him and put him in the sack with the hen.
The boatman took him carefully and put him in the burlap bag that was under the bow.
The Colonel heard the hen speak to him.
Or, maybe she is protesting, he thought.
He could not understand duck-talk through a burlap bag.
'Take a shot of this,' he said to the boatman.
'It's damned cold to-day.
The boatman took the flask and drank deeply again.
'Thank you,' he said.
'Your grappa is very, very good.
Chapter XLIII.
At the landing, before the long low stone house by the side of the canal, there were ducks laid out on the ground In rows.
They were laid in groups that were never of the same number.
There were a few platoons, no companies, and, the Colonel drought, I barely have a squad.
The head game-keeper was standing on the bank in his high boots, his short jacket and his pushed back old felt hat, and he looked critically at the number of ducks on the bow of the boat as they came alongshore.
'It was frozen-up at our post,' the Colonel said.
'I suspected so,' the head keeper said.
'I'm sorry.
It was supposed to be the best post.
'Who was top gun?'.
'The Barone killed forty-two.
There was a little current there that kept it open for a while.
You probably did not hear the shooting because it was against the wind.
'Where is everyone?'.
'They're all gone except the Barone who is waiting for you.
Your driver is asleep in the house.
'He would be,' the Colonel said.
'Spread those out properly,' the head-keeper told the boatman who was a game-keeper too.
'I want to put them to the game book.
'There is one green-head drake in the bag who is only wing-tipped.
'Good.
I will take good care of him.
'I will go inside and see the Barone.
I'll see you later.
'You must get warm,' the head keeper said.
'It's been a bitter day, my Colonel.
The Colonel started to walk towards the door of the house.
'I'll see you later,' he said to the boatman.
'Yes, my Colonel,' the boatman said.
Alvarito, the Barone, was standing by the open fire in the middle of the room.
He smiled his shy smile and said to his low-pitched voice, 'I am sorry you did not have better shooting.
'We froze up completely.
I enjoyed what there was very much.
'Are you very cold?'.
'Not too cold.
'We can have something to eat.
'Thank you.
I'm not hungry.
Have you eaten?'.
'Yes.
The others went on and I let them take my car.
Can you give me a lift to Latisana or just above? I can get transportation from there.
'Of course.
'It was a shame that it should freeze.
The prospects were so good.
'There must have been a world of ducks outside.
'Yes.
But now they won't stay with their feed frozen over.
They will be on their way south to-night.
'Will they all go?'.
'All except our local ducks that breed here.
They'll stay as long as there is any open water.
'I'm sorry for the shoot.
'I'm sorry you came so far for so few ducks.
'I always love the shoot,' the Colonel said.
'And I love Venice.
The Barone Alvarito looked away and spread his hands towards the fire.
'Yes,' he said.
'We all love Venice.
Perhaps you do the best of all.
The Colonel made no small talk on this but said, 'I love Venice as you know.
'Yes.
I know,' the Barone said.
He looked at nothing.
Then he said, 'We must wake your driver.
'Has he eaten?'.
'Eaten and slept and eaten and slept.
He has also read a little in some illustrated books he brought with him.
'Comic books,' the Colonel said.
'I should learn to read them,' the Barone said.
He smiled the shy, dark smile.
'Could you get me some from Trieste?'.
'Any amount,' the Colonel told him.
'From superman on up into the improbable.
Read some for me.
Look, Alvarito, what was the matter with that game-keeper who poled my boat? He seemed to have a hatred for me at the start.
Pretty well through, too.
'It was the old battle-jacket.
Allied uniform affects him that way.
You see he was a bit over-liberated.
'Go on.
'When the Moroccans came through here they raped both his wife and his daughter.
'I think I'd better have a drink,' the Colonel said.
'There is grappa there on the table.
Chapter XLIV.
They had dropped the Barone off at a villa with great gates, a gravelled drive and a house, which, since it was over six miles from any military objective, had the good fortune not to have been bombed.
The Colonel had said good-bye and Alvarito had told him to come down and shoot any, or every, week-end.
'You're sure you won't come in?'.
'No.
I must get back to Trieste.
Will you give my love to Renata?'.
'I will.
Is that her portrait that you have wrapped up in the back of the car?'.
'It is.
'I'll tell her that you shot very well and that the portrait was in good condition.
'Also my love.
'Also your love.
'Ciao, Alvarito, and thank you very much.
'Ciao, my Colonel.
If one can say ciao to a Colonel.
'Consider me not a Colonel.
'It is very difficult.
Good-bye, my Colonel.
'In case of any unforeseen contingencies would you ask her to have the portrait picked up at the Gritti?'.
'Yes, my Colonel.
'That's all, I guess.
'Good-bye, my Colonel.
Chapter XLV.
They were out on the road now and the early darkness was beginning.
'Turn left,' the Colonel said.
'That's not the road for Trieste, sir,' Jackson said.
'The hell with the road to Trieste.
I ordered you to turn left.
Do you think there is only one way in the world to get to Trieste?'.
'No, sir.
I was only pointing out to the Colonel——'.
'Don't you point me out a God-damn thing and until I direct you otherwise, don't speak to me until you are spoken to.
'Yes, sir.
'I'm sorry, Jackson.
What I mean is I know where I'm going and I want to think.
'Yes, sir.
They were on the old road that he knew so well and the Colonel thought, well, I sent four of the ducks I promised to those I promised them to at the Gritti.
There wasn't enough shooting to be enough feathers to do that boy's wife any good with feathers.
But they are all big ducks and fat and they will be good eating.
I forgot to give Bobby the sausage.
There was no time to write Renata a note.
But what could I say, in a note, that we did not say?.
He reached into his pocket and found a pad and pencil.
He put on the map-reading light, and with his bad hand, printed a short message in block letters.
'Put that in your pocket, Jackson, and act on it if necessary.
If the circumstances described occur, it is an order.
'Yes, sir,' Jackson said, and took the folded order blank with one hand and put it in the top left-hand pocket of his tunic.
Now take it easy, the Colonel said to himself.
Any further concern you may have is about yourself and that is just a luxury.
You are no longer of any real use to the Army of the United States.
That has been made quite clear.
You have said good-bye to your girl and she has said good-bye to you.
That is certainly simple.
You shot well and Alvarito understands.
That is that.
So what the hell do you have to worry about, boy? I hope you're not the type of jerk who worries about what happens to him when there's nothing to be done.
Let's certainly hope not.
Just then it hit him as he had known it would since they had picked up the decoys.
Three strikes is out, he thought, and they gave me four.
I've always been a lucky son of a bitch.
It hit him again badly.
'Jackson,' he said.
'Do you know what General Thomas J.
Jackson said on one occasion? On the occasion of his unfortunate death.
I memorized it once.
I can't respond for its accuracy of course.
But this is how it was reported: "Order A.
Hill to prepare for action.
" Then some more delirious stuff.
Then he said, "No, no, let us cross over the river and rest under the shade of the trees.
'That's very interesting, sir,' Jackson said.
'That must have been Stonewall Jackson, sir.
The Colonel started to speak but he stopped while it hit him the third time and gripped bun so he knew he could not live.
'Jackson,' the Colonel said.
'Pull up at the side of the road and cut to your parking lights.
Do you know the way to Trieste from here?'.
'Yes, sir, I have my map.
'Good.
I'm now going to get into the large back seat of this god-damned, over-sized luxurious automobile.
That was the last thing the Colonel ever said.
But he made the back seat all right and he shut the door.
He shut it carefully and well.
After a while Jackson drove the car down the ditch and willow lined road with the car's big lights on, looking for a place to turn.
He found one, finally, and turned carefully.
When he was on the right-hand side of the road, facing south towards the road junction that would put him on the highway that led to Trieste, the one he was familiar with, he put his map light on and took out the order blank and read:.
IN THE EVENT OF MY DEATH THE WRAPPED PAINTING AND THE TWO SHOT GUNS IN THIS CAR WILL BE RETURNED TO THE HOTEL GRITTI WHERE THEY WILL BE CLAIMED BY THEIR RIGHTFUL OWNER SIGNED RICHARD CANTWELL, COL.
, INFANTRY, U.
'They'll return them all right, through channels,' Jackson thought, and put the car in gear.
THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA.
He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish.
In the first forty days a boy had been with him.
But after forty days without a fish the boy's parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week.
It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast.
The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat.
The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck.
The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks.
The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords.
But none of these scars were fresh.
They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.
Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated.
"Santiago," the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was hauled up. "I could go with you again. We've made some money."
The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.
"No," the old man said. "You're with a lucky boat. Stay with them."
"But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big ones every day for three weeks."
"I remember," the old man said. "I know you did not leave me because you doubted."
"It was papa made me leave. I am a boy and I must obey him."
"I know," the old man said. "It is quite normal."
"He hasn't much faith."
"No," the old man said. "But we have. Haven't we?"
"Yes," the boy said. "Can I offer you a beer on the Terrace and then we'll take the stuff home."
"Why not?" the old man said. "Between fishermen."
They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he was not angry.
Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad.
But they did not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen.
The successful fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank, to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in Havana.
Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting.
When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the shark factory; but today there was only the faint edge of the odour because the wind had backed into the north and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace.
"Santiago," the boy said.
"Yes," the old man said. He was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago.
"Can I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow?"
"No. Go and play baseball. I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net."
"I would like to go. If I cannot fish with you, I would like to serve in some way."
"You bought me a beer," the old man said. "You are already a man."
"How old was I when you first took me in a boat?"
"Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green and he nearly tore the boat to pieces. Can you remember?"
"I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the noise of the clubbing. I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like chopping a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me."
"Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?"
"I remember everything from when we first went together."
The old man looked at him with his sun-burned, confident loving eyes.
"If you were my boy I'd take you out and gamble," he said. "But you are your father's and your mother's and you are in a lucky boat."
"May I get the sardines? I know where I can get four baits too."
"I have mine left from today. I put them in salt in the box."
"Let me get four fresh ones."
"One," the old man said. His hope and his confidence had never gone. But now they were freshening as when the breeze rises.
"Two," the boy said.
"Two," the old man agreed. "You didn't steal them?"
"I would," the boy said. "But I bought these."
"Thank you," the old man said. He was too simple to wonder when he had attained humility. But he knew he had attained it and he knew it was not disgraceful and it carried no loss of true pride.
"Tomorrow is going to be a good day with this current," he said.
"Where are you going?" the boy asked.
"Far out to come in when the wind shifts. I want to be out before it is light."
"I'll try to get him to work far out," the boy said. "Then if you hook something truly big we can come to your aid."
"He does not like to work too far out."
"No," the boy said. "But I will see something that he cannot see such as a bird working and get him to come out after dolphin."
"Are his eyes that bad?"
"He is almost blind."
"It is strange," the old man said. "He never went turtle-ing. That is what kills the eyes."
"But you went turtle-ing for years off the Mosquito Coast and your eyes are good."
"I am a strange old man."
"But are you strong enough now for a truly big fish?"
"I think so. And there are many tricks."
"Let us take the stuff home," the boy said. "So I can get the cast net and go after the sardines."
They picked up the gear from the boat.
The old man carried the mast on his shoulder and the boy carried the wooden box with the coiled, hard-braided brown lines, the gaff and the harpoon with its shaft.
The box with the baits was under the stern of the skiff along with the club that was used to subdue the big fish when they were brought alongside.
No one would steal from the old man but it was better to take the sail and the heavy lines home as the dew was bad for them and, though he was quite sure no local people would steal from him, the old man thought that a gaff and a harpoon were needless temptations to leave in a boat.
They walked up the road together to the old man's shack and went in through its open door.
The old man leaned the mast with its wrapped sail against the wall and the boy put the box and the other gear beside it.
The mast was nearly as long as the one room of the shack.
The shack was made of the tough bud-shields of the royal palm which are called guano and in it there was a bed, a table, one chair, and a place on the dirt floor to cook with charcoal.
On the brown walls of the flattened, overlapping leaves of the sturdy fibered guano there was a picture in color of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and another of the Virgin of Cobre.
These were relics of his wife.
Once there had been a tinted photograph of his wife on the wall but he had taken it down because it made him too lonely to see it and it was on the shelf in the corner under his clean shirt.
"What do you have to eat?" the boy asked.
"A pot of yellow rice with fish. Do you want some?"
"No. I will eat at home. Do you want me to make the fire?"
"No. I will make it later on. Or I may eat the rice cold."
"May I take the cast net?"
"Of course."
There was no cast net and the boy remembered when they had sold it.
But they went through this fiction every day.
There was no pot of yellow rice and fish and the boy knew this too.
"Eighty-five is a lucky number," the old man said. "How would you like to see me bring one in that dressed out over a thousand pounds?"
"I'll get the cast net and go for sardines. Will you sit in the sun in the doorway?"
"Yes. I have yesterday's paper and I will read the baseball."
The boy did not know whether yesterday's paper was a fiction too.
But the old man brought it out from under the bed.
"Perico gave it to me at the bodega," he explained.
"I'll be back when I have the sardines. I'll keep yours and mine together on ice and we can share them in the morning. When I come back you can tell me about the baseball."
"The Yankees cannot lose."
"But I fear the Indians of Cleveland."
"Have faith in the Yankees my son. Think of the great DiMaggio."
"I fear both the Tigers of Detroit and the Indians of Cleveland."
"Be careful or you will fear even the Reds of Cincinnati and the White Sox of Chicago."
"You study it and tell me when I come back."
"Do you think we should buy a terminal of the lottery with an eighty-five? Tomorrow is the eighty-fifth day."
"We can do that," the boy said. "But what about the eighty-seven of your great record?"
"It could not happen twice. Do you think you can find an eighty-five?"
"I can order one."
"One sheet. That's two dollars and a half. Who can we borrow that from?"
"That's easy. I can always borrow two dollars and a half."
"I think perhaps I can too. But I try not to borrow. First you borrow. Then you beg."
"Keep warm old man," the boy said. "Remember we are in September."
"The month when the great fish come," the old man said. "Anyone can be a fisherman in May."
"I go now for the sardines," the boy said.
When the boy came back the old man was asleep in the chair and the sun was down.
The boy took the old army blanket off the bed and spread it over the back of the chair and over the old man's shoulders.
They were strange shoulders, still powerful although very old, and the neck was still strong too and the creases did not show so much when the old man was asleep and his head fallen forward.
His shirt had been patched so many times that it was like the sail and the patches were faded to many different shades by the sun.
The old man's head was very old though and with his eyes closed there was no life in his face.
The newspaper lay across his knees and the weight of his arm held it there in the evening breeze.
He was barefooted.
The boy left him there and when he came back the old man was still asleep.
"Wake up old man," the boy said and put his hand on one of the old man's knees.
The old man opened his eyes and for a moment he was coming back from a long way away.
Then he smiled.
"What have you got?" he asked.
"Supper," said the boy. "We're going to have supper."
"I'm not very hungry."
"Come on and eat. You can't fish and not eat."
"I have," the old man said getting up and taking the newspaper and folding it. Then he started to fold the blanket.
"Keep the blanket around you," the boy said. "You'll not fish without eating while I'm alive."
"Then live a long time and take care of yourself," the old man said. "What are we eating?"
"Black beans and rice, fried bananas, and some stew."
The boy had brought them in a two-decker metal container from the Terrace.
The two sets of knives and forks and spoons were in his pocket with a paper napkin wrapped around each set.
"Who gave this to you?"
"Martin. The owner."
"I must thank him."
"I thanked him already," the boy said. "You don't need to thank him."
"I'll give him the belly meat of a big fish," the old man said. "Has he done this for us more than once?"
"I think so."
"I must give him something more than the belly meat then. He is very thoughtful for us."
"He sent two beers."
"I like the beer in cans best."
"I know. But this is in bottles, Hatuey beer, and I take back the bottles."
"That's very kind of you," the old man said. "Should we eat?"
"I've been asking you to," the boy told him gently. "I have not wished to open the container until you were ready."
"I'm ready now," the old man said. "I only needed time to wash."
Where did you wash? the boy thought.
The village water supply was two streets down the road.
I must have water here for him, the boy thought, and soap and a good towel.
Why am I so thoughtless? I must get him another shirt and a jacket for the winter and some sort of shoes and another blanket.
"Your stew is excellent," the old man said.
"Tell me about the baseball," the boy asked him.
"In the American League it is the Yankees as I said," the old man said happily.
"They lost today," the boy told him.
"That means nothing. The great DiMaggio is himself again."
"They have other men on the team."
"Naturally. But he makes the difference. In the other league, between Brooklyn and Philadelphia I must take Brooklyn. But then I think of Dick Sisler and those great drives in the old park."
"There was nothing ever like them. He hits the longest ball I have ever seen."
"Do you remember when he used to come to the Terrace? I wanted to take him fishing but I was too timid to ask him. Then I asked you to ask him and you were too timid."
"I know. It was a great mistake. He might have gone with us. Then we would have that for all of our lives."
"I would like to take the great DiMaggio fishing," the old man said. "They say his father was a fisherman. Maybe he was as poor as we are and would understand."
"The great Sisler's father was never poor and he, the father, was playing in the big leagues when he was my age."
"When I was your age I was before the mast on a square rigged ship that ran to Africa and I have seen lions on the beaches in the evening."
"I know. You told me."
"Should we talk about Africa or about baseball?"
"Baseball I think," the boy said. "Tell me about the great John J. McGraw." He said Jota for J.
"He used to come to the Terrace sometimes too in the older days. But he was rough and harsh-spoken and difficult when he was drinking. His mind was on horses as well as baseball. At least he carried lists of horses at all times in his pocket and frequently spoke the names of horses on the telephone."
"He was a great manager," the boy said. "My father thinks he was the greatest."
"Because he came here the most times," the old man said. "If Durocher had continued to come here each year your father would think him the greatest manager."
"Who is the greatest manager, really, Luque or Mike Gonzalez?"
"I think they are equal."
"And the best fisherman is you."
"No. I know others better."
"Qué va," the boy said. "There are many good fishermen and some great ones. But there is only you."
"Thank you. You make me happy. I hope no fish will come along so great that he will prove us wrong."
"There is no such fish if you are still strong as you say."
"I may not be as strong as I think," the old man said. "But I know many tricks and I have resolution."
"You ought to go to bed now so that you will be fresh in the morning. I will take the things back to the Terrace."
"Good night then. I will wake you in the morning."
"You're my alarm clock," the boy said.
"Age is my alarm clock," the old man said. "Why do old men wake so early? Is it to have one longer day?"
"I don't know," the boy said. "All I know is that young boys sleep late and hard."
"I can remember it," the old man said. "I'll waken you in time."
"I do not like for him to waken me. It is as though I were inferior."
"I know."
"Sleep well, old man."
The boy went out.
They had eaten with no light on the table and the old man took off his trousers and went to bed in the dark.
He rolled his trousers up to make a pillow, putting the newspaper inside them.
He rolled himself in the blanket and slept on the other old newspapers that covered the springs of the bed.
He was asleep in a short time and he dreamed of Africa when he was a boy and the long golden beaches and the white beaches, so white they hurt your eyes, and the high capes and the great brown mountains.
He lived along that coast now every night and in his dreams he heard the surf roar and saw the native boats come riding through it.
He smelled the tar and oakum of the deck as he slept and he smelled the smell of Africa that the land breeze brought at morning.
Usually when he smelled the land breeze he woke up and dressed to go and wake the boy.
But tonight the smell of the land breeze came very early and he knew it was too early in his dream and went on dreaming to see the white peaks of the Islands rising from the sea and then he dreamed of the different harbours and roadsteads of the Canary Islands.
He no longer dreamed of storms, nor of women, nor of great occurrences, nor of great fish, nor fights, nor contests of strength, nor of his wife.
He only dreamed of places now and of the lions on the beach.
They played like young cats in the dusk and he loved them as he loved the boy.
He never dreamed about the boy.
He simply woke, looked out the open door at the moon and unrolled his trousers and put them on.
He urinated outside the shack and then went up the road to wake the boy.
He was shivering with the morning cold.
But he knew he would shiver himself warm and that soon he would be rowing.
The door of the house where the boy lived was unlocked and he opened it and walked in quietly with his bare feet.
The boy was asleep on a cot in the first room and the old man could see him clearly with the light that came in from the dying moon.
He took hold of one foot gently and held it until the boy woke and turned and looked at him.
The old man nodded and the boy took his trousers from the chair by the bed and, sitting on the bed, pulled them on.
The old man went out the door and the boy came after him.
He was sleepy and the old man put his arm across his shoulders and said, "I am sorry.
"Qué va," the boy said. "It is what a man must do."
They walked down the road to the old man's shack and all along the road, in the dark, barefoot men were moving, carrying the masts of their boats.
When they reached the old man's shack the boy took the rolls of line in the basket and the harpoon and gaff and the old man carried the mast with the furled sail on his shoulder.
"Do you want coffee?" the boy asked.
"We'll put the gear in the boat and then get some."
They had coffee from condensed milk cans at an early morning place that served fishermen.
"How did you sleep old man?" the boy asked. He was waking up now although it was still hard for him to leave his sleep.
"Very well, Manolin," the old man said. "I feel confident today."
"So do I," the boy said. "Now I must get your sardines and mine and your fresh baits. He brings our gear himself. He never wants anyone to carry anything."
"We're different," the old man said. "I let you carry things when you were five years old."
"I know it," the boy said. "I'll be right back. Have another coffee. We have credit here."
He walked off, bare-footed on the coral rocks, to the ice house where the baits were stored.
The old man drank his coffee slowly.
It was all he would have all day and he knew that he should take it.
For a long time now eating had bored him and he never carried a lunch.
He had a bottle of water in the bow of the skiff and that was all he needed for the day.
The boy was back now with the sardines and the two baits wrapped in a newspaper and they went down the trail to the skiff, feeling the pebbled sand under their feet, and lifted the skiff and slid her into the water.
"Good luck old man."
"Good luck," the old man said. He fitted the rope lashings of the oars onto the thole pins and, leaning forward against the thrust of the blades in the water, he began to row out of the harbour in the dark. There were other boats from the other beaches going out to sea and the old man heard the dip and push of their oars even though he could not see them now the moon was below the hills.
Sometimes someone would speak in a boat.
But most of the boats were silent except for the dip of the oars.
They spread apart after they were out of the mouth of the harbour and each one headed for the part of the ocean where he hoped to find fish.
The old man knew he was going far out and he left the smell of the land behind and rowed out into the clean early morning smell of the ocean.
He saw the phosphorescence of the Gulf weed in the water as he rowed over the part of the ocean that the fishermen called the great well because there was a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms where all sorts of fish congregated because of the swirl the current made against the steep walls of the floor of the ocean.
Here there were concentrations of shrimp and bait fish and sometimes schools of squid in the deepest holes and these rose close to the surface at night where all the wandering fish fed on them.
In the dark the old man could feel the morning coming and as he rowed he heard the trembling sound as flying fish left the water and the hissing that their stiff set wings made as they soared away in the darkness.
He was very fond of flying fish as they were his principal friends on the ocean.
He was sorry for the birds, especially the small delicate dark terns that were always flying and looking and almost never finding, and he thought, "The birds have a harder life than we do except for the robber birds and the heavy strong ones.
Why did they make birds so delicate and fine as those sea swallows when the ocean can be so cruel? She is kind and very beautiful.
But she can be so cruel and it comes so suddenly and such birds that fly, dipping and hunting, with their small sad voices are made too delicately for the sea.
He always thought of the sea as la mar which is what people call her in Spanish when they love her.
Sometimes those who love her say bad things of her but they are always said as though she were a woman.
Some of the younger fishermen, those who used buoys as floats for their lines and had motorboats, bought when the shark livers had brought much money, spoke of her as el mar which is masculine.
They spoke of her as a contestant or a place or even an enemy.
But the old man always thought of her as feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favours, and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them.
The moon affects her as it does a woman, he thought.
He was rowing steadily and it was no effort for him since he kept well within his speed and the surface of the ocean was flat except for the occasional swirls of the current.
He was letting the current do a third of the work and as it started to be light he saw he was already further out than he had hoped to be at this hour.
I worked the deep wells for a week and did nothing, he thought.
Today I'll work out where the schools of bonita and albacore are and maybe there will be a big one with them.
Before it was really light he had his baits out and was drifting with the current.
One bait was down forty fathoms.
The second was at seventy-five and the third and fourth were down in the blue water at one hundred and one hundred and twenty-five fathoms.
Each bait hung head down with the shank of the hook inside the bait fish, tied and sewed solid and all the projecting part of the hook, the curve and the point, was covered with fresh sardines.
Each sardine was hooked through both eyes so that they made a half-garland on the projecting steel.
There was no part of the hook that a great fish could feel which was not sweet smelling and good tasting.
The boy had given him two fresh small tunas, or albacores, which hung on the two deepest lines like plummets and, on the others, he had a big blue runner and a yellow jack that had been used before; but they were in good condition still and had the excellent sardines to give them scent and attractiveness.
Each line, as thick around as a big pencil, was looped onto a green-sapped stick so that any pull or touch on the bait would make the stick dip and each line had two forty-fathom coils which could be made fast to the other spare coils so that, if it were necessary, a fish could take out over three hundred fathoms of line.
Now the man watched the dip of the three sticks over the side of the skiff and rowed gently to keep the lines straight up and down and at their proper depths.
It was quite light and any moment now the sun would rise.
The sun rose thinly from the sea and the old man could see the other boats, low on the water and well in toward the shore, spread out across the current.
Then the sun was brighter and the glare came on the water and then, as it rose clear, the flat sea sent it back at his eyes so that it hurt sharply and he rowed without looking into it.
He looked down into the water and watched the lines that went straight down into the dark of the water.
He kept them straighter than anyone did, so that at each level in the darkness of the stream there would be a bait waiting exactly where he wished it to be for any fish that swam there.
Others let them drift with the current and sometimes they were at sixty fathoms when the fishermen thought they were at a hundred.
But, he thought, I keep them with precision.
Only I have no luck any more.
But who knows? Maybe today.
Every day is a new day.
It is better to be lucky.
But I would rather be exact.
Then when luck comes you are ready.
The sun was two hours higher now and it did not hurt his eyes so much to look into the east.
There were only three boats in sight now and they showed very low and far inshore.
All my life the early sun has hurt my eyes, he thought.
Yet they are still good.
In the evening I can look straight into it without getting the blackness.
It has more force in the evening too.
But in the morning it is painful.
Just then he saw a man-of-war bird with his long black wings circling in the sky ahead of him.
He made a quick drop, slanting down on his back-swept wings, and then circled again.
"He's got something," the old man said aloud. "He's not just looking."
He rowed slowly and steadily toward where the bird was circling.
He did not hurry and he kept his lines straight up and down.
But he crowded the current a little so that he was still fishing correctly though faster than he would have fished if he was not trying to use the bird.
The bird went higher in the air and circled again, his wings motionless.
Then he dove suddenly and the old man saw flying fish spurt out of the water and sail desperately over the surface.
"Dolphin," the old man said aloud. "Big dolphin."
He shipped his oars and brought a small line from under the bow.
It had a wire leader and a medium-sized hook and he baited it with one of the sardines.
He let it go over the side and then made it fast to a ring bolt in the stern.
Then he baited another line and left it coiled in the shade of the bow.
He went back to rowing and to watching the long-winged black bird who was working, now, low over the water.
As he watched the bird dipped again slanting his wings for the dive and then swinging them wildly and ineffectually as he followed the flying fish.
The old man could see the slight bulge in the water that the big dolphin raised as they followed the escaping fish.
The dolphin were cutting through the water below the flight of the fish and would be in the water, driving at speed, when the fish dropped.
It is a big school of dolphin, he thought.
They are wide spread and the flying fish have little chance.
The bird has no chance.
The flying fish are too big for him and they go too fast.
He watched the flying fish burst out again and again and the ineffectual movements of the bird.
That school has gotten away from me, he thought.
They are moving out too fast and too far.
But perhaps I will pick up a stray and perhaps my big fish is around them.
My big fish must be somewhere.
The clouds over the land now rose like mountains and the coast was only a long green line with the gray blue hills behind it.
The water was a dark blue now, so dark that it was almost purple.
As he looked down into it he saw the red sifting of the plankton in the dark water and the strange light the sun made now.
He watched his lines to see them go straight down out of sight into the water and he was happy to see so much plankton because it meant fish.
The strange light the sun made in the water, now that the sun was higher, meant good weather and so did the shape of the clouds over the land.
But the bird was almost out of sight now and nothing showed on the surface of the water but some patches of yellow, sun-bleached Sargasso weed and the purple, formalized, iridescent, gelatinous bladder of a Portuguese man-of-war floating close beside the boat.
It turned on its side and then righted itself.
It floated cheerfully as a bubble with its long deadly purple filaments trailing a yard behind it in the water.
"Agua mala," the man said. "You whore."
From where he swung lightly against his oars he looked down into the water and saw the tiny fish that were coloured like the trailing filaments and swam between them and under the small shade the bubble made as it drifted.
They were immune to its poison.
But men were not and when some of the filaments would catch on a line and rest there slimy and purple while the old man was working a fish, he would have welts and sores on his arms and hands of the sort that poison ivy or poison oak can give.
But these poisonings from the agua mala came quickly and struck like a whiplash.
The iridescent bubbles were beautiful.
But they were the falsest thing in the sea and the old man loved to see the big sea turtles eating them.
The turtles saw them, approached them from the front, then shut their eyes so they were completely carapaced and ate them filaments and all.
The old man loved to see the turtles eat them and he loved to walk on them on the beach after a storm and hear them pop when he stepped on them with the horny soles of his feet.
He loved green turtles and hawks-bills with their elegance and speed and their great value and he had a friendly contempt for the huge, stupid loggerheads, yellow in their armour-plating, strange in their love-making, and happily eating the Portuguese men-of-war with their eyes shut.
He had no mysticism about turtles although he had gone in turtle boats for many years.
He was sorry for them all, even the great trunk backs that were as long as the skiff and weighed a ton.
Most people are heartless about turtles because a turtle's heart will beat for hours after he has been cut up and butchered.
But the old man thought, I have such a heart too and my feet and hands are like theirs.
He ate the white eggs to give himself strength.
He ate them all through May to be strong in September and October for the truly big fish.
He also drank a cup of shark liver oil each day from the big drum in the shack where many of the fishermen kept their gear.
It was there for all fishermen who wanted it.
Most fishermen hated the taste.
But it was no worse than getting up at the hours that they rose and it was very good against all colds and grippes and it was good for the eyes.
Now the old man looked up and saw that the bird was circling again.
"He's found fish," he said aloud. No flying fish broke the surface and there was no scattering of bait fish. But as the old man watched, a small tuna rose in the air, turned and dropped head first into the water. The tuna shone silver in the sun and after he had dropped back into the water another and another rose and they were jumping in all directions, churning the water and leaping in long jumps after the bait. They were circling it and driving it.
If they don't travel too fast I will get into them, the old man thought, and he watched the school working the water white and the bird now dropping and dipping into the bait fish that were forced to the surface in their panic.
"The bird is a great help," the old man said. Just then the stern line came taut under his foot, where he had kept a loop of the line, and he dropped his oars and felt the weight of the small tuna's shivering pull as he held the line firm and commenced to haul it in. The shivering increased as he pulled in and he could see the blue back of the fish in the water and the gold of his sides before he swung him over the side and into the boat. He lay in the stern in the sun, compact and bullet shaped, his big, unintelligent eyes staring as he thumped his life out against the planking of the boat with the quick shivering strokes of his neat, fast-moving tail. The old man hit him on the head for kindness and kicked him, his body still shuddering, under the shade of the stern.
"Albacore," he said aloud. "He'll make a beautiful bait. He'll weigh ten pounds."
He did not remember when he had first started to talk aloud when he was by himself.
He had sung when he was by himself in the old days and he had sung at night sometimes when he was alone steering on his watch in the smacks or in the turtle boats.
He had probably started to talk aloud, when alone, when the boy had left.
But he did not remember.
When he and the boy fished together they usually spoke only when it was necessary.
They talked at night or when they were storm-bound by bad weather.
It was considered a virtue not to talk unnecessarily at sea and the old man had always considered it so and respected it.
But now he said his thoughts aloud many times since there was no one that they could annoy.
"If the others heard me talking out loud they would think that I am crazy," he said aloud. "But since I am not crazy, I do not care. And the rich have radios to talk to them in their boats and to bring them the baseball."
Now is no time to think of baseball, he thought.
Now is the time to think of only one thing.
That which I was born for.
There might be a big one around that school, he thought.
I picked up only a straggler from the albacore that were feeding.
But they are working far out and fast.
Everything that shows on the surface today travels very fast and to the north-east.
Can that be the time of day? Or is it some sign of weather that I do not know?.
He could not see the green of the shore now but only the tops of the blue hills that showed white as though they were snow-capped and the clouds that looked like high snow mountains above them.
The sea was very dark and the light made prisms in the water.
The myriad flecks of the plankton were annulled now by the high sun and it was only the great deep prisms in the blue water that the old man saw now with his lines going straight down into the water that was a mile deep.
The tuna, the fishermen called all the fish of that species tuna and only distinguished among them by their proper names when they came to sell them or to trade them for baits, were down again.
The sun was hot now and the old man felt it on the back of his neck and felt the sweat trickle down his back as he rowed.
I could just drift, he thought, and sleep and put a bight of line around my toe to wake me.
But today is eighty-five days and I should fish the day well.
Just then, watching his lines, he saw one of the projecting green sticks dip sharply.
"Yes," he said. "Yes," and shipped his oars without bumping the boat. He reached out for the line and held it softly between the thumb and forefinger of his right hand. He felt no strain nor weight and he held the line lightly. Then it came again. This time it was a tentative pull, not solid nor heavy, and he knew exactly what it was. One hundred fathoms down a marlin was eating the sardines that covered the point and the shank of the hook where the hand-forged hook projected from the head of the small tuna.
The old man held the line delicately, and softly, with his left hand, unleashed it from the stick.
Now he could let it run through his fingers without the fish feeling any tension.
This far out, he must be huge in this month, he thought.
Eat them, fish.
Eat them.
Please eat them.
How fresh they are and you down there six hundred feet in that cold water in the dark.
Make another turn in the dark and come back and eat them.
He felt the light delicate pulling and then a harder pull when a sardine's head must have been more difficult to break from the hook.
Then there was nothing.
"Come on," the old man said aloud. "Make another turn. Just smell them. Aren't they lovely? Eat them good now and then there is the tuna. Hard and cold and lovely. Don't be shy, fish. Eat them."
He waited with the line between his thumb and his finger, watching it and the other lines at the same time for the fish might have swum up or down.
Then came the same delicate pulling touch again.
"He'll take it," the old man said aloud. "God help him to take it."
He did not take it though.
He was gone and the old man felt nothing.
"He can't have gone," he said. "Christ knows he can't have gone. He's making a turn. Maybe he has been hooked before and he remembers something of it."
Then he felt the gentle touch on the line and he was happy.
"It was only his turn," he said. "He'll take it."
He was happy feeling the gentle pulling and then he felt something hard and unbelievably heavy.
It was the weight of the fish and he let the line slip down, down, down, unrolling off the first of the two reserve coils.
As it went down, slipping lightly through the old man's fingers, he still could feel the great weight, though the pressure of his thumb and finger were almost imperceptible.
"What a fish," he said. "He has it sideways in his mouth now and he is moving off with it."
Then he will turn and swallow it, he thought.
He did not say that because he knew that if you said a good thing it might not happen.
He knew what a huge fish this was and he thought of him moving away in the darkness with the tuna held crosswise in his mouth.
At that moment he felt him stop moving but the weight was still there.
Then the weight increased and he gave more line.
He tightened the pressure of his thumb and finger for a moment and the weight increased and was going straight down.
"He's taken it," he said. "Now I'll let him eat it well."
He let the line slip through his fingers while he reached down with his left hand and made fast the free end of the two reserve coils to the loop of the two reserve coils of the next line.
Now he was ready.
He had three forty-fathom coils of line in reserve now, as well as the coil he was using.
"Eat it a little more," he said. "Eat it well."
Eat it so that the point of the hook goes into your heart and kills you, he thought.
Come up easy and let me put the harpoon into you.
All right.
Are you ready? Have you been long enough at table?.
"Now!" he said aloud and struck hard with both hands, gained a yard of line and then struck again and again, swinging with each arm alternately on the cord with all the strength of his arms and the pivoted weight of his body.
Nothing happened.
The fish just moved away slowly and the old man could not raise him an inch.
His line was strong and made for heavy fish and he held it against his back until it was so taut that beads of water were jumping from it.
Then it began to make a slow hissing sound in the water and he still held it, bracing himself against the thwart and leaning back against the pull.
The boat began to move slowly off toward the North-West.
The fish moved steadily and they travelled slowly on the calm water.
The other baits were still in the water but there was nothing to be done.
"I wish I had the boy," the old man said aloud. "I'm being towed by a fish and I'm the towing bitt. I could make the line fast. But then he could break it. I must hold him all I can and give him line when he must have it. Thank God he is travelling and not going down."
What I will do if he decides to go down, I don't know.
What I'll do if he sounds and dies I don't know.
But I'll do something.
There are plenty of things I can do.
He held the line against his back and watched its slant in the water and the skiff moving steadily to the North-West.
This will kill him, the old man thought.
He can't do this forever.
But four hours later the fish was still swimming steadily out to sea, towing the skiff, and the old man was still braced solidly with the line across his back.
"It was noon when I hooked him," he said. "And I have never seen him."
He had pushed his straw hat hard down on his head before he hooked the fish and it was cutting his forehead.
He was thirsty too and he got down on his knees and, being careful not to jerk on the line, moved as far into the bow as he could get and reached the water bottle with one hand.
He opened it and drank a little.
Then he rested against the bow.
He rested sitting on the un-stepped mast and sail and tried not to think but only to endure.
Then he looked behind him and saw that no land was visible.
That makes no difference, he thought.
I can always come in on the glow from Havana.
There are two more hours before the sun sets and maybe he will come up before that.
If he doesn't maybe he will come up with the moon.
If he does not do that maybe he will come up with the sunrise.
I have no cramps and I feel strong.
It is he that has the hook in his mouth.
But what a fish to pull like that.
He must have his mouth shut tight on the wire.
I wish I could see him.
I wish I could see him only once to know what I have against me.
The fish never changed his course nor his direction all that night as far as the man could tell from watching the stars.
It was cold after the sun went down and the old man's sweat dried cold on his back and his arms and his old legs.
During the day he had taken the sack that covered the bait box and spread it in the sun to dry.
After the sun went down he tied it around his neck so that it hung down over his back and he cautiously worked it down under the line that was across his shoulders now.
The sack cushioned the line and he had found a way of leaning forward against the bow so that he was almost comfortable.
The position actually was only somewhat less intolerable; but he thought of it as almost comfortable.
I can do nothing with him and he can do nothing with me, he thought.
Not as long as he keeps this up.
Once he stood up and urinated over the side of the skiff and looked at the stars and checked his course.
The line showed like a phosphorescent streak in the water straight out from his shoulders.
They were moving more slowly now and the glow of Havana was not so strong, so that he knew the current must be carrying them to the eastward.
If I lose the glare of Havana we must be going more to the eastward, he thought.
For if the fish's course held true I must see it for many more hours.
I wonder how the baseball came out in the grand leagues today, he thought.
It would be wonderful to do this with a radio.
Then he thought, think of it always.
Think of what you are doing.
You must do nothing stupid.
Then he said aloud, "I wish I had the boy.
To help me and to see this.
No one should be alone in their old age, he thought.
But it is unavoidable.
I must remember to eat the tuna before he spoils in order to keep strong.
Remember, no matter how little you want to, that you must eat him in the morning.
Remember, he said to himself.
During the night two porpoise came around the boat and he could hear them rolling and blowing.
He could tell the difference between the blowing noise the male made and the sighing blow of the female.
"They are good," he said. "They play and make jokes and love one another. They are our brothers like the flying fish."
Then he began to pity the great fish that he had hooked.
He is wonderful and strange and who knows how old he is, he thought.
Never have I had such a strong fish nor one who acted so strangely.
Perhaps he is too wise to jump.
He could ruin me by jumping or by a wild rush.
But perhaps he has been hooked many times before and he knows that this is how he should make his fight.
He cannot know that it is only one man against him, nor that it is an old man.
But what a great fish he is and what he will bring in the market if the flesh is good.
He took the bait like a male and he pulls like a male and his fight has no panic in it.
I wonder if he has any plans or if he is just as desperate as I am?.
He remembered the time he had hooked one of a pair of marlin.
The male fish always let the female fish feed first and the hooked fish, the female, made a wild, panic-stricken, despairing fight that soon exhausted her, and all the time the male had stayed with her, crossing the line and circling with her on the surface.
He had stayed so close that the old man was afraid he would cut the line with his tail which was sharp as a scythe and almost of that size and shape.
When the old man had gaffed her and clubbed her, holding the rapier bill with its sandpaper edge and clubbing her across the top of her head until her colour turned to a colour almost like the backing of mirrors, and then, with the boy's aid, hoisted her aboard, the male fish had stayed by the side of the boat.
Then, while the old man was clearing the lines and preparing the harpoon, the male fish jumped high into the air beside the boat to see where the female was and then went down deep, his lavender wings, that were his pectoral fins, spread wide and all his wide lavender stripes showing.
He was beautiful, the old man remembered, and he had stayed.
That was the saddest thing I ever saw with them, the old man thought.
The boy was sad too and we begged her pardon and butchered her promptly.
"I wish the boy was here," he said aloud and settled himself against the rounded planks of the bow and felt the strength of the great fish through the line he held across his shoulders moving steadily toward whatever he had chosen.
When once, through my treachery, it had been necessary to him to make a choice, the old man thought.
His choice had been to stay in the deep dark water far out beyond all snares and traps and treacheries.
My choice was to go there to find him beyond all people.
Beyond all people in the world.
Now we are joined together and have been since noon.
And no one to help either one of us.
Perhaps I should not have been a fisherman, he thought.
But that was the thing that I was born for.
I must surely remember to eat the tuna after it gets light.
Some time before daylight something took one of the baits that were behind him.
He heard the stick break and the line begin to rush out over the gunwale of the skiff.
In the darkness he loosened his sheath knife and taking all the strain of the fish on his left shoulder he leaned back and cut the line against the wood of the gunwale.
Then he cut the other line closest to him and in the dark made the loose ends of the reserve coils fast.
He worked skillfully with the one hand and put his foot on the coils to hold them as he drew his knots tight.
Now he had six reserve coils of line.
There were two from each bait he had severed and the two from the bait the fish had taken and they were all connected.
After it is light, he thought, I will work back to the forty-fathom bait and cut it away too and link up the reserve coils.
I will have lost two hundred fathoms of good Catalan cordel and the hooks and leaders.
That can be replaced.
But who replaces this fish if I hook some fish and it cuts him off? I don't know what that fish was that took the bait just now.
It could have been a marlin or a broadbill or a shark.
I never felt him.
I had to get rid of him too fast.
Aloud he said, "I wish I had the boy.
But you haven't got the boy, he thought.
You have only yourself and you had better work back to the last line now, in the dark or not in the dark, and cut it away and hook up the two reserve coils.
So he did it.
It was difficult in the dark and once the fish made a surge that pulled him down on his face and made a cut below his eye.
The blood ran down his cheek a little way.
But it coagulated and dried before it reached his chin and he worked his way back to the bow and rested against the wood.
He adjusted the sack and carefully worked the line so that it came across a new part of his shoulders and, holding it anchored with his shoulders, he carefully felt the pull of the fish and then felt with his hand the progress of the skiff through the water.
I wonder what he made that lurch for, he thought.
The wire must have slipped on the great hill of his back.
Certainly his back cannot feel as badly as mine does.
But he cannot pull this skiff forever, no matter how great he is.
Now everything is cleared away that might make trouble and I have a big reserve of line; all that a man can ask.
"Fish," he said softly, aloud, "I'll stay with you until I am dead."
He'll stay with me too, I suppose, the old man thought and he waited for it to be light.
It was cold now in the time before daylight and he pushed against the wood to be warm.
I can do it as long as he can, he thought.
And in the first light the line extended out and down into the water.
The boat moved steadily and when the first edge of the sun rose it was on the old man's right shoulder.
"He's headed north," the old man said. The current will have set us far to the eastward, he thought. I wish he would turn with the current. That would show that he was tiring.
When the sun had risen further the old man realized that the fish was not tiring.
There was only one favorable sign.
The slant of the line showed he was swimming at a lesser depth.
That did not necessarily mean that he would jump.
But he might.
"God let him jump," the old man said. "I have enough line to handle him."
Maybe if I can increase the tension just a little it will hurt him and he will jump, he thought.
Now that it is daylight let him jump so that he'll fill the sacks along his backbone with air and then he cannot go deep to die.
He tried to increase the tension, but the line had been taut up to the very edge of the breaking point since he had hooked the fish and he felt the harshness as he leaned back to pull and knew he could put no more strain on it.
I must not jerk it ever, he thought.
Each jerk widens the cut the hook makes and then when he does jump he might throw it.
Anyway I feel better with the sun and for once I do not have to look into it.
There was yellow weed on the line but the old man knew that only made an added drag and he was pleased.
It was the yellow Gulf weed that had made so much phosphorescence in the night.
"Fish," he said, "I love you and respect you very much. But I will kill you dead before this day ends."
Let us hope so, he thought.
A small bird came toward the skiff from the north.
He was a warbler and flying very low over the water.
The old man could see that he was very tired.
The bird made the stern of the boat and rested there.
Then he flew around the old man's head and rested on the line where he was more comfortable.
"How old are you?" the old man asked the bird. "Is this your first trip?"
The bird looked at him when he spoke.
He was too tired even to examine the line and he teetered on it as his delicate feet gripped it fast.
"It's steady," the old man told him. "It's too steady. You shouldn't be that tired after a windless night. What are birds coming to?"
The hawks, he thought, that come out to sea to meet them.
But he said nothing of this to the bird who could not understand him anyway and who would learn about the hawks soon enough.
"Take a good rest, small bird," he said. "Then go in and take your chance like any man or bird or fish."
It encouraged him to talk because his back had stiffened in the night and it hurt truly now.
"Stay at my house if you like, bird," he said. "I am sorry I cannot hoist the sail and take you in with the small breeze that is rising. But I am with a friend."
Just then the fish gave a sudden lurch that pulled the old man down onto the bow and would have pulled him overboard if he had not braced himself and given some line.
The bird had flown up when the line jerked and the old man had not even seen him go.
He felt the line carefully with his right hand and noticed his hand was bleeding.
"Something hurt him then," he said aloud and pulled back on the line to see if he could turn the fish. But when he was touching the breaking point he held steady and settled back against the strain of the line.
"You're feeling it now, fish," he said. "And so, God knows, am I."
He looked around for the bird now because he would have liked him for company.
The bird was gone.
You did not stay long, the man thought.
But it is rougher where you are going until you make the shore.
How did I let the fish cut me with that one quick pull he made? I must be getting very stupid.
Or perhaps I was looking at the small bird and thinking of him.
Now I will pay attention to my work and then I must eat the tuna so that I will not have a failure of strength.
"I wish the boy were here and that I had some salt," he said aloud.
Shifting the weight of the line to his left shoulder and kneeling carefully he washed his hand in the ocean and held it there, submerged, for more than a minute watching the blood trail away and the steady movement of the water against his hand as the boat moved.
"He has slowed much," he said.
The old man would have liked to keep his hand in the salt water longer but he was afraid of another sudden lurch by the fish and he stood up and braced himself and held his hand up against the sun.
It was only a line burn that had cut his flesh.
But it was in the working part of his hand.
He knew he would need his hands before this was over and he did not like to be cut before it started.
"Now," he said, when his hand had dried, "I must eat the small tuna. I can reach him with the gaff and eat him here in comfort."
He knelt down and found the tuna under the stern with the gaff and drew it toward him keeping it clear of the coiled lines.
Holding the line with his left shoulder again, and bracing on his left hand and arm, he took the tuna off the gaff hook and put the gaff back in place.
He put one knee on the fish and cut strips of dark red meat longitudinally from the back of the head to the tail.
They were wedge-shaped strips and he cut them from next to the back bone down to the edge of the belly.
When he had cut six strips he spread them out on the wood of the bow, wiped his knife on his trousers, and lifted the carcass of the bonito by the tail and dropped it overboard.
"I don't think I can eat an entire one," he said and drew his knife across one of the strips. He could feel the steady hard pull of the line and his left hand was cramped. It drew up tight on the heavy cord and he looked at it in disgust.
"What kind of a hand is that," he said. "Cramp then if you want. Make yourself into a claw. It will do you no good."
Come on, he thought and looked down into the dark water at the slant of the line.
Eat it now and it will strengthen the hand.
It is not the hand's fault and you have been many hours with the fish.
But you can stay with him forever.
Eat the bonito now.
He picked up a piece and put it in his mouth and chewed it slowly.
It was not unpleasant.
Chew it well, he thought, and get all the juices.
It would not be bad to eat with a little lime or with lemon or with salt.
"How do you feel, hand?" he asked the cramped hand that was almost as stiff as rigor mortis. "I'll eat some more for you."
He ate the other part of the piece that he had cut in two.
He chewed it carefully and then spat out the skin.
"How does it go, hand? Or is it too early to know?"
He took another full piece and chewed it.
"It is a strong full-blooded fish," he thought. "I was lucky to get him instead of dolphin. Dolphin is too sweet. This is hardly sweet at all and all the strength is still in it."
There is no sense in being anything but practical though, he thought.
I wish I had some salt.
And I do not know whether the sun will rot or dry what is left, so I had better eat it all although I am not hungry.
The fish is calm and steady.
I will eat it all and then I will be ready.
"Be patient, hand," he said. "I do this for you."
I wish I could feed the fish, he thought.
He is my brother.
But I must kill him and keep strong to do it.
Slowly and conscientiously he ate all of the wedge-shaped strips of fish.
He straightened up, wiping his hand on his trousers.
"Now," he said. "You can let the cord go, hand, and I will handle him with the right arm alone until you stop that nonsense." He put his left foot on the heavy line that the left hand had held and lay back against the pull against his back.
"God help me to have the cramp go," he said. "Because I do not know what the fish is going to do."
But he seems calm, he thought, and following his plan.
But what is his plan, he thought.
And what is mine? Mine I must improvise to his because of his great size.
If he will jump I can kill him.
But he stays down forever.
Then I will stay down with him forever.
He rubbed the cramped hand against his trousers and tried to gentle the fingers.
But it would not open.
Maybe it will open with the sun, he thought.
Maybe it will open when the strong raw tuna is digested.
If I have to have it, I will open it, cost whatever it costs.
But I do not want to open it now by force.
Let it open by itself and come back of its own accord.
After all I abused it much in the night when it was necessary to free and unite the various lines.
He looked across the sea and knew how alone he was now.
But he could see the prisms in the deep dark water and the line stretching ahead and the strange undulation of the calm.
The clouds were building up now for the trade wind and he looked ahead and saw a flight of wild ducks etching themselves against the sky over the water, then blurring, then etching again and he knew no man was ever alone on the sea.
He thought of how some men feared being out of sight of land in a small boat and knew they were right in the months of sudden bad weather.
But now they were in hurricane months and, when there are no hurricanes, the weather of hurricane months is the best of all the year.
If there is a hurricane you always see the signs of it in the sky for days ahead, if you are at sea.
They do not see it ashore because they do not know what to look for, he thought.
The land must make a difference too, in the shape of the clouds.
But we have no hurricane coming now.
He looked at the sky and saw the white cumulus built like friendly piles of ice cream and high above were the thin feathers of the cirrus against the high September sky.
"Light brisa," he said. "Better weather for me than for you, fish."
His left hand was still cramped, but he was unknotting it slowly.
I hate a cramp, he thought.
It is a treachery of one's own body.
It is humiliating before others to have a diarrhoea from ptomaine poisoning or to vomit from it.
But a cramp, he thought of it as a calambre, humiliates oneself especially when one is alone.
If the boy were here he could rub it for me and loosen it down from the forearm, he thought.
But it will loosen up.
Then, with his right hand he felt the difference in the pull of the line before he saw the slant change in the water.
Then, as he leaned against the line and slapped his left hand hard and fast against his thigh he saw the line slanting slowly upward.
"He's coming up," he said. "Come on hand. Please come on."
The line rose slowly and steadily and then the surface of the ocean bulged ahead of the boat and the fish came out.
He came out unendingly and water poured from his sides.
He was bright in the sun and his head and back were dark purple and in the sun the stripes on his sides showed wide and a light lavender.
His sword was as long as a baseball bat and tapered like a rapier and he rose his full length from the water and then re-entered it, smoothly, like a diver and the old man saw the great scythe-blade of his tail go under and the line commenced to race out.
"He is two feet longer than the skiff," the old man said. The line was going out fast but steadily and the fish was not panicked. The old man was trying with both hands to keep the line just inside of breaking strength. He knew that if he could not slow the fish with a steady pressure the fish could take out all the line and break it.
He is a great fish and I must convince him, he thought.
I must never let him learn his strength nor what he could do if he made his run.
If I were him I would put in everything now and go until something broke.
But, thank God, they are not as intelligent as we who kill them; although they are more noble and more able.
The old man had seen many great fish.
He had seen many that weighed more than a thousand pounds and he had caught two of that size in his life, but never alone.
Now alone, and out of sight of land, he was fast to the biggest fish that he had ever seen and bigger than he had ever heard of, and his left hand was still as tight as the gripped claws of an eagle.
It will uncramp though, he thought.
Surely it will uncramp to help my right hand.
There are three things that are brothers: the fish and my two hands.
It must uncramp.
It is unworthy of it to be cramped.
The fish had slowed again and was going at his usual pace.
I wonder why he jumped, the old man thought.
He jumped almost as though to show me how big he was.
I know now, anyway, he thought.
I wish I could show him what sort of man I am.
But then he would see the cramped hand.
Let him think I am more man than I am and I will be so.
I wish I was the fish, he thought, with everything he has against only my will and my intelligence.
He settled comfortably against the wood and took his suffering as it came and the fish swam steadily and the boat moved slowly through the dark water.
There was a small sea rising with the wind coming up from the east and at noon the old man's left hand was uncramped.
"Bad news for you, fish," he said and shifted the line over the sacks that covered his shoulders.
He was comfortable but suffering, although he did not admit the suffering at all.
"I am not religious," he said. "But I will say ten Our Fathers and ten Hail Marys that I should catch this fish, and I promise to make a pilgrimage to the Virgen de Cobre if I catch him. That is a promise."
He commenced to say his prayers mechanically.
Sometimes he would be so tired that he could not remember the prayer and then he would say them fast so that they would come automatically.
Hail Marys are easier to say than Our Fathers, he thought.
"Hail Mary full of Grace the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen." Then he added, "Blessed Virgin, pray for the death of this fish. Wonderful though he is."
With his prayers said, and feeling much better, but suffering exactly as much, and perhaps a little more, he leaned against the wood of the bow and began, mechanically, to work the fingers of his left hand.
The sun was hot now although the breeze was rising gently.
"I had better re-bait that little line out over the stern," he said. "If the fish decides to stay another night I will need to eat again and the water is low in the bottle. I don't think I can get anything but a dolphin here. But if I eat him fresh enough he won't be bad. I wish a flying fish would come on board tonight. But I have no light to attract them. A flying fish is excellent to eat raw and I would not have to cut him up. I must save all my strength now. Christ, I did not know he was so big."
"I'll kill him though," he said. "In all his greatness and his glory."
Although it is unjust, he thought.
But I will show him what a man can do and what a man endures.
"I told the boy I was a strange old man," he said. "Now is when I must prove it."
The thousand times that he had proved it meant nothing.
Now he was proving it again.
Each time was a new time and he never thought about the past when he was doing it.
I wish he'd sleep and I could sleep and dream about the lions, he thought.
Why are the lions the main thing that is left? Don't think, old man, he said to himself.
Rest gently now against the wood and think of nothing.
He is working.
Work as little as you can.
It was getting into the afternoon and the boat still moved slowly and steadily.
But there was an added drag now from the easterly breeze and the old man rode gently with the small sea and the hurt of the cord across his back came to him easily and smoothly.
Once in the afternoon the line started to rise again.
But the fish only continued to swim at a slightly higher level.
The sun was on the old man's left arm and shoulder and on his back.
So he knew the fish had turned east of north.
Now that he had seen him once, he could picture the fish swimming in the water with his purple pectoral fins set wide as wings and the great erect tail slicing through the dark.
I wonder how much he sees at that depth, the old man thought.
His eye is huge and a horse, with much less eye, can see in the dark.
Once I could see quite well in the dark.
Not in the absolute dark.
But almost as a cat sees.
The sun and his steady movement of his fingers had uncramped his left hand now completely and he began to shift more of the strain to it and he shrugged the muscles of his back to shift the hurt of the cord a little.
"If you're not tired, fish," he said aloud, "you must be very strange."
He felt very tired now and he knew the night would come soon and he tried to think of other things.
He thought of the Big Leagues, to him they were the Gran Ligas, and he knew that the Yankees of New York were playing the Tigres of Detroit.
This is the second day now that I do not know the result of the juegos, he thought.
But I must have confidence and I must be worthy of the great DiMaggio who does all things perfectly even with the pain of the bone spur in his heel.
What is a bone spur? he asked himself.
Un espuela de hueso.
We do not have them.
Can it be as painful as the spur of a fighting cock in one's heel? I do not think I could endure that or the loss of the eye and of both eyes and continue to fight as the fighting cocks do.
Man is not much beside the great birds and beasts.
Still I would rather be that beast down there in the darkness of the sea.
"Unless sharks come," he said aloud. "If sharks come, God pity him and me."
Do you believe the great DiMaggio would stay with a fish as long as I will stay with this one? he thought.
I am sure he would and more since he is young and strong.
Also his father was a fisherman.
But would the bone spur hurt him too much?.
"I do not know," he said aloud. "I never had a bone spur."
As the sun set he remembered, to give himself more confidence, the time in the tavern at Casablanca when he had played the hand game with the great negro from Cienfuegos who was the strongest man on the docks.
They had gone one day and one night with their elbows on a chalk line on the table and their forearms straight up and their hands gripped tight.
Each one was trying to force the other's hand down onto the table.
There was much betting and people went in and out of the room under the kerosene lights and he had looked at the arm and hand of the negro and at the negro's face.
They changed the referees every four hours after the first eight so that the referees could sleep.
Blood came out from under the fingernails of both his and the negro's hands and they looked each other in the eye and at their hands and forearms and the bettors went in and out of the room and sat on high chairs against the wall and watched.
The walls were painted bright blue and were of wood and the lamps threw their shadows against them.
The negro's shadow was huge and it moved on the wall as the breeze moved the lamps.
The odds would change back and forth all night and they fed the negro rum and lighted cigarettes for him.
Then the negro, after the rum, would try for a tremendous effort and once he had the old man, who was not an old man then but was Santiago El Campeon, nearly three inches off balance.
But the old man had raised his hand up to dead even again.
He was sure then that he had the negro, who was a fine man and a great athlete, beaten.
And at daylight when the bettors were asking that it be called a draw and the referee was shaking his head, he had unleashed his effort and forced the hand of the negro down and down until it rested on the wood.
The match had started on a Sunday morning and ended on a Monday morning.
Many of the bettors had asked for a draw because they had to go to work on the docks loading sacks of sugar or at the Havana Coal Company.
Otherwise everyone would have wanted it to go to a finish.
But he had finished it anyway and before anyone had to go to work.
For a long time after that everyone had called him The Champion and there had been a return match in the spring.
But not much money was bet and he had won it quite easily since he had broken the confidence of the negro from Cienfuegos in the first match.
After that he had a few matches and then no more.
He decided that he could beat anyone if he wanted to badly enough and he decided that it was bad for his right hand for fishing.
He had tried a few practice matches with his left hand.
But his left hand had always been a traitor and would not do what he called on it to do and he did not trust it.
The sun will bake it out well now, he thought.
It should not cramp on me again unless it gets too cold in the night.
I wonder what this night will bring.
An airplane passed over head on its course to Miami and he watched its shadow scaring up the schools of flying fish.
"With so much flying fish there should be dolphin," he said, and leaned back on the line to see if it was possible to gain any on his fish. But he could not and it stayed at the hardness and water-drop shivering that preceded breaking. The boat moved ahead slowly and he watched the airplane until he could no longer see it.
It must be very strange in an airplane, he thought.
I wonder what the sea looks like from that height? They should be able to see the fish well if they do not fly too high.
I would like to fly very slowly at two hundred fathoms high and see the fish from above.
In the turtle boats I was in the cross-trees of the mast-head and even at that height I saw much.
The dolphin look greener from there and you can see their stripes and their purple spots and you can see all of the school as they swim.
Why is it that all the fast-moving fish of the dark current have purple backs and usually purple stripes or spots? The dolphin looks green of course because he is really golden.
But when he comes to feed, truly hungry, purple stripes show on his sides as on a marlin.
Can it be anger, or the greater speed he makes that brings them out?.
Just before it was dark, as they passed a great island of Sargasso weed that heaved and swung in the light sea as though the ocean were making love with something under a yellow blanket, his small line was taken by a dolphin.
He saw it first when it jumped in the air, true gold in the last of the sun and bending and flapping wildly in the air.
It jumped again and again in the acrobatics of its fear and he worked his way back to the stern and crouching and holding the big line with his right hand and arm, he pulled the dolphin in with his left hand, stepping on the gained line each time with his bare left foot.
When the fish was at the stern, plunging and cutting from side to side in desperation, the old man leaned over the stern and lifted the burnished gold fish with its purple spots over the stern.
Its jaws were working convulsively in quick bites against the hook and it pounded the bottom of the skiff with its long flat body, its tail and its head until he clubbed it across the shining golden head until it shivered and was still.
The old man unhooked the fish, rebaited the line with another sardine and tossed it over.
Then he worked his way slowly back to the bow.
He washed his left hand and wiped it on his trousers.
Then he shifted the heavy line from his right hand to his left and washed his right hand in the sea while he watched the sun go into the ocean and the slant of the big cord.
"He hasn't changed at all," he said. But watching the movement of the water against his hand he noted that it was perceptibly slower.
"I'll lash the two oars together across the stern and that will slow him in the night," he said. "He's good for the night and so am I."
It would be better to gut the dolphin a little later to save the blood in the meat, he thought.
I can do that a little later and lash the oars to make a drag at the same time.
I had better keep the fish quiet now and not disturb him too much at sunset.
The setting of the sun is a difficult time for all fish.
He let his hand dry in the air then grasped the line with it and eased himself as much as he could and allowed himself to be pulled forward against the wood so that the boat took the strain as much, or more, than he did.
I'm learning how to do it, he thought.
This part of it anyway.
Then too, remember he hasn't eaten since he took the bait and he is huge and needs much food.
I have eaten the whole bonito.
Tomorrow I will eat the dolphin.
He called it dorado.
Perhaps I should eat some of it when I clean it.
It will be harder to eat than the bonito.
But, then, nothing is easy.
"How do you feel, fish?" he asked aloud. "I feel good and my left hand is better and I have food for a night and a day. Pull the boat, fish."
He did not truly feel good because the pain from the cord across his back had almost passed pain and gone into a dullness that he mistrusted.
But I have had worse things than that, he thought.
My hand is only cut a little and the cramp is gone from the other.
My legs are all right.
Also now I have gained on him in the question of sustenance.
It was dark now as it becomes dark quickly after the sun sets in September.
He lay against the worn wood of the bow and rested all that he could.
The first stars were out.
He did not know the name of Rigel but he saw it and knew soon they would all be out and he would have all his distant friends.
"The fish is my friend too," he said aloud. "I have never seen or heard of such a fish. But I must kill him. I am glad we do not have to try to kill the stars."
Imagine if each day a man must try to kill the moon, he thought.
The moon runs away.
But imagine if a man each day should have to try to kill the sun? We were born lucky, he thought.
Then he was sorry for the great fish that had nothing to eat and his determination to kill him never relaxed in his sorrow for him.
How many people will he feed, he thought.
But are they worthy to eat him? No, of course not.
There is no one worthy of eating him from the manner of his behaviour and his great dignity.
I do not understand these things, he thought.
But it is good that we do not have to try to kill the sun or the moon or the stars.
It is enough to live on the sea and kill our true brothers.
Now, he thought, I must think about the drag.
It has its perils and its merits.
I may lose so much line that I will lose him, if he makes his effort and the drag made by the oars is in place and the boat loses all her lightness.
Her lightness prolongs both our suffering but it is my safety since he has great speed that he has never yet employed.
No matter what passes I must gut the dolphin so he does not spoil and eat some of him to be strong.
Now I will rest an hour more and feel that he is solid and steady before I move back to the stern to do the work and make the decision.
In the meantime I can see how he acts and if he shows any changes.
The oars are a good trick; but it has reached the time to play for safety.
He is much fish still and I saw that the hook was in the corner of his mouth and he has kept his mouth tight shut.
The punishment of the hook is nothing.
The punishment of hunger, and that he is against something that he does not comprehend, is everything.
Rest now, old man, and let him work until your next duty comes.
He rested for what he believed to be two hours.
The moon did not rise now until late and he had no way of judging the time.
Nor was he really resting except comparatively.
He was still bearing the pull of the fish across his shoulders but he placed his left hand on the gunwale of the bow and confided more and more of the resistance to the fish to the skiff itself.
How simple it would be if I could make the line fast, he thought.
But with one small lurch he could break it.
I must cushion the pull of the line with my body and at all times be ready to give line with both hands.
"But you have not slept yet, old man," he said aloud. "It is half a day and a night and now another day and you have not slept. You must devise a way so that you sleep a little if he is quiet and steady. If you do not sleep you might become unclear in the head."
I'm clear enough in the head, he thought.
Too clear.
I am as clear as the stars that are my brothers.
Still I must sleep.
They sleep and the moon and the sun sleep and even the ocean sleeps sometimes on certain days when there is no current and a flat calm.
But remember to sleep, he thought.
Make yourself do it and devise some simple and sure way about the lines.
Now go back and prepare the dolphin.
It is too dangerous to rig the oars as a drag if you must sleep.
I could go without sleeping, he told himself.
But it would be too dangerous.
He started to work his way back to the stern on his hands and knees, being careful not to jerk against the fish.
He may be half asleep himself, he thought.
But I do not want him to rest.
He must pull until he dies.
Back in the stern he turned so that his left hand held the strain of the line across his shoulders and drew his knife from its sheath with his right hand.
The stars were bright now and he saw the dolphin clearly and he pushed the blade of his knife into his head and drew him out from under the stern.
He put one of his feet on the fish and slit him quickly from the vent up to the tip of his lower jaw.
Then he put his knife down and gutted him with his right hand, scooping him clean and pulling the gills clear.
He felt the maw heavy and slippery in his hands and he slit it open.
There were two flying fish inside.
They were fresh and hard and he laid them side by side and dropped the guts and the gills over the stern.
They sank leaving a trail of phosphorescence in the water.
The dolphin was cold and a leprous gray-white now in the starlight and the old man skinned one side of him while he held his right foot on the fish's head.
Then he turned him over and skinned the other side and cut each side off from the head down to the tail.
He slid the carcass overboard and looked to see if there was any swirl in the water.
But there was only the light of its slow descent.
He turned then and placed the two flying fish inside the two fillets of fish and putting his knife back in its sheath, he worked his way slowly back to the bow.
His back was bent with the weight of the line across it and he carried the fish in his right hand.
Back in the bow he laid the two fillets of fish out on the wood with the flying fish beside them.
After that he settled the line across his shoulders in a new place and held it again with his left hand resting on the gunwale.
Then he leaned over the side and washed the flying fish in the water, noting the speed of the water against his hand.
His hand was phosphorescent from skinning the fish and he watched the flow of the water against it.
The flow was less strong and as he rubbed the side of his hand against the planking of the skiff, particles of phosphorus floated off and drifted slowly astern.
"He is tiring or he is resting," the old man said. "Now let me get through the eating of this dolphin and get some rest and a little sleep."
Under the stars and with the night colder all the time he ate half of one of the dolphin fillets and one of the flying fish, gutted and with its head cut off.
"What an excellent fish dolphin is to eat cooked," he said. "And what a miserable fish raw. I will never go in a boat again without salt or limes."
If I had brains I would have splashed water on the bow all day and drying, it would have made salt, he thought.
But then I did not hook the dolphin until almost sunset.
Still it was a lack of preparation.
But I have chewed it all well and I am not nauseated.
The sky was clouding over to the east and one after another the stars he knew were gone.
It looked now as though he were moving into a great canyon of clouds and the wind had dropped.
"There will be bad weather in three or four days," he said. "But not tonight and not tomorrow. Rig now to get some sleep, old man, while the fish is calm and steady."
He held the line tight in his right hand and then pushed his thigh against his right hand as he leaned all his weight against the wood of the bow.
Then he passed the line a little lower on his shoulders and braced his left hand on it.
My right hand can hold it as long as it is braced, he thought.
If it relaxes in sleep my left hand will wake me as the line goes out.
It is hard on the right hand.
But he is used to punishment.
Even if I sleep twenty minutes or a half an hour it is good.
He lay forward cramping himself against the line with all of his body, putting all his weight onto his right hand, and he was asleep.
He did not dream of the lions but instead of a vast school of porpoises that stretched for eight or ten miles and it was in the time of their mating and they would leap high into the air and return into the same hole they had made in the water when they leaped.
Then he dreamed that he was in the village on his bed and there was a norther and he was very cold and his right arm was asleep because his head had rested on it instead of a pillow.
After that he began to dream of the long yellow beach and he saw the first of the lions come down onto it in the early dark and then the other lions came and he rested his chin on the wood of the bows where the ship lay anchored with the evening off-shore breeze and he waited to see if there would be more lions and he was happy.
The moon had been up for a long time but he slept on and the fish pulled on steadily and the boat moved into the tunnel of clouds.
He woke with the jerk of his right fist coming up against his face and the line burning out through his right hand.
He had no feeling of his left hand but he braked all he could with his right and the line rushed out.
Finally his left hand found the line and he leaned back against the line and now it burned his back and his left hand, and his left hand was taking all the strain and cutting badly.
He looked back at the coils of line and they were feeding smoothly.
Just then the fish jumped making a great bursting of the ocean and then a heavy fall.
Then he jumped again and again and the boat was going fast although line was still racing out and the old man was raising the strain to breaking point and raising it to breaking point again and again.
He had been pulled down tight onto the bow and his face was in the cut slice of dolphin and he could not move.
This is what we waited for, he thought.
So now let us take it.
Make him pay for the line, he thought.
Make him pay for it.
He could not see the fish's jumps but only heard the breaking of the ocean and the heavy splash as he fell.
The speed of the line was cutting his hands badly but he had always known this would happen and he tried to keep the cutting across the calloused parts and not let the line slip into the palm nor cut the fingers.
If the boy was here he would wet the coils of line, he thought.
Yes.
If the boy were here.
If the boy were here.
The line went out and out and out but it was slowing now and he was making the fish earn each inch of it.
Now he got his head up from the wood and out of the slice of fish that his cheek had crushed.
Then he was on his knees and then he rose slowly to his feet.
He was ceding line but more slowly all the time.
He worked back to where he could feel with his foot the coils of line that he could not see.
There was plenty of line still and now the fish had to pull the friction of all that new line through the water.
Yes, he thought.
And now he has jumped more than a dozen times and filled the sacks along his back with air and he cannot go down deep to die where I cannot bring him up.
He will start circling soon and then I must work on him.
I wonder what started him so suddenly? Could it have been hunger that made him desperate, or was he frightened by something in the night? Maybe he suddenly felt fear.
But he was such a calm, strong fish and he seemed so fearless and so confident.
It is strange.
"You better be fearless and confident yourself, old man," he said. "You're holding him again but you cannot get line. But soon he has to circle."
The old man held him with his left hand and his shoulders now and stooped down and scooped up water in his right hand to get the crushed dolphin flesh off of his face.
He was afraid that it might nauseate him and he would vomit and lose his strength.
When his face was cleaned he washed his right hand in the water over the side and then let it stay in the salt water while he watched the first light come before the sunrise.
He's headed almost east, he thought.
That means he is tired and going with the current.
Soon he will have to circle.
Then our true work begins.
After he judged that his right hand had been in the water long enough he took it out and looked at it.
"It is not bad," he said.
"And pain does not matter to a man.
He took hold of the line carefully so that it did not fit into any of the fresh line cuts and shifted his weight so that he could put his left hand into the sea on the other side of the skiff.
"You did not do so badly for something worthless," he said to his left hand. "But there was a moment when I could not find you."
Why was I not born with two good hands? he thought.
Perhaps it was my fault in not training that one properly.
But God knows he has had enough chances to learn.
He did not do so badly in the night, though, and he has only cramped once.
If he cramps again let the line cut him off.
When he thought that he knew that he was not being clear-headed and he thought he should chew some more of the dolphin.
But I can't, he told himself.
It is better to be light-headed than to lose your strength from nausea.
And I know I cannot keep it if I eat it since my face was in it.
I will keep it for an emergency until it goes bad.
But it is too late to try for strength now through nourishment.
You're stupid, he told himself.
Eat the other flying fish.
It was there, cleaned and ready, and he picked it up with his left hand and ate it chewing the bones carefully and eating all of it down to the tail.
It has more nourishment than almost any fish, he thought.
At least the kind of strength that I need.
Now I have done what I can, he thought.
Let him begin to circle and let the fight come.
The sun was rising for the third time since he had put to sea when the fish started to circle.
He could not see by the slant of the line that the fish was circling.
It was too early for that.
He just felt a faint slackening of the pressure of the line and he commenced to pull on it gently with his right hand.
It tightened, as always, but just when he reached the point where it would break, line began to come in.
He slipped his shoulders and head from under the line and began to pull in line steadily and gently.
He used both of his hands in a swinging motion and tried to do the pulling as much as he could with his body and his legs.
His old legs and shoulders pivoted with the swinging of the pulling.
"It is a very big circle," he said. "But he is circling."
Then the line would not come in any more and he held it until he saw the drops jumping from it in the sun.
Then it started out and the old man knelt down and let it go grudgingly back into the dark water.
"He is making the far part of his circle now," he said. I must hold all I can, he thought. The strain will shorten his circle each time. Perhaps in an hour I will see him. Now I must convince him and then I must kill him.
But the fish kept on circling slowly and the old man was wet with sweat and tired deep into his bones two hours later.
But the circles were much shorter now and from the way the line slanted he could tell the fish had risen steadily while he swam.
For an hour the old man had been seeing black spots before his eyes and the sweat salted his eyes and salted the cut over his eye and on his forehead.
He was not afraid of the black spots.
They were normal at the tension that he was pulling on the line.
Twice, though, he had felt faint and dizzy and that had worried him.
"I could not fail myself and die on a fish like this," he said. "Now that I have him coming so beautifully, God help me endure. I'll say a hundred Our Fathers and a hundred Hail Marys. But I cannot say them now."
Consider them said, he thought.
I'll say them later.
Just then he felt a sudden banging and jerking on the line he held with his two hands.
It was sharp and hard-feeling and heavy.
He is hitting the wire leader with his spear, he thought.
That was bound to come.
He had to do that.
It may make him jump though and I would rather he stayed circling now.
The jumps were necessary for him to take air.
But after that each one can widen the opening of the hook wound and he can throw the hook.
"Don't jump, fish," he said. "Don't jump."
The fish hit the wire several times more and each time he shook his head the old man gave up a little line.
I must hold his pain where it is, he thought.
Mine does not matter.
I can control mine.
But his pain could drive him mad.
After a while the fish stopped beating at the wire and started circling slowly again.
The old man was gaining line steadily now.
But he felt faint again.
He lifted some sea water with his left hand and put it on his head.
Then he put more on and rubbed the back of his neck.
"I have no cramps," he said. "He'll be up soon and I can last. You have to last. Don't even speak of it."
He kneeled against the bow and, for a moment, slipped the line over his back again.
I'll rest now while he goes out on the circle and then stand up and work on him when he comes in, he decided.
It was a great temptation to rest in the bow and let the fish make one circle by himself without recovering any line.
But when the strain showed the fish had turned to come toward the boat, the old man rose to his feet and started the pivoting and the weaving pulling that brought in all the line he gained.
I'm tireder than I have ever been, he thought, and now the trade wind is rising.
But that will be good to take him in with.
I need that badly.
"I'll rest on the next turn as he goes out," he said. "I feel much better. Then in two or three turns more I will have him."
His straw hat was far on the back of his head and he sank down into the bow with the pull of the line as he felt the fish turn.
You work now, fish, he thought.
I'll take you at the turn.
The sea had risen considerably.
But it was a fair-weather breeze and he had to have it to get home.
"I'll just steer south and west," he said. "A man is never lost at sea and it is a long island."
It was on the third turn that he saw the fish first.
He saw him first as a dark shadow that took so long to pass under the boat that he could not believe its length.
"No," he said. "He can't be that big."
But he was that big and at the end of this circle he came to the surface only thirty yards away and the man saw his tail out of water.
It was higher than a big scythe blade and a very pale lavender above the dark blue water.
It raked back and as the fish swam just below the surface the old man could see his huge bulk and the purple stripes that banded him.
His dorsal fin was down and his huge pectorals were spread wide.
On this circle the old man could see the fish's eye and the two gray sucking fish that swam around him.
Sometimes they attached themselves to him.
Sometimes they darted off.
Sometimes they would swim easily in his shadow.
They were each over three feet long and when they swam fast they lashed their whole bodies like eels.
The old man was sweating now but from something else besides the sun.
On each calm placid turn the fish made he was gaining line and he was sure that in two turns more he would have a chance to get the harpoon in.
But I must get him close, close, close, he thought.
I mustn't try for the head.
I must get the heart.
"Be calm and strong, old man," he said.
On the next circle the fish's back was out but he was a little too far from the boat.
On the next circle he was still too far away but he was higher out of water and the old man was sure that by gaining some more line he could have him alongside.
He had rigged his harpoon long before and its coil of light rope was in a round basket and the end was made fast to the bitt in the bow.
The fish was coming in on his circle now calm and beautiful looking and only his great tail moving.
The old man pulled on him all that he could to bring him closer.
For just a moment the fish turned a little on his side.
Then he straightened himself and began another circle.
"I moved him," the old man said. "I moved him then."
He felt faint again now but he held on the great fish all the strain that he could.
I moved him, he thought.
Maybe this time I can get him over.
Pull, hands, he thought.
Hold up, legs.
Last for me, head.
Last for me.
You never went.
This time I'll pull him over.
But when he put all of his effort on, starting it well out before the fish came alongside and pulling with all his strength, the fish pulled part way over and then righted himself and swam away.
"Fish," the old man said. "Fish, you are going to have to die anyway. Do you have to kill me too?"
That way nothing is accomplished, he thought.
His mouth was too dry to speak but he could not reach for the water now.
I must get him alongside this time, he thought.
I am not good for many more turns.
Yes you are, he told himself.
You're good for ever.
On the next turn, he nearly had him.
But again the fish righted himself and swam slowly away.
You are killing me, fish, the old man thought.
But you have a right to.
Never have I seen a greater, or more beautiful, or a calmer or more noble thing than you, brother.
Come on and kill me.
I do not care who kills who.
Now you are getting confused in the head, he thought.
You must keep your head clear.
Keep your head clear and know how to suffer like a man.
Or a fish, he thought.
"Clear up, head," he said in a voice he could hardly hear. "Clear up."
Twice more it was the same on the turns.
I do not know, the old man thought.
He had been on the point of feeling himself go each time.
I do not know.
But I will try it once more.
He tried it once more and he felt himself going when he turned the fish.
The fish righted himself and swam off again slowly with the great tail weaving in the air.
I'll try it again, the old man promised, although his hands were mushy now and he could only see well in flashes.
He tried it again and it was the same.
So, he thought, and he felt himself going before he started; I will try it once again.
He took all his pain and what was left of his strength and his long gone pride and he put it against the fish's agony and the fish came over onto his side and swam gently on his side, his bill almost touching the planking of the skiff and started to pass the boat, long, deep, wide, silver and barred with purple and interminable in the water.
The old man dropped the line and put his foot on it and lifted the harpoon as high as he could and drove it down with all his strength, and more strength he had just summoned, into the fish's side just behind the great chest fin that rose high in the air to the altitude of the man's chest.
He felt the iron go in and he leaned on it and drove it further and then pushed all his weight after it.
Then the fish came alive, with his death in him, and rose high out of the water showing all his great length and width and all his power and his beauty.
He seemed to hang in the air above the old man in the skiff.
Then he fell into the water with a crash that sent spray over the old man and over all of the skiff.
The old man felt faint and sick and he could not see well.
But he cleared the harpoon line and let it run slowly through his raw hands and, when he could see, he saw the fish was on his back with his silver belly up.
The shaft of the harpoon was projecting at an angle from the fish's shoulder and the sea was discolouring with the red of the blood from his heart.
First it was dark as a shoal in the blue water that was more than a mile deep.
Then it spread like a cloud.
The fish was silvery and still and floated with the waves.
The old man looked carefully in the glimpse of vision that he had.
Then he took two turns of the harpoon line around the bitt in the bow and laid his head on his hands.
"Keep my head clear," he said against the wood of the bow. "I am a tired old man. But I have killed this fish which is my brother and now I must do the slave work."
Now I must prepare the nooses and the rope to lash him alongside, he thought.
Even if we were two and swamped her to load him and bailed her out, this skiff would never hold him.
I must prepare everything, then bring him in and lash him well and step the mast and set sail for home.
He started to pull the fish in to have him alongside so that he could pass a line through his gills and out his mouth and make his head fast alongside the bow.
I want to see him, he thought, and to touch and to feel him.
He is my fortune, he thought.
But that is not why I wish to feel him.
I think I felt his heart, he thought.
When I pushed on the harpoon shaft the second time.
Bring him in now and make him fast and get the noose around his tail and another around his middle to bind him to the skiff.
"Get to work, old man," he said. He took a very small drink of the water. "There is very much slave work to be done now that the fight is over."
He looked up at the sky and then out to his fish.
He looked at the sun carefully.
It is not much more than noon, he thought.
And the trade wind is rising.
The lines all mean nothing now.
The boy and I will splice them when we are home.
"Come on, fish," he said. But the fish did not come. Instead he lay there wallowing now in the seas and the old man pulled the skiff up onto him.
When he was even with him and had the fish's head against the bow he could not believe his size.
But he untied the harpoon rope from the bitt, passed it through the fish's gills and out his jaws, made a turn around his sword then passed the rope through the other gill, made another turn around the bill and knotted the double rope and made it fast to the bitt in the bow.
He cut the rope then and went astern to noose the tail.
The fish had turned silver from his original purple and silver, and the stripes showed the same pale violet colour as his tail.
They were wider than a man's hand with his fingers spread and the fish's eye looked as detached as the mirrors in a periscope or as a saint in a procession.
"It was the only way to kill him," the old man said. He was feeling better since the water and he knew he would not go away and his head was clear. He's over fifteen hundred pounds the way he is, he thought. Maybe much more. If he dresses out two-thirds of that at thirty cents a pound?
"I need a pencil for that," he said. "My head is not that clear. But I think the great DiMaggio would be proud of me today. I had no bone spurs. But the hands and the back hurt truly." I wonder what a bone spur is, he thought. Maybe we have them without knowing of it.
He made the fish fast to bow and stern and to the middle thwart.
He was so big it was like lashing a much bigger skiff alongside.
He cut a piece of line and tied the fish's lower jaw against his bill so his mouth would not open and they would sail as cleanly as possible.
Then he stepped the mast and, with the stick that was his gaff and with his boom rigged, the patched sail drew, the boat began to move, and half lying in the stern he sailed south-west.
He did not need a compass to tell him where south-west was.
He only needed the feel of the trade wind and the drawing of the sail.
I better put a small line out with a spoon on it and try and get something to eat and drink for the moisture.
But he could not find a spoon and his sardines were rotten.
So he hooked a patch of yellow gulf weed with the gaff as they passed and shook it so that the small shrimps that were in it fell onto the planking of the skiff.
There were more than a dozen of them and they jumped and kicked like sand fleas.
The old man pinched their heads off with his thumb and forefinger and ate them chewing up the shells and the tails.
They were very tiny but he knew they were nourishing and they tasted good.
The old man still had two drinks of water in the bottle and he used half of one after he had eaten the shrimps.
The skiff was sailing well considering the handicaps and he steered with the tiller under his arm.
He could see the fish and he had only to look at his hands and feel his back against the stern to know that this had truly happened and was not a dream.
At one time when he was feeling so badly toward the end, he had thought perhaps it was a dream.
Then when he had seen the fish come out of the water and hang motionless in the sky before he fell, he was sure there was some great strangeness and he could not believe it.
Then he could not see well, although now he saw as well as ever.
Now he knew there was the fish and his hands and back were no dream.
The hands cure quickly, he thought.
I bled them clean and the salt water will heal them.
The dark water of the true gulf is the greatest healer that there is.
All I must do is keep the head clear.
The hands have done their work and we sail well.
With his mouth shut and his tail straight up and down we sail like brothers.
Then his head started to become a little unclear and he thought, is he bringing me in or am I bringing him in? If I were towing him behind there would be no question.
Nor if the fish were in the skiff, with all dignity gone, there would be no question either.
But they were sailing together lashed side by side and the old man thought, let him bring me in if it pleases him.
I am only better than him through trickery and he meant me no harm.
They sailed well and the old man soaked his hands in the salt water and tried to keep his head clear.
There were high cumulus clouds and enough cirrus above them so that the old man knew the breeze would last all night.
The old man looked at the fish constantly to make sure it was true.
It was an hour before the first shark hit him.
The shark was not an accident.
He had come up from deep down in the water as the dark cloud of blood had settled and dispersed in the mile deep sea.
He had come up so fast and absolutely without caution that he broke the surface of the blue water and was in the sun.
Then he fell back into the sea and picked up the scent and started swimming on the course the skiff and the fish had taken.
Sometimes he lost the scent.
But he would pick it up again, or have just a trace of it, and he swam fast and hard on the course.
He was a very big Mako shark built to swim as fast as the fastest fish in the sea and everything about him was beautiful except his jaws.
His back was as blue as a sword fish's and his belly was silver and his hide was smooth and handsome.
He was built as a sword fish except for his huge jaws which were tight shut now as he swam fast, just under the surface with his high dorsal fin knifing through the water without wavering.
Inside the closed double lip of his jaws all of his eight rows of teeth were slanted inwards.
They were not the ordinary pyramid-shaped teeth of most sharks.
They were shaped like a man's fingers when they are crisped like claws.
They were nearly as long as the fingers of the old man and they had razor-sharp cutting edges on both sides.
This was a fish built to feed on all the fishes in the sea, that were so fast and strong and well armed that they had no other enemy.
Now he speeded up as he smelled the fresher scent and his blue dorsal fin cut the water.
When the old man saw him coming he knew that this was a shark that had no fear at all and would do exactly what he wished.
He prepared the harpoon and made the rope fast while he watched the shark come on.
The rope was short as it lacked what he had cut away to lash the fish.
The old man's head was clear and good now and he was full of resolution but he had little hope.
It was too good to last, he thought.
He took one look at the great fish as he watched the shark close in.
It might as well have been a dream, he thought.
I cannot keep him from hitting me but maybe I can get him.
Dentuso, he thought.
Bad luck to your mother.
The shark closed fast astern and when he hit the fish the old man saw his mouth open and his strange eyes and the clicking chop of the teeth as he drove forward in the meat just above the tail.
The shark's head was out of water and his back was coming out and the old man could hear the noise of skin and flesh ripping on the big fish when he rammed the harpoon down onto the shark's head at a spot where the line between his eyes intersected with the line that ran straight back from his nose.
There were no such lines.
There was only the heavy sharp blue head and the big eyes and the clicking, thrusting all-swallowing jaws.
But that was the location of the brain and the old man hit it.
He hit it with his blood mushed hands driving a good harpoon with all his strength.
He hit it without hope but with resolution and complete malignancy.
The shark swung over and the old man saw his eye was not alive and then he swung over once again, wrapping himself in two loops of the rope.
The old man knew that he was dead but the shark would not accept it.
Then, on his back, with his tail lashing and his jaws clicking, the shark plowed over the water as a speed-boat does.
The water was white where his tail beat it and three-quarters of his body was clear above the water when the rope came taut, shivered, and then snapped.
The shark lay quietly for a little while on the surface and the old man watched him.
Then he went down very slowly.
"He took about forty pounds," the old man said aloud. He took my harpoon too and all the rope, he thought, and now my fish bleeds again and there will be others.
He did not like to look at the fish anymore since he had been mutilated.
When the fish had been hit it was as though he himself were hit.
But I killed the shark that hit my fish, he thought.
And he was the biggest dentuso that I have ever seen.
And God knows that I have seen big ones.
It was too good to last, he thought.
I wish it had been a dream now and that I had never hooked the fish and was alone in bed on the newspapers.
"But man is not made for defeat," he said. "A man can be destroyed but not defeated." I am sorry that I killed the fish though, he thought. Now the bad time is coming and I do not even have the harpoon. The dentuso is cruel and able and strong and intelligent. But I was more intelligent that he was. Perhaps not, he thought. Perhaps I was only better armed.
"Don't think, old man," he said aloud. "Sail on this course and take it when it comes."
But I must think, he thought.
Because it is all I have left.
That and baseball.
I wonder how the great DiMaggio would have liked the way I hit him in the brain? It was no great thing, he thought.
Any man could do it.
But do you think my hands were as great a handicap as the bone spurs? I cannot know.
I never had anything wrong with my heel except the time the sting ray stung it when I stepped on him when swimming and paralyzed the lower leg and made the unbearable pain.
"Think about something cheerful, old man," he said. "Every minute now you are closer to home. You sail lighter for the loss of forty pounds."
He knew quite well the pattern of what could happen when he reached the inner part of the current.
But there was nothing to be done now.
"Yes there is," he said aloud. "I can lash my knife to the butt of one of the oars."
So he did that with the tiller under his arm and the sheet of the sail under his foot.
"Now," he said. "I am still an old man. But I am not unarmed."
The breeze was fresh now and he sailed on well.
He watched only the forward part of the fish and some of his hope returned.
It is silly not to hope, he thought.
Besides I believe it is a sin.
Do not think about sin, he thought.
There are enough problems now without sin.
Also I have no understanding of it.
I have no understanding of it and I am not sure that I believe in it.
Perhaps it was a sin to kill the fish.
I suppose it was even though I did it to keep me alive and feed many people.
But then everything is a sin.
Do not think about sin.
It is much too late for that and there are people who are paid to do it.
Let them think about it.
You were born to be a fisherman as the fish was born to be a fish.
San Pedro was a fisherman as was the father of the great DiMaggio.
But he liked to think about all things that he was involved in and since there was nothing to read and he did not have a radio, he thought much and he kept on thinking about sin.
You did not kill the fish only to keep alive and to sell for food, he thought.
You killed him for pride and because you are a fisherman.
You loved him when he was alive and you loved him after.
It you love him, it is not a sin to kill him.
Or is it more?.
"You think too much, old man," he said aloud.
But you enjoyed killing the dentuso, he thought.
He lives on the live fish as you do.
He is not a scavenger nor just a moving appetite as some sharks are.
He is beautiful and noble and knows no fear of anything.
"I killed him in self-defense," the old man said aloud. "And I killed him well."
Besides, he thought, everything kills everything else in some way.
Fishing kills me exactly as it keeps me alive.
The boy keeps me alive, he thought.
I must not deceive myself too much.
He leaned over the side and pulled loose a piece of the meat of the fish where the shark had cut him.
He chewed it and noted its quality and its good taste.
It was firm and juicy, like meat, but it was not red.
There was no stringiness in it and he knew that it would bring the highest price in the market.
But there was no way to keep its scent out of the water and the old man knew that a very bad time was coming.
The breeze was steady.
It had backed a little further into the north-east and he knew that meant that it would not fall off.
The old man looked ahead of him but he could see no sails nor could he see the hull nor the smoke of any ship.
There were only the flying fish that went up from his bow sailing away to either side and the yellow patches of gulf-weed.
He could not even see a bird.
He had sailed for two hours, resting in the stern and sometimes chewing a bit of the meat from the marlin, trying to rest and to be strong, when he saw the first of the two sharks.
"Ay," he said aloud. There is no translation for this word and perhaps it is just a noise such as a man might make, involuntarily, feeling the nail go through his hands and into the wood.
"Galanos," he said aloud. He had seen the second fin now coming up behind the first and had identified them as shovel-nosed sharks by the brown, triangular fin and the sweeping movements of the tail. They had the scent and were excited and in the stupidity of their great hunger they were losing and finding the scent in their excitement. But they were closing all the time.
The old man made the sheet fast and jammed the tiller.
Then he took up the oar with the knife lashed to it.
He lifted it as lightly as he could because his hands rebelled at the pain.
Then he opened and closed them on it lightly to loosen them.
He closed them firmly so they would take the pain now and would not flinch and watched the sharks come.
He could see their wide, flattened, shovel-pointed heads now and their white-tipped wide pectoral fins.
They were hateful sharks, bad smelling, scavengers as well as killers, and when they were hungry they would bite at an oar or the rudder of a boat.
It was these sharks that would cut the turtles' legs and flippers off when the turtles were asleep on the surface, and they would hit a man in the water, if they were hungry, even if the man had no smell of fish blood nor of fish slime on him.
"Ay," the old man said. "Galanos. Come on, Galanos."
They came.
But they did not come as the Mako had come.
One turned and went out of sight under the skiff and the old man could feel the skiff shake as he jerked and pulled on the fish.
The other watched the old man with his slitted yellow eyes and then came in fast with his half circle of jaws wide to hit the fish where he had already been bitten.
The line showed clearly on the top of his brown head and back where the brain joined the spinal cord and the old man drove the knife on the oar into the juncture, withdrew it, and drove it in again into the shark's yellow cat-like eyes.
The shark let go of the fish and slid down, swallowing what he had taken as he died.
The skiff was still shaking with the destruction the other shark was doing to the fish and the old man let go the sheet so that the skiff would swing broadside and bring the shark out from under.
When he saw the shark he leaned over the side and punched at him.
He hit only meat and the hide was set hard and he barely got the knife in.
The blow hurt not only his hands but his shoulder too.
But the shark came up fast with his head out and the old man hit him squarely in the center of his flat-topped head as his nose came out of water and lay against the fish.
The old man withdrew the blade and punched the shark exactly in the same spot again.
He still hung to the fish with his jaws hooked and the old man stabbed him in his left eye.
The shark still hung there.
"No?" the old man said and he drove the blade between the vertebrae and the brain. It was an easy shot now and he felt the cartilage sever. The old man reversed the oar and put the blade between the shark's jaws to open them. He twisted the blade and as the shark slid loose he said, "Go on, galano. Slide down a mile deep. Go see your friend, or maybe it's your mother."
The old man wiped the blade of his knife and laid down the oar.
Then he found the sheet and the sail filled and he brought the skiff onto her course.
"They must have taken a quarter of him and of the best meat," he said aloud. "I wish it were a dream and that I had never hooked him. I'm sorry about it, fish. It makes everything wrong." He stopped and he did not want to look at the fish now. Drained of blood and awash he looked the colour of the silver backing of a mirror and his stripes still showed.
"I shouldn't have gone out so far, fish," he said. "Neither for you nor for me. I'm sorry, fish."
Now, he said to himself.
Look to the lashing on the knife and see if it has been cut.
Then get your hand in order because there still is more to come.
"I wish I had a stone for the knife," the old man said after he had checked the lashing on the oar butt. "I should have brought a stone." You should have brought many things, he thought. But you did not bring them, old man. Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.
"You give me much good counsel," he said aloud. "I'm tired of it."
He held the tiller under his arm and soaked both his hands in the water as the skiff drove forward.
"God knows how much that last one took," he said. "But she's much lighter now." He did not want to think of the mutilated under-side of the fish. He knew that each of the jerking bumps of the shark had been meat torn away and that the fish now made a trail for all sharks as wide as a highway through the sea.
He was a fish to keep a man all winter, he thought.
Don't think of that.
Just rest and try to get your hands in shape to defend what is left of him.
The blood smell from my hands means nothing now with all that scent in the water.
Besides they do not bleed much.
There is nothing cut that means anything.
The bleeding may keep the left from cramping.
What can I think of now? he thought.
Nothing.
I must think of nothing and wait for the next ones.
I wish it had really been a dream, he thought.
But who knows? It might have turned out well.
The next shark that came was a single shovel-nose.
He came like a pig to the trough if a pig had a mouth so wide that you could put your head in it.
The old man let him hit the fish and then drove the knife on the oar down into his brain.
But the shark jerked backwards as he rolled and the knife blade snapped.
The old man settled himself to steer.
He did not even watch the big shark sinking slowly in the water, showing first life-size, then small, then tiny.
That always fascinated the old man.
But he did not even watch it now.
"I have the gaff now," he said. "But it will do no good. I have the two oars and the tiller and the short club."
Now they have beaten me, he thought.
I am too old to club sharks to death.
But I will try it as long as I have the oars and the short club and the tiller.
He put his hands in the water again to soak them.
It was getting late in the afternoon and he saw nothing but the sea and the sky.
There was more wind in the sky than there had been, and soon he hoped that he would see land.
"You're tired, old man," he said. "You're tired inside."
The sharks did not hit him again until just before sunset.
The old man saw the brown fins coming along the wide trail the fish must make in the water.
They were not even quartering on the scent.
They were headed straight for the skiff swimming side by side.
He jammed the tiller, made the sheet fast and reached under the stern for the club.
It was an oar handle from a broken oar sawed off to about two and a half feet in length.
He could only use it effectively with one hand because of the grip of the handle and he took good hold of it with his right hand, flexing his hand on it, as he watched the sharks come.
They were both galanos.
I must let the first one get a good hold and hit him on the point of the nose or straight across the top of the head, he thought.
The two sharks closed together and as he saw the one nearest him open his jaws and sink them into the silver side of the fish, he raised the club high and brought it down heavy and slamming onto the top of the shark's broad head.
He felt the rubbery solidity as the club came down.
But he felt the rigidity of bone too and he struck the shark once more hard across the point of the nose as he slid down from the fish.
The other shark had been in and out and now came in again with his jaws wide.
The old man could see pieces of the meat of the fish spilling white from the corner of his jaws as he bumped the fish and closed his jaws.
He swung at him and hit only the head and the shark looked at him and wrenched the meat loose.
The old man swung the club down on him again as he slipped away to swallow and hit only the heavy solid rubberiness.
"Come on, galano," the old man said. "Come in again."
The shark came in a rush and the old man hit him as he shut his jaws.
He hit him solidly and from as high up as he could raise the club.
This time he felt the bone at the base of the brain and he hit him again in the same place while the shark tore the meat loose sluggishly and slid down from the fish.
The old man watched for him to come again but neither shark showed.
Then he saw one on the surface swimming in circles.
He did not see the fin of the other.
I could not expect to kill them, he thought.
I could have in my time.
But I have hurt them both badly and neither one can feel very good.
If I could have used a bat with two hands I could have killed the first one surely.
Even now, he thought.
He did not want to look at the fish.
He knew that half of him had been destroyed.
The sun had gone down while he had been in the fight with the sharks.
"It will be dark soon," he said. "Then I should see the glow of Havana. If I am too far to the eastward I will see the lights of one of the new beaches."
I cannot be too far out now, he thought.
I hope no one has been too worried.
There is only the boy to worry, of course.
But I am sure he would have confidence.
Many of the older fishermen will worry.
Many others too, he thought.
I live in a good town.
He could not talk to the fish anymore because the fish had been ruined too badly.
Then something came into his head.
"Half fish," he said. "Fish that you were. I am sorry that I went too far out. I ruined us both. But we have killed many sharks, you and I, and ruined many others. How many did you ever kill, old fish? You do not have that spear on your head for nothing."
He liked to think of the fish and what he could do to a shark if he were swimming free.
I should have chopped the bill off to fight them with, he thought.
But there was no hatchet and then there was no knife.
But if I had, and could have lashed it to an oar butt, what a weapon.
Then we might have fought them together.
What will you do now if they come in the night? What can you do?.
"Fight them," he said. "I'll fight them until I die."
But in the dark now and no glow showing and no lights and only the wind and the steady pull of the sail he felt that perhaps he was already dead.
He put his two hands together and felt the palms.
They were not dead and he could bring the pain of life by simply opening and closing them.
He leaned his back against the stern and knew he was not dead.
His shoulders told him.
I have all those prayers I promised if I caught the fish, he thought.
But I am too tired to say them now.
I better get the sack and put it over my shoulders.
He lay in the stern and steered and watched for the glow to come in the sky.
I have half of him, he thought.
Maybe I'll have the luck to bring the forward half in.
I should have some luck.
No, he said.
You violated your luck when you went too far outside.
"Don't be silly," he said aloud. "And keep awake and steer. You may have much luck yet."
"I'd like to buy some if there's any place they sell it," he said.
What could I buy it with? he asked himself.
Could I buy it with a lost harpoon and a broken knife and two bad hands?.
"You might," he said. "You tried to buy it with eighty-four days at sea. They nearly sold it to you too."
I must not think nonsense, he thought.
Luck is a thing that comes in many forms and who can recognize her? I would take some though in any form and pay what they asked.
I wish I could see the glow from the lights, he thought.
I wish too many things.
But that is the thing I wish for now.
He tried to settle more comfortably to steer and from his pain he knew he was not dead.
He saw the reflected glare of the lights of the city at what must have been around ten o'clock at night.
They were only perceptible at first as the light is in the sky before the moon rises.
Then they were steady to see across the ocean which was rough now with the increasing breeze.
He steered inside of the glow and he thought that now, soon, he must hit the edge of the stream.
Now it is over, he thought.
They will probably hit me again.
But what can a man do against them in the dark without a weapon?.
He was stiff and sore now and his wounds and all of the strained parts of his body hurt with the cold of the night.
I hope I do not have to fight again, he thought.
I hope so much I do not have to fight again.
But by midnight he fought and this time he knew the fight was useless.
They came in a pack and he could only see the lines in the water that their fins made and their phosphorescence as they threw themselves on the fish.
He clubbed at heads and heard the jaws chop and the shaking of the skiff as they took hold below.
He clubbed desperately at what he could only feel and hear and he felt something seize the club and it was gone.
He jerked the tiller free from the rudder and beat and chopped with it, holding it in both hands and driving it down again and again.
But they were up to the bow now and driving in one after the other and together, tearing off the pieces of meat that showed glowing below the sea as they turned to come once more.
One came, finally, against the head itself and he knew that it was over.
He swung the tiller across the shark's head where the jaws were caught in the heaviness of the fish's head which would not tear.
He swung it once and twice and again.
He heard the tiller break and he lunged at the shark with the splintered butt.
He felt it go in and knowing it was sharp he drove it in again.
The shark let go and rolled away.
That was the last shark of the pack that came.
There was nothing more for them to eat.
The old man could hardly breathe now and he felt a strange taste in his mouth.
It was coppery and sweet and he was afraid of it for a moment.
But there was not much of it.
He spat into the ocean and said, "Eat that, Galanos.
And make a dream you've killed a man.
He knew he was beaten now finally and without remedy and he went back to the stern and found the jagged end of the tiller would fit in the slot of the rudder well enough for him to steer.
He settled the sack around his shoulders and put the skiff on her course.
He sailed lightly now and he had no thoughts nor any feelings of any kind.
He was past everything now and he sailed the skiff to make his home port as well and as intelligently as he could.
In the night sharks hit the carcass as someone might pick up crumbs from the table.
The old man paid no attention to them and did not pay any attention to anything except steering.
He only noticed how lightly and how well the skiff sailed now there was no great weight beside her.
She's good, he thought.
She is sound and not harmed in any way except for the tiller.
That is easily replaced.
He could feel he was inside the current now and he could see the lights of the beach colonies along the shore.
He knew where he was now and it was nothing to get home.
The wind is our friend, anyway, he thought.
Then he added, sometimes.
And the great sea with our friends and our enemies.
And bed, he thought.
Bed is my friend.
Just bed, he thought.
Bed will be a great thing.
It is easy when you are beaten, he thought.
I never knew how easy it was.
And what beat you, he thought.
"Nothing," he said aloud. "I went out too far."
When he sailed into the little harbour the lights of the Terrace were out and he knew everyone was in bed.
The breeze had risen steadily and was blowing strongly now.
It was quiet in the harbour though and he sailed up onto the little patch of shingle below the rocks.
There was no one to help him so he pulled the boat up as far as he could.
Then he stepped out and made her fast to a rock.
He unstepped the mast and furled the sail and tied it.
Then he shouldered the mast and started to climb.
It was then he knew the depth of his tiredness.
He stopped for a moment and looked back and saw in the reflection from the street light the great tail of the fish standing up well behind the skiff's stern.
He saw the white naked line of his backbone and the dark mass of the head with the projecting bill and all the nakedness between.
He started to climb again and at the top he fell and lay for some time with the mast across his shoulder.
He tried to get up.
But it was too difficult and he sat there with the mast on his shoulder and looked at the road.
A cat passed on the far side going about its business and the old man watched it.
Then he just watched the road.
Finally he put the mast down and stood up.
He picked the mast up and put it on his shoulder and started up the road.
He had to sit down five times before he reached his shack.
Inside the shack he leaned the mast against the wall.
In the dark he found a water bottle and took a drink.
Then he lay down on the bed.
He pulled the blanket over his shoulders and then over his back and legs and he slept face down on the newspapers with his arms out straight and the palms of his hands up.
He was asleep when the boy looked in the door in the morning.
It was blowing so hard that the drifting-boats would not be going out and the boy had slept late and then come to the old man's shack as he had come each morning.
The boy saw that the old man was breathing and then he saw the old man's hands and he started to cry.
He went out very quietly to go to bring some coffee and all the way down the road he was crying.
Many fishermen were around the skiff looking at what was lashed beside it and one was in the water, his trousers rolled up, measuring the skeleton with a length of line.
The boy did not go down.
He had been there before and one of the fishermen was looking after the skiff for him.
"How is he?" one of the fishermen shouted.
"Sleeping," the boy called. He did not care that they saw him crying. "Let no one disturb him."
"He was eighteen feet from nose to tail," the fisherman who was measuring him called.
"I believe it," the boy said.
He went into the Terrace and asked for a can of coffee.
"Hot and with plenty of milk and sugar in it."
"Anything more?"
"No. Afterwards I will see what he can eat."
"What a fish it was," the proprietor said. "There has never been such a fish. Those were two fine fish you took yesterday too."
"Damn my fish," the boy said and he started to cry again.
"Do you want a drink of any kind?" the proprietor asked.
"No," the boy said. "Tell them not to bother Santiago. I'll be back."
"Tell him how sorry I am."
"Thanks," the boy said.
The boy carried the hot can of coffee up to the old man's shack and sat by him until he woke.
Once it looked as though he were waking.
But he had gone back into heavy sleep and the boy had gone across the road to borrow some wood to heat the coffee.
Finally the old man woke.
"Don't sit up," the boy said. "Drink this." He poured some of the coffee in a glass.
The old man took it and drank it.
"They beat me, Manolin," he said. "They truly beat me."
"He didn't beat you. Not the fish."
"No. Truly. It was afterwards."
"Pedrico is looking after the skiff and the gear. What do you want done with the head?"
"Let Pedrico chop it up to use in fish traps."
"And the spear?"
"You keep it if you want it."
"I want it," the boy said. "Now we must make our plans about the other things."
"Did they search for me?"
"Of course. With coast guard and with planes."
"The ocean is very big and a skiff is small and hard to see," the old man said. He noticed how pleasant it was to have someone to talk to instead of speaking only to himself and to the sea. "I missed you," he said. "What did you catch?"
"One the first day. One the second and two the third."
"Very good."
"Now we fish together again."
"No. I am not lucky. I am not lucky anymore."
"The hell with luck," the boy said. "I'll bring the luck with me."
"What will your family say?"
"I do not care. I caught two yesterday. But we will fish together now for I still have much to learn."
"We must get a good killing lance and always have it on board. You can make the blade from a spring leaf from an old Ford. We can grind it in Guanabacoa. It should be sharp and not tempered so it will break. My knife broke."
"I'll get another knife and have the spring ground. How many days of heavy brisa have we?"
"Maybe three. Maybe more."
"I will have everything in order," the boy said. "You get your hands well old man."
"I know how to care for them. In the night I spat something strange and felt something in my chest was broken."
"Get that well too," the boy said. "Lie down, old man, and I will bring you your clean shirt. And something to eat."
"Bring any of the papers of the time that I was gone," the old man said.
"You must get well fast for there is much that I can learn and you can teach me everything. How much did you suffer?"
"Plenty," the old man said.
"I'll bring the food and the papers," the boy said. "Rest well, old man. I will bring stuff from the drug-store for your hands."
"Don't forget to tell Pedrico the head is his."
"No. I will remember."
As the boy went out the door and down the worn coral rock road he was crying again.
That afternoon there was a party of tourists at the Terrace and looking down in the water among the empty beer cans and dead barracudas a woman saw a great long white spine with a huge tail at the end that lifted and swung with the tide while the east wind blew a heavy steady sea outside the entrance to the harbour.
"What's that?" she asked a waiter and pointed to the long backbone of the great fish that was now just garbage waiting to go out with the tide.
"Tiburon," the waiter said, "Eshark." He was meaning to explain what had happened.
"I didn't know sharks had such handsome, beautifully formed tails."
"I didn't either," her male companion said.
Up the road, in his shack, the old man was sleeping again.
He was still sleeping on his face and the boy was sitting by him watching him.
The old man was dreaming about the lions.
GREEN HILLS OF AFRICA.
CHAPTER ONE.
We were sitting in the blind that Wanderobo hunters had built of twigs and branches at the edge of the salt-lick when we heard the motor-lorry coming.
At first it was far away and no one could tell what the noise was.
Then it was stopped and we hoped it had been nothing or perhaps only the wind.
Then it moved slowly nearer, unmistakable now, louder and louder until, agonizing in a clank of loud irregular explosions, it passed close behind us to go on up the road.
The theatrical one of the two trackers stood up.
‘It is finished,’ he said.
I put my hand to my mouth and motioned him down.
[Pg 11]‘It is finished,’ he said again and spread his arms wide.
I had never liked him and I liked him less now.
‘After,’ I whispered.
M’Cola shook his head.
I looked at his bald black skull and he turned his face a little so that I saw the thin Chinese hairs at the corners of his mouth.
‘No good,’ he said.
‘Hapana m’uzuri.
‘Wait a little,’ I told him.
He bent his head down again so that it would not show above the dead branches and we sat there in the dust of the hole until it was too dark to see the front sight on my rifle; but nothing more came.
The theatrical tracker was impatient and restless.
[Pg 12] A little before the last of the light was gone he whispered to M’Cola that it was now too dark to shoot.
‘Shut up, you,’ M’Cola told him.
‘The Bwana can shoot after you cannot see.
The other tracker, the educated one, gave another demonstration of his education by scratching his name, Abdullah, on the black skin of his leg with a sharp twig.
I watched without admiration and M’Cola looked at the word without a shadow of expression on his face.
After a while the tracker scratched it out.
Finally I made a last sight against what was left of the light and saw it was no use, even with the large aperture.
M’Cola was watching.
‘No good,’ I said.
‘Yes,’ he agreed, in Swahili.
‘Go to camp?’.
‘Yes.
We stood up and made our way out of the blind and out through the trees, walking on the sandy loam, feeling our way between trees and under branches, back to the road.
A mile along the road was the car.
As we came alongside, Kamau, the driver, put the lights on.
The lorry had spoiled it.
That afternoon we had left the car up the road and approached the salt-lick very carefully.
There had been a little rain, the day before, though not enough to flood the lick, which was simply an opening in the trees with a patch of earth worn into deep circles and grooved at the edges with hollows where the animals had licked the dirt for salt, and we had seen long, heart-shaped, fresh tracks of four greater kudu bulls that had been on the salt the night before, as well[Pg 13] as many newly pressed tracks of lesser kudu.
There was also a rhino who, from the tracks and the kicked-up mound of strawy dung, came there each night.
The blind had been built at close arrow-shot of the lick, and sitting, leaning back, knees high, heads low, in a hollow half full of ashes and dust, watching through the dried leaves and thin branches I had seen a lesser kudu bull come out of the brush to the edge of the opening where the salt was and stand there, heavy-necked, grey, and handsome, the horns spiralled against the sun while I sighted on his chest and then refused the shot, wanting not to frighten the greater kudu that should surely come at dusk.
But before we ever heard the lorry the bull had heard it and run off into the trees, and everything else that had been moving, in the bush on the flats, or coming down from the small hills through the trees, coming toward the salt, had halted at that exploding, clanking sound.
They would come, later, in the dark; but then it would be too late.
So now, going along the sandy track of the road in the car, the lights picking out the eyes of night birds that squatted close on the sand until the bulk of the car was on them and they rose in soft panic; passing the fires of the travellers that all moved to the westward by day along this road, abandoning the famine country that was ahead of us; me sitting, the butt of my rifle on my foot, the barrel in the crook of my left arm, a flask of whisky between my knees, pouring the whisky into a tin cup and passing it over my shoulder in the dark for M’Cola to pour water into it from the canteen, drinking this, the[Pg 14] first one of the day, the finest one there is, and looking at the thick bush we passed in the dark, feeling the cool wind of the night and smelling the good smell of Africa, I was altogether happy.
Then ahead we saw a big fire and as we came up and passed, I made out a lorry beside the road.
I told Kamau to stop and go back and as we backed into the firelight there was a short, bandy-legged man with a Tyrolese hat, leather shorts, and an open shirt standing before an unhooded engine in a crowd of natives.
‘Can we help?’ I asked him.
‘No,’ he said.
‘Unless you are a mechanic.
It has taken a dislike to me.
All engines dislike me.
‘Do you think it could be the timer? It sounded as though it might be a timing knock when you went past us.
‘I think it is much worse than that.
It sounds to be something very bad.
‘If you can get to our camp we have a mechanic.
‘How far is it?’.
‘About twenty miles.
‘In the morning I will try it.
Now I am afraid to make it go farther with that noise of death inside.
It is trying to die because it dislikes me.
Well, I dislike it too.
But if I die it would not annoy it.
‘Will you have a drink?’ I held out the flask.
‘Hemingway is my name.
‘Kandisky,’ he said and bowed.
‘Hemingway is a name I have heard.
Where? Where have I heard it? Oh, yes.
The dichter.
You know Hemingway the poet?’.
‘Where did you read him?’.
[Pg 15]‘In the Querschnitt.
‘That is me,’ I said, very pleased.
The Querschnitt was a German magazine I had written some rather obscene poems for, and published a long story in, years before I could sell anything in America.
‘This is very strange,’ the man in the Tyrolese hat said.
‘Tell me, what do you think of Ringelnatz?’.
‘He is splendid.
‘So.
You like Ringelnatz.
Good.
What do you think of Heinrich Mann?’.
‘He is no good.
‘You believe it?’.
‘All I know is that I cannot read him.
‘He is no good at all.
I see we have things in common.
What are you doing here?’.
‘Shooting.
‘Not ivory, I hope.
‘No.
For kudu.
‘Why should any man shoot a kudu? You, an intelligent man, a poet, to shoot kudu.
‘I haven’t shot any yet,’ I said.
‘But we’ve been hunting them hard now for ten days.
We would have got one to-night if it hadn’t been for your lorry.
‘That poor lorry.
But you should hunt for a year.
At the end of that time you have shot everything and you are sorry for it.
To hunt for one special animal is nonsense.
Why do you do it?’.
‘I like to do it.
‘Of course, if you like to do it.
Tell me, what do you really think of Rilke?’.
[Pg 16]‘I have read only the one thing.
‘Which?’.
‘The Cornet.
‘You liked it?’.
‘Yes.
‘I have no patience with it.
It is snobbery.
Valéry, yes.
I see the point of Valéry; although there is much snobbery too.
Well at least you do not kill elephants.
‘I’d kill a big enough one.
‘How big?’.
‘A seventy-pounder.
Maybe smaller.
‘I see there are things we do not agree on.
But it is a pleasure to meet one of the great old Querschnitt group.
Tell me what is Joyce like? I have not the money to buy it.
Sinclair Lewis is nothing.
I bought it.
Tell me to-morrow.
You do not mind if I am camped near? You are with friends? You have a white hunter?’.
‘With my wife.
We would be delighted.
Yes, a white hunter.
‘Why is he not out with you?’.
‘He believes you should hunt kudu alone.
‘It is better not to hunt them at all.
What is he? English?’.
‘Yes.
‘Bloody English?’.
‘No.
Very nice.
You will like him.
‘You must go.
I must not keep you.
Perhaps I will see you to-morrow.
It was very strange that we should meet.
[Pg 17]‘Yes,’ I said.
‘Have them look at the lorry to-morrow.
Anything we can do?’.
‘Good night,’ he said.
‘Good trip.
‘Good night,’ I said.
We started off and I saw him walking toward the fire waving an arm at the natives.
I had not asked him why he had twenty up-country natives with him, nor where he was going.
Looking back, I had asked him nothing.
I do not like to ask questions, and where I was brought up it was not polite.
But here we had not seen a white man for two weeks, not since we had left Babati to go south, and then to run into one on this road where you met only an occasional Indian trader and the steady migration of the natives out of the famine country, to have him look like a caricature of Benchley in Tyrolean costume, to have him know your name, to call you a poet, to have read the Querschnitt, to be an admirer of Joachim Ringelnatz and to want to talk about Rilke, was too fantastic to deal with.
So, just then, to crown this fantasy, the lights of the car showed three tall, conical, mounds of something smoking in the road ahead.
I motioned to Kamau to stop, and putting on the brakes we skidded just short of them.
They were from two to three feet high and when I touched one it was quite warm.
‘Tembo,’ M’Cola said.
It was dung from elephants that had just crossed the road, and in the cold of the evening you could see it steaming.
In a little while we were in camp.
Next morning I was up and away to another salt-lick before daylight.
There was a kudu bull on the lick when[Pg 18] we approached through the trees and he gave a loud bark, like a dog’s but higher in pitch and sharply throaty, and was gone, making no noise at first, then crashing in the brush when he was well away; and we never saw him.
This lick had an impossible approach.
Trees grew around its open area so that it was as though the game were in the blind and you had to come to them across the open.
The only way to make it would have been for one man to go alone and crawl and then it would be impossible to get any sort of a close shot through the interlacing trees until you were within twenty yards.
Of course once you were inside the protecting trees, and in the blind, you were wonderfully placed, for anything that came to the salt had to come out in the open twenty-five yards from any cover.
But though we stayed until eleven o’clock nothing came.
We smoothed the dust of the lick carefully with our feet so that any new tracks would show when we came back again and walked the two miles to the road.
Being hunted, the game had learned to come only at night and leave before daylight.
One bull had stayed and our spooking him that morning would make it even more difficult now.
This was the tenth day we had been hunting greater kudu and I had not seen a mature bull yet.
We had only three days more because the rains were moving north each day from Rhodesia and unless we were prepared to stay where we were through the rains we must be out as far as Handeni before they came.
We had set February 17th as the last safe date to leave.
Every morning now it took the heavy, woolly sky an hour[Pg 19] or so longer to clear and you could feel the rains coming, as they moved steadily north, as surely as though you watched them on a chart.
Now it is pleasant to hunt something that you want very much over a long period of time, being outwitted, out-manœuvred, and failing at the end of each day, but having the hunt and knowing every time you are out that, sooner or later, your luck will change and that you will get the chance that you are seeking.
But it is not pleasant to have a time limit by which you must get your kudu or perhaps never get it, nor even see one.
It is not the way hunting should be.
It is too much like those boys who used to be sent to Paris with two years in which to make good as writers or painters, after which, if they had not made good, they could go home and into their fathers’ businesses.
The way to hunt is for as long as you live against as long as there is such and such an animal; just as the way to paint is as long as there is you and colours and canvas, and to write as long as you can live and there is pencil and paper or ink or any machine to do it with, or anything you care to write about, and you feel a fool, and you are a fool, to do it any other way.
But here we were, now, caught by time, by the season, and by the running out of our money, so that what should have been as much fun to do each day whether you killed or not was being forced into that most exciting perversion of life; the necessity of accomplishing something in less time than should truly be allowed for its doing.
So, coming in at noon, up since two hours before daylight, with only three days left, I was starting to be nervous[Pg 20] about it, and there, at the table under the dining tent fly, talking away, was Kandisky of the Tyrolese pants.
I had forgotten all about him.
‘Hello.
Hello,’ he said.
‘No success? Nothing doing? Where is the kudu?’.
‘He coughed once and went away,’ I said.
‘Hello, girl.
She smiled.
She was worried too.
The two of them had been listening since daylight for a shot.
Listening all the time, even when our guest had arrived; listening while writing letters, listening while reading, listening when Kandisky came back and talked.
‘You did not shoot him?’.
‘No.
Nor see him.
’ I saw that Pop was worried too, and a little nervous.
There had evidently been considerable talking going on.
‘Have a beer, Colonel,’ he said to me.
‘We spooked one,’ I reported.
‘No chance of a shot.
There were plenty of tracks.
Nothing more came.
The wind was blowing around.
Ask the boys about it.
‘As I was telling Colonel Phillips,’ Kandisky began, shifting his leather-breeched behind and crossing one heavy-calved, well-haired, bare leg over the other, ‘you must not stay here too long.
You must realize the rains are coming.
There is one stretch of twelve miles beyond here you can never get through if it rains.
It is impossible.
‘So he’s been telling me,’ Pop said.
‘I’m a Mister, by the way.
We use these military titles as nicknames.
No offence if you’re a colonel yourself.
’ Then to me, ‘Damn[Pg 21] these salt-licks.
If you’d leave them alone you’d get one.
‘They ball it all up,’ I agreed.
‘You’re so sure of a shot sooner or later on the lick.
‘Hunt the hills too.
‘I’ll hunt them, Pop.
‘What is killing a kudu, anyway?’ Kandisky asked.
‘You should not take it so seriously.
It is nothing.
In a year you kill twenty.
‘Best not say anything about that to the game department, though,’ Pop said.
‘You misunderstand,’ Kandisky said.
‘I mean in a year a man could.
Of course no man would wish to.
‘Absolutely,’ Pop said.
‘If he lived in kudu country, he could.
They’re the commonest big antelope in this bush country.
It’s just that when you want to see them you don’t.
‘I kill nothing, you understand,’ Kandisky told us.
‘Why are you not more interested in the natives?’.
‘We are,’ my wife assured him.
‘They are really interesting.
Listen.
’ Kandisky said, and he spoke on to her.
‘The hell of it is,’ I said to Pop, ‘when I’m in the hills I’m sure the bastards are down there on the salt.
The cows are in the hills but I don’t believe the bulls are with them now.
Then you get there in the evening and there are the tracks.
They have been on the lousy salt.
I think they come any time.
‘Probably they do.
‘I’m sure we get different bulls there.
They probably only come to the salt every couple of days.
Some are[Pg 22] certainly spooked because Karl shot that one.
If he’d only killed it clean instead of following it through the whole damn countryside.
Christ, if he’d only kill any damn thing clean.
Other new ones will come in.
All we have to do is to wait them out, though.
Of course they can’t all know about it.
But he’s spooked this country to hell.
‘He gets so very excited,’ Pop said.
‘But he’s a good lad.
He made a beautiful shot on that leopard, you know.
You don’t want them killed any cleaner than that.
Let it quiet down again.
‘Sure.
I don’t mean anything when I curse him.
‘What about staying in the blind all day?’.
‘The damned wind started to go round in a circle.
It blew our scent every direction.
No use to sit there broadcasting it.
If the damn wind would hold.
Abdullah took an ash can to-day.
‘I saw him starting off with it.
There wasn’t a bit of wind when we stalked the salt and there was just light to shoot.
He tried the wind with the ashes all the way.
I went alone with Abdullah and left the others behind and we went quietly.
I had on these crêpe-soled boots and it’s soft cotton dirt.
The bastard spooked at fifty yards.
‘Did you ever see their ears?’.
‘Did I ever see their ears? If I can see his ears, the skinner can work on him.
‘They’re bastards,’ Pop said.
‘I hate this salt-lick business.
They’re not as smart as we think.
The trouble is you’re working on them where they are smart.
They’ve been shot at there ever since there’s been salt.
[Pg 23]‘That’s what makes it fun,’ I said.
‘I’d be glad to do it for a month.
I like to hunt sitting on my tail.
No sweat.
No nothing.
Sit there and catch flies and feed them to the ant lions in the dust.
I like it.
But what about the time?’.
‘That’s it.
The time.
‘So,’ Kandisky was saying to my wife.
‘That is what you should see.
The big ngomas.
The big native dance festivals.
The real ones.
‘Listen,’ I said to Pop.
‘The other lick, the one I was at last night, is fool-proof except for being near that bloody road.
‘The trackers say it is really the property of the lesser kudu.
It’s a long way too.
It’s eighty miles there and back.
‘I know.
But there were four big bull tracks.
It’s certain.
If it wasn’t for that lorry last night.
What about staying there to-night! Then I’d get the night and the early morning and give this lick a rest.
There’s a big rhino there too.
Big track, anyway.
‘Good,’ Pop said.
‘Shoot the rhino too.
’ He hated to have anything killed except what we were after, no killing on the side, no ornamental killing, no killing to kill, only when you wanted it more than you wanted not to kill it, only when getting it was necessary to his being first in his trade, and I saw he was offering up the rhino to please me.
‘I won’t kill him unless he’s good,’ I promised.
‘Shoot the bastard,’ Pop said, making a gift of him.
‘Ah, Pop,’ I said.
[Pg 24]‘Shoot him,’ said Pop.
‘You’ll enjoy it, being by yourself.
You can sell the horn if you don’t want it.
You’ve still one on your licence.
‘So,’ said Kandisky.
‘You have arranged a plan of campaign? You have decided on how to outwit the poor animals?’.
‘Yes,’ I said.
‘How is the lorry?’.
‘That lorry is finished,’ the Austrian said.
‘In a way I am glad.
It was too much of a symbol.
It was all that remained of my shamba.
Now everything is gone and it is much simpler.
‘What is a shamba?’ asked P.
, my wife.
‘I’ve been hearing about them for months.
I’m afraid to ask about those words every one uses.
‘A plantation,’ he said.
‘It is all gone except that lorry.
With the lorry I carry labourers to the shamba of an Indian.
It is a very rich Indian who raises sisal.
I am a manager for this Indian.
An Indian can make a profit from a sisal shamba.
‘From anything,’ Pop said.
‘Yes.
Where we fail, where we would starve, he makes money.
This Indian is very intelligent, however.
He values me.
I represent European organization.
I come now from organizing recruitment of the natives.
This takes time.
It is impressive.
I have been away from my family for three months.
The organization is organized.
You do it in a week as easily, but it is not so impressive.
‘And your wife?’ asked mine.
‘She waits at my house, the house of the manager, with my daughter.
[Pg 25]‘Does she love you very much?’ my wife asked.
‘She must, or she would be gone long ago.
‘How old is the daughter?’.
‘She is thirteen now.
‘It must be very nice to have a daughter.
‘You cannot know how nice it is.
It is like a second wife.
My wife knows now all I think, all I say, all I believe, all I can do, all that I cannot do and cannot be.
I know also about my wife—completely.
But now there is always someone you do not know, who does not know you, who loves you in ignorance and is strange to you both.
Some one very attractive that is yours and not yours and that makes the conversation more—how shall I say? Yes, it is like—what do you call—having here with you—with the two of you—yes there—it is the Heinz Tomato Ketchup on the daily food.
‘That’s very good,’ I said.
‘We have books,’ he said.
‘I cannot buy new books now but we can always talk.
Ideas and conversation are very interesting.
We discuss all things.
Everything.
We have a very interesting mental life.
Formerly, with the shamba, we had the Querschnitt.
That gave you a feeling of belonging, of being made a part of, to a very brilliant group of people.
The people one would see if one saw whom one wished to see.
You know all of those people? You must know them.
‘Some of them.
’ I said.
‘Some in Paris.
Some in Berlin.
I did not wish to destroy anything this man had, and so I did not go into those brilliant people in detail.
[Pg 26]‘They’re marvellous,’ I said, lying.
‘I envy you to know them,’ he said.
‘And tell me, who is the greatest writer in America?’.
‘My husband,’ said my wife.
‘No.
I do not mean for you to speak from family pride.
I mean who really? Certainly not Upton Sinclair.
Certainly not Sinclair Lewis.
Who is your Thomas Mann? Who is your Valéry?’.
‘We do not have great writers,’ I said.
‘Something happens to our good writers at a certain age.
I can explain but it is quite long and may bore you.
‘Please explain,’ he said.
‘This is what I enjoy.
This is the best part of life.
The life of the mind.
This is not killing kudu.
‘You haven’t heard it yet,’ I said.
‘Ah, but I can see it coming.
You must take more beer to loosen your tongue.
‘It’s loose,’ I told him.
‘It’s always too loose.
But you don’t drink anything.
‘No, I never drink.
It is not good for the mind.
It is unnecessary.
But tell me.
Please tell me.
‘Well,’ I said, ‘we have had, in America, skilful writers.
Poe is a skilful writer.
It is skilful, marvellously constructed, and it is dead.
We have had writers of rhetoric who had the good fortune to find a little, in a chronicle of another man and from voyaging, of how things, actual things, can be, whales for instance, and this knowledge is wrapped in the rhetoric like plums in a pudding.
Occasionally it is there, alone, unwrapped in pudding, and it is good.
This is Melville.
But the people who praise it,[Pg 27] praise it for the rhetoric which is not important.
They put a mystery in which is not there.
‘Yes,’ he said.
‘I see.
But it is the mind working, its ability to work, which makes the rhetoric.
Rhetoric is the blue sparks from the dynamo.
‘Sometimes.
And sometimes it is only blue sparks, and what is the dynamo driving?’.
‘So.
Go on.
‘I’ve forgotten.
‘No.
Go on.
Do not pretend to be stupid.
‘Did you ever get up before daylight.
‘Every morning,’ he said.
‘Go on.
‘All right.
There were others who wrote like exiled English colonials from an England of which they were never a part to a newer England that they were making.
Very good men with the small, dried, and excellent wisdom of Unitarians; men of letters; Quakers with a sense of humour.
‘Who were these?’.
‘Emerson, Hawthorne, Whittier, and Company.
All our early classics who did not know that a new classic does not bear any resemblance to the classics that have preceded it.
It can steal from anything that it is better than, anything that is not a classic, all classics do that.
Some writers are only born to help another writer to write one sentence.
But it cannot derive from or resemble a previous classic.
Also all these men were gentlemen, or wished to be.
They were all very respectable.
They did not use the words that people always have used in speech, the words that survive in language.
[Pg 28] Nor would you gather that they had bodies.
They had minds, yes.
Nice, dry, clean minds.
This is all very dull, I would not state it except that you ask for it.
‘Go on.
‘There is one at that time that is supposed to be really good.
Thoreau.
I cannot tell you about it because I have not yet been able to read it.
But that means nothing because I cannot read other naturalists unless they are being extremely accurate and not literary.
Naturalists should all work alone and some one else should correlate their findings for them.
Writers should work alone.
They should see each other only after their work is done, and not too often then.
Otherwise they become like writers in New York.
All angleworms in a bottle, trying to derive knowledge and nourishment from their own contact and from the bottle.
Sometimes the bottle is shaped art, sometimes economics, sometimes economic-religion.
But once they are in the bottle they stay there.
They are lonesome outside of the bottle.
They do not want to be lonesome.
They are afraid to be alone in their beliefs and no woman would love any of them enough so that they could kill their lonesomeness in that woman, or pool it with hers, or make something with her that makes the rest unimportant.
‘But what about Thoreau?’.
‘You’ll have to read him.
Maybe I’ll be able to later.
I can do nearly everything later.
‘Better have some more beer, Papa.
‘All right.
‘What about the good writers?’.
[Pg 29]‘The good writers are Henry James, Stephen Crane, and Mark Twain.
That’s not the order they’re good in.
There is no order for good writers.
‘Mark Twain is a humorist.
The others I do not know.
‘All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn.
If you read it you must stop where the Nigger Jim is stolen from the boys.
That is the real end.
The rest is just cheating.
But it’s the best book we’ve had.
All American writing comes from that.
There was nothing before.
There has been nothing as good since.
‘What about the others?’.
‘Crane wrote two fine stories.
The Open Boat and The Blue Hotel.
The last one is the better.
‘And what happened to him?’.
‘He died.
That’s simple.
He was dying from the start.
‘But the other two?’.
‘They both lived to be old men but they did not get any wiser as they got older.
I don’t know what they really wanted.
You see we make our writers into something very strange.
‘I do not understand.
‘We destroy them in many ways.
First, economically.
They make money.
It is only by hazard that a writer makes money although good books always make money eventually.
Then our writers when they have made some money increase their standard of living and they are caught.
They have to write to keep up their establishments, their wives, and so on, and they write slop.
It[Pg 30] is slop not on purpose but because it is hurried.
Because they write when there is nothing to say or no water in the well.
Because they are ambitious.
Then, once they have betrayed themselves, they justify it and you get more slop.
Or else they read the critics.
If they believe the critics when they say they are great then they must believe them when they say they are rotten and they lose confidence.
At present we have two good writers who cannot write because they have lost confidence through reading critics.
If they wrote, sometimes it would be good and sometimes not so good and sometimes it would be quite bad, but the good would get out.
But they have read the critics and they must write masterpieces.
The masterpieces the critics said they wrote.
They weren’t masterpieces, of course.
They were just quite good books.
So now they cannot write at all.
The critics have made them impotent.
‘Who are these writers?’.
‘Their names would mean nothing to you and by now they may have written, become frightened, and be impotent again.
‘But what is it that happens to American writers? Be definite.
‘I was not here in the old days so I cannot tell you about them, but now there are various things.
At a certain age the men writers change into Old Mother Hubbard.
The women writers become Joan of Arc without the fighting.
They become leaders.
It doesn’t matter who they lead.
If they do not have followers they invent them.
It is useless for those selected as followers[Pg 31] to protest.
They are accused of disloyalty.
Oh, hell.
There are too many things happen to them.
That is one thing.
The others try to save their souls with what they write.
That is an easy way out.
Others are ruined by the first money, the first praise, the first attack, the first time they find they cannot write, or the first time they cannot do anything else, or else they get frightened and join organizations that do their thinking for them.
Or they do not know what they want.
Henry James wanted to make money.
He never did, of course.
‘And you?’.
‘I am interested in other things.
I have a good life but I must write because if I do not write a certain amount I do not enjoy the rest of my life.
‘And what do you want?’.
‘To write as well as I can and learn as I go along.
At the same time I have my life which I enjoy and which is a damned good life.
‘Hunting kudu?’.
‘Yes.
Hunting kudu and many other things.
‘What other things?’.
‘Plenty of other things.
‘And you know what you want?’.
‘Yes.
‘You really like to do this, what you do now, this silliness of kudu?’.
‘Just as much as I like to be in the Prado.
‘One is not better than the other?’.
‘One is as necessary as the other.
There are other things, too.
[Pg 32]‘Naturally.
There must be.
But this sort of thing means something to you, really?’.
‘Truly.
‘And you know what you want?’.
‘Absolutely, and I get it all the time.
‘But it takes money.
‘I could always make money, and besides I have been very lucky.
‘Then you are happy?’.
‘Except when I think of other people.
‘Then you think of other people?’.
‘Oh, yes.
‘But you do nothing for them?’.
‘No.
‘Nothing?’.
‘Maybe a little.
‘Do you think your writing is worth doing—as an end in itself?’.
‘Oh, yes.
‘You are sure?’.
‘Very sure.
‘That must be very pleasant.
‘It is,’ I said.
‘It is the one altogether pleasant thing about it.
‘This is getting awfully serious,’ my wife said.
‘It’s a damned serious subject.
‘You see, he is really serious about something,’ Kandisky said.
‘I knew he must be serious on something besides kudu.
‘The reason everyone now tries to avoid it, to deny[Pg 33] that it is important, to make it seem vain to try to do it, is because it is so difficult.
Too many factors must combine to make it possible.
‘What is this now?’.
‘The kind of writing that can be done.
How far prose can be carried if anyone is serious enough and has luck.
There is a fourth and fifth dimension that can be gotten.
‘You believe it?’.
‘I know it.
‘And if a writer can get this?’.
‘Then nothing else matters.
It is more important than anything he can do.
The chances are, of course, that he will fail.
But there is a chance that he succeeds.
‘But that is poetry you are talking about.
‘No.
It is much more difficult than poetry.
It is a prose that has never been written.
But it can be written, without tricks and without cheating.
With nothing that will go bad afterwards.
‘And why has it not been written?’.
‘Because there are too many factors.
First, there must be talent, much talent.
Talent such as Kipling had.
Then there must be discipline.
The discipline of Flaubert.
Then there must be the conception of what it can be and an absolute conscience as unchanging as the standard meter in Paris, to prevent faking.
Then the writer must be intelligent and disinterested and above all he must survive.
Try to get all these in one person and have him come through all the influences that press on a writer.
The hardest thing, because time is so[Pg 34] short, is for him to survive and get his work done.
But I would like us to have such a writer and to read what he would write.
What do you say? Should we talk about something else?’.
‘It is interesting what you say.
Naturally I do not agree with everything.
‘Naturally.
‘What about a gimlet?’ Pop asked.
‘Don’t you think a gimlet might help?’.
‘Tell me first what are the things, the actual, concrete things that harm a writer?’.
I was tired of the conversation which was becoming an interview.
So I would make it an interview and finish it.
The necessity to put a thousand intangibles into a sentence, now, before lunch, was too bloody.
‘Politics, women, drink, money, ambition.
And the lack of politics, women, drink, money and ambition,’ I said profoundly.
‘He’s getting much too easy now,’ Pop said.
‘But drink.
I do not understand about that.
That has always seemed silly to me.
I understand it as a weakness.
‘It is a way of ending a day.
It has great benefits.
Don’t you ever want to change your ideas?’.
‘Let’s have one,’ Pop said.
‘M’Wendi!’.
Pop never drank before lunch except as a mistake and I knew he was trying to help me out.
‘Let’s all have a gimlet,’ I said.
‘I never drink,’ Kandisky said.
‘I will go to the lorry and fetch some fresh butter for lunch.
It is fresh from[Pg 35] Kandoa, unsalted.
Very good.
To-night we will have a special dish of Viennese dessert.
My cook has learned to make it very well.
He went off and my wife said: ‘You were getting awfully profound.
What was that about all these women?’.
‘What women?’.
‘When you were talking about women.
‘The hell with them,’ I said.
‘Those are the ones you get involved with when you’re drunk.
‘So that’s what you do.
‘No.
‘I don’t get involved with people when I’m drunk.
‘Come, come,’ said Pop.
‘We’re none of us ever drunk.
My God, that man can talk.
‘He didn’t have a chance to talk after B’wana M’Kumba started.
‘I did have verbal dysentery,’ I said.
‘What about his lorry? Can we tow it in without ruining ours?’.
‘I think so,’ Pop said.
‘When ours comes back from Handeni.
At lunch under the green fly of the dining-tent, in the shade of a big tree, the wind blowing, the fresh butter much admired, Grant’s gazelle chops, mashed potatoes, green corn, and then mixed fruit for dessert, Kandisky told us why the East Indians were taking the country over.
‘You see, during the war they sent the Indian troops to fight here.
To keep them out of India because they[Pg 36] feared another mutiny.
They promised the Aga Khan that because they fought in Africa, Indians could come freely to settle and for business afterwards.
They cannot break that promise and now the Indians have taken the country over from the Europeans.
They live on nothing and they send all the money back to India.
When they have made enough to go home they leave, bringing out their poor relations to take over from them and continue to exploit the country.
Pop said nothing.
He would not argue with a guest at table.
‘It is the Aga Khan,’ Kandisky said.
‘You are an American.
You know nothing of these combinations.
‘Were you with Von Lettöw?’ Pop asked him.
‘From the start,’ Kandisky said.
‘Until the end.
‘He was a great fighter,’ Pop said.
‘I have great admiration for him.
‘You fought?’ Kandisky asked.
‘Yes.
‘I do not care for Lettöw,’ Kandisky said.
‘He fought, yes.
No one ever better.
When we wanted quinine he would order it captured.
All supplies the same.
But afterwards he cared nothing for his men.
After the war I am in Germany.
I go to see about indemnification for my property.
"You are an Austrian," they say.
"You must go through Austrian channels.
" So I go to Austria.
"But why did you fight?" they ask me.
"You cannot hold us responsible.
Suppose you go to fight in China.
That is your own affair.
We cannot do anything for you.
[Pg 37]‘"But I went as a patriot," I say, very foolishly.
"I fight where I can because I am an Austrian and I know my duty.
" "Yes," they say.
"That is very beautiful.
But you cannot hold us responsible for your noble sentiments.
" So they passed me from one to the other and nothing.
Still I love the country very much.
I have lost everything here but I have more than anyone has in Europe.
To me it is always interesting.
The natives and the language.
I have many books of notes on them.
Then too, in reality, I am a king here.
It is very pleasant.
Waking in the morning I extend one foot and the boy places the sock on it.
When I am ready I extend the other foot and he adjusts the other sock.
I step from under the mosquito bar into my drawers which are held for me.
Don’t you think that is very marvellous?’.
‘It’s marvellous.
‘When you come back another time we must take a safari to study the natives.
And shoot nothing, or only to eat.
Look, I will show you a dance and sing a song.
Crouched, elbows lifting and falling, knees humping, he shuffled around the table, singing.
Undoubtedly it was very fine.
‘That is only one of a thousand,’ he said.
‘Now I must go for a time.
You will be sleeping.
‘There’s no hurry.
Stay around.
‘No.
Surely you will be sleeping.
I also.
I will take the butter to keep it cool.
‘We’ll see you at supper,’ Pop said.
‘Now you must sleep.
Good-bye.
[Pg 38]After he was gone, Pop said: ‘I wouldn’t believe all that about the Aga Khan, you know.
‘It sounded pretty good.
‘Of course he feels badly,’ Pop said.
‘Who wouldn’t.
Von Lettöw was a hell of a man.
‘He’s very intelligent,’ my wife said.
‘He talks wonderfully about the natives.
But he’s bitter about American women.
‘So am I,’ said Pop.
‘He’s a good man.
You better get some shut-eye.
You’ll need to start about three-thirty.
‘Have them call me.
Molo raised the back of the tent, propping it with sticks, so the wind blew through and I went to sleep reading, the wind coming in cool and fresh under the heated canvas.
When I woke it was time to go.
There were rain clouds in the sky and it was very hot.
They had packed some tinned fruit, a five-pound piece of roast meat, bread, tea, a tea pot, and some tinned milk in a whisky box with four bottles of beer.
There was a canvas water bag and a ground cloth to use as a tent.
M’Cola was taking the big gun out to the car.
‘There’s no hurry about getting back,’ Pop said.
‘We’ll look for you when we see you.
‘All right.
‘We’ll send the lorry to haul that sportsman into Handeni.
He’s sending his men ahead walking.
‘You’re sure the lorry can stand it? Don’t do it because he’s a friend of mine.
[Pg 39]‘Have to get him out.
The lorry will be in to-night.
‘The Memsahib’s still asleep,’ I said.
‘Maybe she can get out for a walk and shoot some guineas?’.
‘I’m here,’ she said.
‘Don’t worry about us.
Oh, I hope you get them.
‘Don’t send out to look for us along the road until day after to-morrow,’ I said.
‘If there’s a good chance we’ll stay.
‘Good luck.
‘Good luck, sweet.
Good-bye, Mr.
[Pg 40].
CHAPTER TWO.
We were out from under the shade of camp and along the sandy river of a road, driving into the western sun, the bush thick to the edge of the sand, solid as a thicket, the little hills rising above it, and all along the road we passed groups of people making their way to the westward.
Some were naked except for a greasy cloth knotted over one shoulder, and carried bows and sealed quivers of arrows.
Others carried spears.
The wealthy carried umbrellas and wore draped white cloth and their women walked behind them, with their pots and pans.
Bundles and loads of skins were scattered along ahead on the heads of other natives.
All were travelling[Pg 41] away from the famine.
And in the heat, my feet out over the side of the car to keep them away from the heat of the engine, hat low over the eyes against the sun, watching the road, the people, and all clearings in the bush for game, we drove to the westward.
Once we saw three lesser kudu cows in an open place of broken bush.
Grey, big bellied, long necked, small headed, and with big ears, they moved quickly into the woods and were gone.
We left the car and tracked them but there was no bull track.
A little beyond there a flock of guineas quick-legged across the road running steady-headed with the motion[Pg 42] of trotters.
As I jumped from the car and sprinted after them they rocketed up, their legs tucked close beneath them, heavy-bodied, short wings drumming, cackling, to go over the trees ahead.
I dropped two that thumped hard when they fell and as they lay, wings beating, Abdullah cut their heads off so they would be legal eating.
He put them in the car where M’Cola sat laughing; his old man’s healthy laugh, his making-fun-of-me laugh, his bird-shooting laugh that dated from a streak of raging misses one time that had delighted him.
Now when I killed, it was a joke, as when we shot a hyena; the funniest joke of all.
He laughed always to see the birds tumble and when I missed he roared and shook his head again and again.
‘Ask him what the hell he’s laughing about?’ I asked Pop once.
‘At B’wana,’ M’Cola said, and shook his head, ‘at the little birds.
‘He thinks you’re funny,’ Pop said.
‘Goddam it.
I am funny.
But the hell with him.
‘He thinks you’re very funny,’ Pop said.
‘Now the Memsahib and I would never laugh.
‘Shoot them yourself.
‘No, you’re the bird shot.
The self-confessed bird shot,’ she said.
So bird shooting became this marvellous joke.
If I killed, the joke was on the birds and M’Cola would shake his head and laugh and make his hands go round and round to show how the bird turned over in the air.
And if I missed, I was the clown of the piece and he[Pg 43] would look at me and shake with laughing.
Only the hyenas were funnier.
Highly humorous was the hyena obscenely loping, full belly dragging, at daylight on the plain, who, shot from the stern, skittered on into speed to tumble end over end.
Mirth provoking was the hyena that stopped out of range by an alkali lake to look back and, hit in the chest, went over on his back, his four feet and his full belly in the air.
Nothing could be more jolly than the hyena coming suddenly wedge-headed and stinking out of high grass by a donga, hit at ten yards, who raced his tail in three narrowing, scampering circles until he died.
It was funny to M’Cola to see a hyena shot at close range.
There was that comic slap of the bullet and the hyena’s agitated surprise to find death inside of him.
It was funnier to see a hyena shot at a great distance, in the heat shimmer of the plain, to see him go over backwards, to see him start that frantic circle, to see that electric speed that meant that he was racing the little nickeled death inside him.
But the great joke of all, the thing M’Cola waved his hands across his face about, and turned away and shook his head and laughed, ashamed even of the hyena; the pinnacle of hyenic humour, was the hyena, the classic hyena, that hit too far back while running, would circle madly, snapping and tearing at himself until he pulled his own intestines out, and then stood there, jerking them out and eating them with relish.
‘Fisi,’ M’Cola would say and shake his head in[Pg 44] delighted sorrow at there being such an awful beast.
Fisi, the hyena, hermaphroditic, self-eating devourer of the dead, trailer of calving cows, ham-stringer, potential biter-off of your face at night while you slept, sad yowler, camp-follower, stinking, foul, with jaws that crack the bones the lion leaves, belly dragging, loping away on the brown plain, looking back, mongrel dog-smart in the face; whack from the little Mannlicher and then the horrid circle starting.
‘Fisi,’ M’Cola laughed, ashamed of him, shaking his bald black head.
‘Fisi.
Eats himself.
Fisi.
The hyena was a dirty joke but bird shooting was a clean joke.
My whisky was a clean joke.
There were many variations of that joke.
Some we come to later.
The Mohammedans and all religions were a joke.
A joke on all the people who had them.
Charo, the other gun bearer, was short, very serious and highly religious.
All Ramadan he never swallowed his saliva until sunset and when the sun was almost down I’d see him watching nervously.
He had a bottle with him of some sort of tea and he would finger it and watch the sun and I would see M’Cola watching him and pretending not to see.
This was not outrightly funny to him.
This was something that he could not laugh about openly but that he felt superior to and wondered at the silliness of it.
The Mohammedan religion was very fashionable and all the higher social grades among the boys were Mohammedans.
It was something that gave caste, something to believe in, something fashionable and god-giving to suffer a little for each year, something that made you[Pg 45] superior to other people, something that gave you more complicated habits of eating, something that I understood and M’Cola did not understand, nor care about, and he watched Charo watch for the sun to set with that blank look on his face that it put on about all things that he was not a part of.
Charo was deadly thirsty and truly devout and the sun set very slowly.
I looked at it, red over the trees, nudged him and he grinned.
M’Cola offered me the water bottle solemnly.
I shook my head and Charo grinned again.
M’Cola looked blank.
Then the sun was down and Charo had the bottle tilted up, his Adam’s apple rising and falling greedily and M’Cola looking at him and then looking away.
In the early days, before we became good friends, he did not trust me at all.
When anything came up he went into this blankness.
I liked Charo much better then.
We understood each other on the question of religion and Charo admired my shooting and always shook hands and smiled when we had killed anything particularly good.
This was flattering and pleasing.
M’Cola looked on all this early shooting as a series of lucky accidents.
We were supposed to shoot.
We had not yet shot anything that amounted to anything and he was not really my gun bearer.
He was Mr.
Jackson Phillip’s gun bearer and he had been loaned to me.
I meant nothing to him.
He did not like me nor dislike me.
He was politely contemptuous of Karl.
Who he liked was Mama.
The evening we killed the first lion it was dark when we came in sight of camp.
The killing of the lion had[Pg 46] been confused and unsatisfactory.
It was agreed beforehand that P.
should have the first shot but since it was the first lion any of us had ever shot at, and it was very late in the day, really too late to take the lion on, once he was hit we were to make a dogfight of it and anyone was free to get him.
This was a good plan as it was nearly sundown and if the lion got into cover, wounded, it would be too dark to do anything about it without a mess.
I remember seeing the lion looking yellow and heavy-headed and enormous against a scrubby looking tree in a patch of orchard bush and P.
kneeling to shoot and wanting to tell her to sit down and make sure of him.
Then there was the short-barrelled explosion of the Mannlicher and the lion was going to the left on a run, a strange, heavy-shouldered, foot-swinging, cat run.
I hit him with the Springfield and he went down and spun over and I shot again, too quickly, and threw a cloud of dirt over him.
But there he was, stretched out, on his belly, and, with the sun just over the top of the trees, and the grass very green, we walked up on him like a posse, or a gang of Black and Tans, guns ready and cocked, not knowing whether he was stunned or dead.
When we were close M’Cola threw a stone at him.
It hit him in the flank and from the way it hit you could tell he was a dead animal.
I was sure P.
had hit him but there was only one bullet hole, well back, just below the spine and ranging forward to come to the surface under the skin of the chest.
You could feel the bullet under the skin and M’Cola made a slit and cut it out.
It was a 220-grain solid bullet from[Pg 47] the Springfield and it had raked him, going through lungs and heart.
I was so surprised by the way he had rolled over dead from the shot after we had been prepared for a charge, for heroics, and for drama, that I felt more let down than pleased.
It was our first lion and we were very ignorant and this was not what we had paid to see.
Charo and M’Cola both shook P.
’s hand and then Charo came over and shook hands with me.
‘Good shot, B’wana,’ he said in Swahili.
’Piga m’uzuri.
‘Did you shoot, Karl?’ I asked.
‘No.
I was just going to when you shot.
‘You didn’t shoot him, Pop?’.
‘No.
You’d have heard it.
’ He opened the breech and took out the two big ·450 No.
2’s.
‘I’m sure I missed him,’ P.
said.
‘I was sure you hit him.
I still think you hit him,’ I said.
‘Mama hit,’ M’Cola said.
‘Where?’ Charo asked.
‘Hit,’ said M’Cola.
‘Hit.
‘You rolled him over,’ Pop said to me.
‘God, he went over like a rabbit.
‘I couldn’t believe it.
‘Mama piga,’ M’Cola said.
’Piga Simba.
As we saw the camp fire in the dark ahead of us, coming in that night, M’Cola suddenly commenced to shout a stream of high-pitched, rapid, singing words in Wakamba ending in the word ’Simba‘.
Someone at the camp shouted back one word.
[Pg 48]‘Mama!’ M’Cola shouted.
Then another long stream.
Then ‘Mama! Mama!’.
Through the dark came all the porters, the cook, the skinner, the boys, and the headman.
‘Mama!’ M’Cola shouted.
‘Mama piga Simba.
The boys came dancing, crowing, and beating time and chanting something from down in their chests that started like a cough and sounded like ’Hey la Mama! Hay la Mama! Hey la Mama!‘.
The rolling-eyed skinner picked P.
up, the big cook and the boys held her, and the others pressing forward to lift and if not to lift to touch and hold, they danced and sang through the dark around the fire and to our tent.
‘Hey la Mama! huh! huh! huh! Hay la Mama! huh! huh! huh!’ they sang the lion dance with that deep, lion asthmatic cough in it.
Then at the tent they put her down and everyone, very shyly, shook hands, the boys saying ’m’uzuri, Memsahib,’ and M’Cola and the porters all saying ’m’uzuri, Mama’ with much feeling in the accenting of the word ‘Mama’.
Afterwards in the chairs in front of the fire, sitting with the drinks, Pop said, ‘You shot it.
M’Cola would kill anyone who said you didn’t.
‘You know, I feel as though I did shoot it,’ P.
said.
‘I don’t believe I’d be able to stand it if I really had shot it.
I’d be too proud.
Isn’t triumph marvellous?’.
‘Good old Mama,’ Karl said.
‘I believe you did shoot him,’ I said.
‘Oh, let’s not go into that,’ P.
said.
‘I feel so[Pg 49] wonderful about just being supposed to have killed him.
You know people never used to carry me on their shoulders much at home.
‘No one knows how to behave in America,’ Pop said.
‘Most uncivilized.
‘We’ll carry you in Key West,’ Karl said.
‘Poor old Mama.
‘Let’s not talk about it,’ P.
said.
‘I like it too much.
Shouldn’t I maybe distribute largess?’.
‘They didn’t do it for that,’ Pop said.
‘But it is all right to give something to celebrate.
‘Oh, I want to give them all a great deal of money,’ P.
said.
‘Isn’t triumph simply marvellous?’.
‘Good old Mama,’ I said.
‘You killed him.
‘No, I didn’t.
Don’t lie to me.
Just let me enjoy my triumph.
Anyway M’Cola did not trust me for a long time.
Until P.
’s licence ran out, she was his favourite and we were simply a lot of people who interfered and kept Mama from shooting things.
Once her licence was out and she was no longer shooting, she dropped back into non-combatant status with him and as we began to hunt kudu and Pop stayed in camp and sent us out alone with the trackers, Karl with Charo and M’Cola and I together, M’Cola dropped Pop visibly in his estimation.
It was only temporary of course.
He was Pop’s man and I believe his working estimations were only from day to day and required an unbroken series of events to have any meaning.
But something had happened between us.
[Pg 50].
[Pg 51].
PART II.
PURSUIT REMEMBERED.
[Pg 52].
CHAPTER ONE.
It dated back to the time of Droopy, after I had come back from being ill in Nairobi and we had gone on a foot safari to hunt rhino in the forest.
Droopy was a real savage with lids to his eyes that nearly covered them, handsome, with a great deal of style, a fine hunter and a beautiful tracker.
He was about thirty-five, I should think, and wore only a piece of cloth knotted over one shoulder, and a fez that some hunter had given him.
He always carried a spear.
M’Cola wore an old U.
Army khaki tunic, complete with buttons, that had originally been brought out for Droopy, who had been away somewhere and had missed getting it.
Twice Pop had[Pg 53] brought it out for Droopy and finally M’Cola had said, ‘Give it to me’.
Pop had let him have it and M’Cola had worn it ever since.
It, a pair of shorts, his fuzzy wool curler’s cap, and a knitted army sweater he wore when washing the tunic, were the only garments I ever saw on the old man until he took my bird-shooting coat.
For shoes he used sandals cut from old motor-car tyres.
He had slim, handsome legs with well-turned ankles on the style of Babe Ruth’s and I remember how surprised I was the first time I saw him with the tunic off and noticed how old his upper body was.
It had that aged look you see in[Pg 54] photographs of Jeffries and Sharkey posing thirty years after, the ugly, old-man biceps and the fallen pectoral muscles.
‘How old is M’Cola?’ I asked Pop.
‘He must be over fifty,’ Pop said.
‘He’s got a grown-up family in the native reserve.
‘How are his kids?’.
‘No good, worthless.
He can’t handle them.
We tried one as a porter.
But he was no good.
M’Cola was not jealous of Droopy.
He simply knew that Droopy was a better man than he was.
More of a hunter, a faster and a cleaner tracker, and a great stylist in everything he did.
He admired Droopy in the same way we did and being out with him, it made him realize that he was wearing Droopy’s tunic and that he had been a porter before he became a gun bearer and suddenly he ceased being an old timer and we were hunting together; he and I hunting together and Droopy in command of the show.
That had been a fine hunt.
The afternoon of the day we came into the country we walked about four miles from camp along a deep rhino trail that graded through the grassy hills with their abandoned orchard-looking trees, as smoothly and evenly as though an engineer had planned it.
The trail was a foot deep in the ground and smoothly worn and we left it where it slanted down through a divide in the hills like a dry irrigation ditch and climbed, sweating, the small, steep hill on the right to sit there with our backs against the hilltop and glass the country.
It was a green, pleasant country, with hills[Pg 55] below the forest that grew thick on the side of a mountain, and it was cut by the valleys of several watercourses that came down out of the thick timber on the mountain.
Fingers of the forest came down on to the head of some of the slopes and it was there, at the forest edge, that we watched for rhino to come out.
If you looked away from the forest and the mountain side you could follow the watercourses and the hilly slope of the land down until the land flattened and the grass was brown and burned and, away, across a long sweep of country, was the brown Rift Valley and the shine of Lake Manyara.
We all lay there on the hillside and watched the country carefully for rhino.
Droopy was on the other side of the hilltop, squatted on his heels, looking, and M’Cola sat below us.
There was a cool breeze from the east and it blew the grass in waves on the hillsides.
There were many large white clouds and the tall trees of the forest on the mountain side grew so closely and were so foliaged that it looked as though you could walk on their tops.
Behind this mountain there was a gap and then another mountain and the far mountain was dark blue with forest in the distance.
Until five o’clock we did not see anything.
Then, without the glasses, I saw something moving over the shoulder of one of the valleys toward a strip of the timber.
In the glasses it was a rhino, showing very clear and minute at the distance, red-coloured in the sun, moving with a quick waterbug-like motion across the hill.
Then there were three more of them that came out of the forest,[Pg 56] dark in the shadow, and two that fought, tinily, in the glasses, pushing head-on, fighting in front of a clump of bushes while we watched them and the light failed.
It was too dark to get down the hill, across the valley and up the narrow slope of mountain side to them in time for a shot.
So we went back to the camp, down the hill in the dark, edging down on our shoes and then feeling the trail smooth under foot, walking along that deep trail, that wound through the dark hills, until we saw the firelight in the trees.
We were excited that night because we had seen the three rhino and early the next morning while we were eating breakfast before starting out, Droopy came in to report a herd of buffalo he had found feeding at the edge of the forest not two miles from camp.
We went there, still tasting coffee and kippers in the early morning heart-pounding of excitement, and the native Droopy had left watching them pointed where they had crossed a deep gulch and gone into an open patch of forest.
He said there were two big bulls in a herd of a dozen or more.
We followed them in, moving very quietly on the game trails, pushing the vines aside and seeing the tracks and the quantities of fresh dung, but though we went on into the forest, where it was too thick to shoot and made a wide circle, we did not see or hear them.
Once we heard the tick birds and saw them flying, but that was all.
There were numbers of rhino trails there in the woods and many strawy piles of dung, but we saw nothing but the green wood-pigeons and some monkeys, and when we came out we were wet to our waists[Pg 57] from the dew, and the sun was quite high.
The day was very hot, now before the wind had gotten up, and we knew whatever rhino and buffalo had been out would have gone back deep into the forest to rest out of the heat.
The others started back to camp with Pop and M’Cola.
There was no meat in camp, and I wanted to hunt back in a circle with Droopy to see if we could kill a piece.
I was beginning to feel strong again after the dysentery and it was a pleasure to walk in the easy rolling country, simply to walk, and to be able to hunt, not knowing what we might see and free to shoot for the meat we needed.
Then, too, I liked Droopy and liked to watch him walk.
He strode very loosely and with a slight lift, and I liked to watch him and to feel the grass under my soft-soled boots and the pleasant weight of the rifle, held just back of the muzzle, the barrel resting on my shoulder, and the sun hot enough to sweat you well as it burned the dew from the grass; with the breeze starting and the country like an abandoned New England orchard to walk through.
I knew that I was shooting well again and I wanted to make a shot to impress Droopy.
From the top of one rise we saw two kongoni showing yellow on a hillside about a mile away and I motioned to Droop that we would go after them.
We started down and in a ravine jumped a waterbuck bull and two cows.
Waterbuck was the one animal we might get that I knew was worthless as meat and I had shot a better head than this one carried.
I had the sights on the buck as he tore[Pg 58] away, remembered about the worthless meat, and having the head, and did not shoot.
‘No shoot kuro?’ Droopy asked in Swahili.
’Doumi sana.
A good bull.
I tried to tell him that I had a better one and that it was no good to eat.
He grinned.
‘Piga kongoni m’uzuri.
‘Piga’ was a fine word.
It sounded exactly as the command to fire should sound or the announcement of a hit.
‘M’uzuri’, meaning good, well, better, had sounded too much like the name of a state for a long time, and walking I used to make up sentences in Swahili with Arkansas and M’usuri in them, but now it seemed natural, no longer to be italicized, just as all the words came to seem the proper and natural words and there was nothing odd or unseemly in the stretching of the ears, in the tribal scars, or in a man carrying a spear.
The tribal marks and the tattooed places seemed natural and handsome adornments and I regretted not having any of my own.
My own scars were all informal, some irregular and sprawling, others simply puffy welts.
I had one on my forehead that people still commented on, asking if I had bumped my head; but Droop had handsome ones beside his cheekbones and others, symmetrical and decorative, on his chest and belly.
I was thinking that I had one good one, a sort of embossed Christmas tree, on the bottom of my right foot that only served to wear out socks, when we jumped two reedbuck.
They went off through the trees and then stood at sixty yards, the thin,[Pg 59] graceful buck looking back, and I shot him high and a touch behind the shoulder.
He gave a jump and went off very fast.
‘Piga.
’ Droopy smiled.
We had both heard the whunk of the bullet.
‘Kufa,’ I told him.
‘Dead.
But when we came up to him, lying on his side, his heart was still beating strongly, although to all appearances he was dead.
Droopy had no skinning knife and I had only a penknife to stick him with.
I felt for the heart behind the foreleg with my fingers and feeling it beating under the hide slipped the knife in but it was short and pushed the heart away.
I could feel it, hot and rubbery against my fingers, and feel the knife push it, but I felt around and cut the big artery and the blood came hot against my fingers.
Once bled, I started to open him, with the little knife, still showing off to Droopy, and emptying him neatly took out the liver, cut away the gall, and laying the liver on a hummock of grass, put the kidneys beside it.
Droopy asked for the knife.
Now he was going to show me something.
Skilfully he slit open the stomach and turned it inside, tripe side, out, emptying the grass in it on the ground, shook it, then put the liver and kidneys inside it and with the knife cut a switch from the tree the buck lay under and sewed the stomach together with the withe so that the tripe made a bag to carry the other delicacies in.
Then he cut a pole and put the bag on the end of it, running it through the flaps, and put it over his shoulder in the way tramps carried[Pg 60] their property in a handkerchief on the end of a stick in Blue Jay corn plaster advertisements when we were children.
It was a good trick and I thought how I would show it to John Staib in Wyoming some time and he would smile his deaf man’s smile (you had to throw pebbles at him to make him stop when you heard a bull bugle), and I knew what John would say.
He would say, ‘By Godd, Urnust, dot’s smardt’.
Droop handed me the stick, then took off his single garment, made a sling and got the buck up on his back.
I tried to help him and suggested by signs that we cut a pole and sling him, carrying him between us, but he wanted to carry him alone.
So we started for camp, me with the tripe bag on the end of a stick over my shoulder, my rifle slung, and Droopy staggering steadily ahead, sweating heavily, under the buck.
I tried to get him to hang him in a tree and leave him until we could send out a couple of porters, and to that end we put him in the crotch of a tree.
But when Droopy saw that I meant to go off and leave him there rather than simply allow him to drain he got him down on to his shoulders again and we went on into camp, the boys, around the cooking fire, all laughing at the tripe bag over my shoulder as we came in.
This was the kind of hunting that I liked.
No riding in cars, the country broken up instead of the plains, and I was completely happy.
I had been quite ill and had that pleasant feeling of getting stronger each day.
I was underweight, had a great appetite for meat, and could eat all I wanted without feeling stuffy.
Each day I[Pg 61] sweated out whatever we drank sitting at the fire at night, and in the heat of the day, now, I lay in the shade with a breeze in the trees and read with no obligation and no compulsion to write, happy in knowing that at four o’clock we would be starting out to hunt again.
I would not even write a letter.
The only person I really cared about, except the children, was with me, and I had no wish to share this life with anyone who was not there, only to live it, being completely happy and quite tired.
I knew that I was shooting well and I had that feeling of well-being and confidence that is so much more pleasant to have than to hear about.
As it turned out, we started soon after three to be on the hill by four.
But it was nearly five before we saw the first rhino come bustling short-leggedly across the ridge of hill in almost the same place we had seen the rhino the night before.
We sat where he went into the edge of the forest near where we had seen the two fighting and then took a course that would lead us down the hill, across the grown-over gully at the bottom, and up the steep slope to where there was a thorn tree with yellow blossoms that marked the place where we had seen the rhino go in.
Coming straight up the slope in sight of the thorn tree, the wind blowing across the hill, I tried to walk as slowly as I could and put a handkerchief inside the sweatband of my hat to keep the perspiration out of my glasses.
I expected to shoot at any minute and I wanted to slow up enough so my heart would not be pounding.
In shooting large animals there is no reason ever to miss[Pg 62] if you have a clear shot and can shoot and know where to shoot, unless you are unsteady from a run or a climb or fog your glasses, break them or run out of cloth or paper to wipe them clean.
The glasses were the biggest hazard and I used to carry four handkerchiefs and change them from the left to the right pocket when they were wet.
We came up to the yellow blossomed tree very carefully, like people walking up to a bevy of quail the dogs have pointed, and the rhino was not in sight.
We went all through the edge of the forest and it was full of tracks and fresh rhino sign, but there was no rhino.
The sun was setting and it was getting too dark to shoot, but we followed the forest around the side of the mountain, hoping to see a rhino in the open glades.
When it was almost too dark to shoot, I saw Droopy stop and crouch.
With his head down he motioned us forward.
Crawling up, we saw a large rhino and a small one standing chest deep in brush, facing us across a little valley.
‘Cow and calf,’ Pop said softly.
‘Can’t shoot her.
Let me look at her horn.
’ He took the glasses from M’Cola.
‘Can she see us?’ P.
asked.
‘No.
‘How far are they?’.
‘Must be nearly five hundred yards.
‘My God, she looks big,’ I whispered.
‘She’s a big cow,’ Pop said.
‘Wonder what became of the bull?’ He was pleased and excited by the sight of game.
‘Too dark to shoot unless we’re right on him.
[Pg 63]The rhinos had turned and were feeding.
They never seemed to move slowly.
They either bustled or stood still.
‘What makes them so red?’ P.
asked.
‘Rolling in the mud,’ Pop answered.
‘We better get along while there’s light.
The sun was down when we came out of the forest and looked down the slope and across to the hill where we had watched from with our glasses.
We should have back-tracked and gone down, crossed the gulch, and climbed back up the trail the way we had come, but we decided, like fools, to grade straight across the mountainside below the edge of the forest.
So in the dark, following this ideal line, we descended into steep ravines that showed only as wooded patches until you were in them, slid down, clung to vines, stumbled and climbed and slid again, down and down, then steeply, impossibly, up, hearing the rustle of night things and the cough of a leopard hunting baboons; me scared of snakes, and touching each root and branch with snake fear in the dark.
To go down and up two hands-and-knee climbing ravines and then out into the moonlight and the long, too-steep shoulder of mountain that you climbed one foot up to the other, one foot after the other, one stride at a time, leaning forward against the grade and the altitude, dead tired and gun weary, single file in the moonlight across the slope, on up and to the top where it was easy, the country spread in the moonlight, then up and down and on, through the small hills, tired but now in sight of the fires and on into camp.
[Pg 64]So then you sit, bundled against the evening chill, at the fire, with a whisky and soda, waiting for the announcement that the canvas bath had been a quarter filled with hot water.
‘Bathi, B’wana.
‘Goddamn it, I could never hunt sheep again,’ you say.
‘I never could,’ says P.
‘You all made me.
‘You climbed better than any of us.
‘Do you suppose we could hunt sheep again, Pop?’.
‘I wonder,’ Pop said.
‘I suppose it’s merely condition.
‘It’s riding in the damned cars that ruins us.
‘If we did that walk every night we could come back in three nights from now and never feel it.
‘Yes.
But I’d be as scared of snakes if we did it every night for a year.
‘You’d get over it.
‘No,’ I said.
‘They scare me stiff.
Do you remember that time we touched hands behind the tree?’.
‘Rather,’ said Pop.
‘You jumped two yards.
Are you really afraid of them, or only talking?’.
‘They scare me sick,’ I said.
‘They always have.
‘What’s the matter with you men?’ P.
said.
‘Why haven’t I heard anything about the war to-night?’.
‘We’re too tired.
Were you in the war, Pop?’.
‘Not me,’ said Pop.
‘Where is that boy with the whisky?’ Then calling in that feeble, clowning falsetto, ‘Kayti.
Katy-ay!’.
‘Bathi,’ said Molo again softly, but insistently.
[Pg 65]‘Too tired.
‘Memsahib bathi,’ Molo said hopefully.
‘I’ll go,’ said P.
‘But you two hurry up with your drinking.
I’m hungry.
‘Bathi,’ said Kayti severely to Pop.
‘Bathi yourself,’ said Pop.
‘Don’t bully me.
Kayti turned away in fire-lit slanting smile.
‘All right.
All right,’ said Pop.
‘Going to have one?’ he asked.
‘We’ll have just one,’ I said, ‘and then we’ll bathi.
‘Bathi, B’wana M’Kumba,’ Molo said.
came toward the fire wearing her blue dressing-gown and mosquito boots.
‘Go on,’ she said.
‘You can have another when you come out.
There’s nice, warm, muddy water.
‘They bully us,’ Pop said.
‘Do you remember the time we were sheep hunting and your hat blew off and nearly fell on to the ram?’ I asked her, the whisky racing my mind back to Wyoming.
‘Go take your bathi,’ P.
said.
‘I’m going to have a gimlet.
In the morning we were dressed before daylight, ate breakfast, and were hunting the forest edge and the sunken valleys where Droop had seen the buffalo before the sun was up.
But they were not there.
It was a long hunt and we came back to camp and decided to send the lorries for porters and move with a foot safari to where there was supposed to be water in a stream that came down out of the mountain beyond where we had seen the rhinos the night before.
Being camped there we[Pg 66] could hunt a new country along the forest edge and we would be much closer to the mountain.
The trucks were to bring in Karl from his kudu camp where he seemed to be getting disgusted, or discouraged, or both, and he could go down to the Rift Valley the next day and kill some meat and try for an oryx.
If we found good rhino we would send for him.
We did not want to fire any shots where we were going except at rhino in order not to scare them, and we needed meat.
The rhino seemed very shy and I knew from Wyoming how the shy game will all shift out of a small country, a country being an area, a valley or range of hills, a man can hunt in, after a shot or two.
We planned this all out, Pop consulting with Droopy, and then sent the lorries off with Dan to recruit porters.
Late in the afternoon they were back with Karl, his outfit, and forty M’Bulus, good-looking savages with a pompous headman who wore the only pair of shorts among them.
Karl was thin now, his skin sallow, his eyes very tired looking and he seemed a little desperate.
He had been eight days in the kudu camp in the hills, hunting hard, with no one with him who spoke any English, and they had only seen two cows and jumped a bull out of range.
The guides claimed they had seen another bull but Karl had thought it was kongoni, or that they said it was a kongoni, and had not shot.
He was bitter about this and it was not a happy outfit.
‘I never saw his horns.
I don’t believe it was a bull,’ he said.
Kudu hunting was a touchy subject with him now and we let it alone.
[Pg 67]‘He’ll get an oryx down there and he’ll feel better,’ Pop said.
‘It’s gotten on his nerves a little.
Karl agreed to the plan for us to move ahead into the new country, and for him to go down for meat.
‘Whatever you say,’ he said.
‘Absolutely whatever you say.
‘It will give him some shooting,’ Pop said.
‘Then he’ll feel better.
‘We’ll get one.
Then you get one.
Whoever gets his first can go on down after oryx.
You’ll probably get an oryx to-morrow anyway when you’re hunting meat.
‘Whatever you say,’ Karl said.
His mind was bitterly revolving eight blank days of hill climbing in the heat, out before daybreak, back at dark, hunting an animal whose Swahili name he could not then remember, with trackers in whom he had no confidence, coming back to eat alone, no one to whom he could talk, his wife nine thousand miles and three months away, and how was his dog and how was his job, and god-damn it where were they and what if he missed one when he got a shot, he wouldn’t, you never missed when it was really important, he was sure of that, that was one of the tenets of his faith, but what if he got excited and missed, and why didn’t he get any letters, what did the guide say kongoni for that time, they did, he knew they did, but he said nothing of all that, only, ‘Whatever you say’, a little desperately.
‘Come on, cheer up, you bastard,’ I said.
‘I’m cheerful.
What’s the matter with you?’.
‘Have a drink.
[Pg 68]‘I don’t want a drink.
I want a kudu.
Later Pop said, ‘I thought he’d do well off by himself with no one to hurry him or rattle him.
He’ll be all right.
He’s a good lad.
‘He wants someone to tell him exactly what to do and still leave him alone and not rattle him,’ I said.
‘It’s hell for him to shoot in front of everybody.
He’s not a damned show-off like me.
‘He made a damned fine shot at that leopard,’ Pop said.
‘Two of them,’ I said.
‘The second was as good as the first.
Hell, he can shoot.
On the range he’ll shoot the pants off of any of us.
But he worries about it and I rattle him trying to get him to speed up.
‘You’re a little hard on him sometimes,’ Pop said.
‘Hell, he knows me.
He knows what I think of him.
He doesn’t mind.
‘I still think he’ll find himself off by himself,’ Pop said.
‘It’s just a question of confidence.
He’s really a good shot.
‘He’s got the best buff, the best waterbuck, and the best lion, now,’ I said.
‘He’s got nothing to worry about.
‘The Memsahib has the best lion, brother.
Don’t make any mistake about that.
‘I’m glad of that.
But he’s got a damned fine lion and a big leopard.
Everything he has is good.
We’ve got plenty of time.
He’s got nothing to worry about.
What the hell is he so gloomy about?’.
‘We’ll get an early start in the morning so we can[Pg 69] finish it off before it gets too hot for the little Memsahib.
‘She’s in the best shape of any one.
‘She’s marvellous.
She’s like a little terrier.
We went out that afternoon and glassed the country from the hills and never saw a thing.
That night after supper we were in the tent.
disliked intensely being compared to a little terrier.
If she must be like any dog, and she did not wish to be, she would prefer a wolfhound, something lean, racy, long-legged and ornamental.
Her courage was so automatic and so much a simple state of being that she never thought of danger; then, too, danger was in the hands of Pop and for Pop she had a complete, clear-seeing, absolutely trusting adoration.
Pop was her ideal of how a man should be, brave, gentle, comic, never losing his temper, never bragging, never complaining except in a joke, tolerant, understanding, intelligent, drinking a little too much as a good man should, and, to her eyes, very handsome.
‘Don’t you think Pop’s handsome?’.
‘No,’ I said.
‘Droopy’s handsome.
‘Droopy’s beautiful.
But don’t you really think Pop’s handsome?’.
‘Hell, no.
I like him as well as any man I’ve ever known, but I’m damned if he’s handsome.
‘I think he’s lovely looking.
But you understand about how I feel about him, don’t you?’.
‘Sure.
I’m as fond of the bastard myself.
‘But don’t you think he’s handsome, really?’.
‘Nope.
[Pg 70]Then, a little later:.
‘Well, who’s handsome to you?’.
‘Belmonte and Pop.
And you.
‘Don’t be patriotic,’ I said.
‘Who’s a beautiful woman?’.
‘Garbo.
‘Not any more.
Josie is.
Margot is.
‘Yes, they are.
I know I’m not.
‘You’re lovely.
‘Let’s talk about Mr.
I don’t like you to call him Pop.
It’s not dignified.
‘He and I aren’t dignified together.
‘Yes, but I’m dignified with him.
Don’t you think he’s wonderful?’.
‘Yes, and he doesn’t have to read books written by some female he’s tried to help get published saying how he’s yellow.
‘She’s just jealous and malicious.
You never should have helped her.
Some people never forgive that.
‘It’s a shame, though, with all that talent gone to malice and nonsense and self-praise.
It’s a goddamned shame, really.
It’s a shame you never knew her before she went to pot.
You know a funny thing; she never could write dialogue.
It was terrible.
She learned how to do it from my stuff and used it in that book.
She had never written like that before.
She never could forgive learning that and she was afraid people would notice it, where she’d learned it, so she had to attack me.
It’s a funny racket, really.
But I swear she was nice before she got ambitious.
You would have liked her then, really.
[Pg 71]‘Maybe, but I don’t think so,’ said P.
‘We have fun though, don’t we? Without all those people.
‘God damn it if we don’t.
I’ve had a better time every year since I can remember.
‘But isn’t Mr.
wonderful? Really?’.
‘Yes.
He’s wonderful.
‘Oh, you’re nice to say it.
Poor Karl.
‘Why?’.
‘Without his wife.
‘Yes,’ I said.
‘Poor Karl.
[Pg 72].
CHAPTER TWO.
So in the morning, again, we started ahead of the porters and went down and across the hills and through a deeply forested valley and then up and across a long rise of country with high grass that made the walking difficult, and on and up and across, resting sometimes in the shade of a tree, and then on and up and down and across, all in high grass now, that you had to break a trail in, and the sun was very hot.
The five of us in single file, Droop and M’Cola with a big gun apiece, hung with musettes and water bottles and the cameras, we all sweating in the sun, Pop and I with guns and the Memsahib trying to walk like Droopy, her Stetson tilted on one side, happy to be on a[Pg 73] trip, pleased about how comfortable her boots were, we came finally to a thicket of thorn trees over a ravine that ran down from the side of a ridge to the water and we leaned the guns against the trees and went in under the close shade and lay on the ground.
got the books out of one of the musettes and she and Pop read while I followed the ravine down to the little stream that came out of the mountainside, and found a fresh lion track and many rhino tunnels in the tall grass that came higher than your head.
It was very hot climbing back up the sandy ravine and I was glad to lean my back against the tree trunk and read in Tolstoy’s Sevastopol.
It was a[Pg 74] very young book and had one fine description of fighting in it, where the French take the redoubt, and I thought about Tolstoy and about what a great advantage an experience of war was to a writer.
It was one of the major subjects and certainly one of the hardest to write truly of, and those writers who had not seen it were always very jealous and tried to make it seem unimportant, or abnormal, or a disease as a subject, while, really, it was just something quite irreplaceable that they had missed.
Then Sevastopol made me think of the Boulevard Sevastopol in Paris, about riding a bicycle down it in the rain on the way home from Strassburg and the slipperiness of the rails of the tram cars and the feeling of riding on greasy, slippery asphalt and cobble stones in traffic in the rain, and how we had nearly lived on the Boulevard du Temple that time, and I remembered the look of that apartment, how it was arranged, and the wall paper, and instead we had taken the upstairs of the pavilion in Notre Dame des Champs in the courtyard with the sawmill (and the sudden whine of the saw, the smell of sawdust and the chestnut tree over the roof with a mad woman downstairs), and the year worrying about money (all of the stories back in the post that came in through a slit in the saw-mill door, with notes of rejection that would never call them stories, but always anecdotes, sketches, contes, etc.
They did not want them, and we lived on poireaux and drank cahors and water), and how fine the fountains were at the Place de L’Observatoire (water sheen rippling on the bronze of horses’ manes, bronze breasts and shoulders, green under thin-flowing[Pg 75] water), and when they put up the bust of Flaubert in the Luxembourg on the short cut through the gardens on the way to the rue Soufflot (one that we believed in, loved without criticism, heavy now in stone as an idol should be).
He had not seen war but he had seen a revolution and the Commune, and a revolution is much the best if you do not become bigoted because every one speaks the same language.
Just as civil war is the best war for a writer, the most complete.
Stendhal had seen a war and Napoleon taught him to write.
He was teaching everybody then; but no one else learned.
Dostoevski was made by being sent to Siberia.
Writers are forged in injustice as a sword is forged.
I wondered if it would make a writer of him, give him the necessary shock to cut the over-flow of words and give him a sense of proportion, if they sent Tom Wolfe to Siberia or to the Dry Tortugas.
Maybe it would and maybe it wouldn’t.
He seemed sad, really, like Carnera.
Tolstoy was a small man.
Joyce was of medium height and he wore his eyes out.
And that last night, drunk, with Joyce and the thing he kept quoting from Edgar Quinet, ‘Fraîche et rose comme au jour de la bataille’.
I didn’t have it right I knew.
And when you saw him he would take up a conversation interrupted three years before.
It was nice to see a great writer in our time.
What I had to do was work.
I did not care, particularly, how it all came out.
I did not take my own life seriously any more, any one else’s life, yes, but not mine.
They all wanted something that I did not want and I would get it without wanting it, if I worked.
To work was the only[Pg 76] thing, it was the one thing that always made you feel good, and in the meantime it was my own damned life and I would lead it where and how I pleased.
And where I had led it now pleased me very much.
This was a better sky than Italy.
The hell it was.
The best sky was in Italy and Spain and Northern Michigan in the fall and in the fall in the Gulf off Cuba.
You could beat this sky; but not the country.
All I wanted to do now was get back to Africa.
We had not left it, yet, but when I would wake in the night I would lie, listening, homesick for it already.
Now, looking out the tunnel of trees over the ravine at the sky with white clouds moving across in the wind, I loved the country so that I was happy as you are after you have been with a woman that you really love, when, empty, you feel it welling up again and there it is and you can never have it all and yet what there is, now, you can have, and you want more and more, to have, and be, and live in, to possess now again for always, for that long, sudden-ended always; making time stand still, sometimes so very still that afterwards you wait to hear it move, and it is slow in starting.
But you are not alone, because if you have ever really loved her happy and untragic, she loves you always; no matter whom she loves nor where she goes she loves you more.
So if you have loved some woman and some country you are very fortunate and, if you die afterwards, it makes no difference.
Now, being in Africa, I was hungry for more of it, the changes of the seasons, the rains with no need to travel, the discomforts that you paid to make it real, the names of the trees, of[Pg 77] the small animals, and all the birds, to know the language and have time to be in it and to move slowly.
I have loved country all my life; the country was always better than the people.
I could only care about people a very few at a time.
was sleeping.
She was always lovely to look at asleep, sleeping quietly, close curled like an animal, with nothing of the being dead look that Karl had asleep.
Pop slept quietly too, you could see his soul was close in his body.
His body no longer housed him fittingly.
It had gone on and changed, thickening here, losing its lines, bloating a little there, but inside he was young and lean and tall and hard as when he galloped lion on the plain below Wami, and the pouches under his eyes were all outside, so that now I saw him asleep the way P.
saw him always.
M’Cola was an old man asleep, without history and without mystery.
Droopy did not sleep.
He sat on his heels and watched for the safari.
We saw them coming a long way off.
At first the boxes just showed above the high grass, then a line of heads, then they were in a hollow, and there was only the point of a spear in the sun, then they came up a rise of ground and I could see the strung out line coming towards us.
They had gone a little too far to the left and Droopy waved to signal them toward us.
They made camp, Pop warning them to be quiet, and we sat under the dining tent and were comfortable in the chairs and talked.
That night we hunted and saw nothing.
The next morning we hunted and saw nothing and the next evening the same.
It was very interesting but there were no results.
The[Pg 78] wind blew hard from the east and the ground was broken in short ridges of hills coming down close from the forest so you could not get above it without sending your scent on ahead of you on the wind to warn everything.
You could not see into the sun in the evening, nor on the heavy shadowed hillsides to the west, beyond which the sun was setting at the time the rhino would be coming out of the forest; so all the country to the westward was a loss in the evening and in the country we could hunt we found nothing.
Meat came in from Karl’s camp by some porters we sent back.
They came in carrying quarters of tommy, grant, and wildebeeste, dusty, the meat seared dry by the sun, and the porters were happy, crouched around their fires roasting the meat on sticks.
Pop was puzzled why the rhino were all gone.
Each day we had seen less and we discussed whether it could be the full moon, that they fed out at night and were back in the forest in the morning before it was light, or that they winded us, or heard the men, and were simply shy and kept in the forest, or what was it? Me putting out the theories, Pop pricking them with his wit, sometimes considering them from politeness, sometimes with interest, like the one about the moon.
We went to bed early and in the night it rained a little, not a real rain but a shower from the mountains, and in the morning we were up before daylight and had climbed up to the top of the steep grassy ridge that looked down on to the camp, on to the ravine of the river bed, and across to the steep opposite bank of the stream, and from where we could see all the hilly slopes and the edge[Pg 79] of the forest.
It was not yet light when some geese flew overhead and the light was still too grey to be able to see the edge of the forest clearly in the glasses.
We had scouts out on three different hill tops and we were waiting for it to be light enough for us to see them if they signalled.
Then Pop said, ‘Look at that son of a bitch’, and shouted at M’Cola to bring the rifles.
M’Cola went jumping down the hill, and across the stream, directly opposite us, a rhino was running with a quick trot along the top of the bank.
As we watched he speeded up and came, fast trotting, angling down across the face of the bank.
He was a muddy red, his horn showed clearly, and there was nothing ponderous in his quick, purposeful movement.
I was very excited at seeing him.
‘He’ll cross the stream,’ Pop said.
‘He’s shootable.
M’Cola put the Springfield in my hand and I opened it to make sure I had solids.
The Rhino was out of sight now but I could see the shaking of the high grass.
‘How far would you call it?’.
‘All of three hundred.
‘I’ll bust the son of a bitch.
I was watching, freezing myself deliberately inside, stopping the excitement as you close a valve, going into that impersonal state you shoot from.
He showed, trotting into the shallow, boulder-filled stream.
Thinking of one thing, that the shot was perfectly possible, but that I must lead him enough, must get ahead, I got on him, then well ahead of him, and squeezed off.
I heard the whonk of the bullet and, from[Pg 80] his trot, he seemed to explode forward.
With a whooshing snort he smashed ahead, splashing water and snorting.
I shot again and raised a little column of water behind him, and shot again as he went into the grass; behind him again.
‘Piga,’ M’Cola said.
‘Piga!’.
Droopy agreed.
‘Did you hit him?’ Pop said.
‘Absolutely,’ I said.
‘I think I’ve got him.
Droopy was running and I re-loaded and ran off after him.
Half the camp was strung out across the hills waving and yelling.
The rhino had come in right below where they were and gone on up the valley towards where the forest came close down into the head of the valley.
Pop and P.
came up.
Pop with his big gun and M’Cola carrying mine.
‘Droopy will get the tracks,’ Pop said.
‘M’Cola swears you hit him.
‘Piga!’ M’Cola said.
‘He snorted like a steam engine,’ P.
said.
‘Didn’t he look wonderful going along there?’.
‘He was late getting home with the milk,’ Pop said.
‘Are you sure you hit him? It was a godawful long shot.
‘I know I hit him.
I’m pretty sure I’ve killed him.
‘Don’t tell any one if you did,’ Pop said.
‘They’ll never believe you.
Look! Droopy’s got blood.
Below, in the high grass, Droop was holding up a grass blade towards us.
Then, stooped, he went on trailing fast by the blood spoor.
‘Piga,’ M’Cola said.
‘M’uzuri!’.
[Pg 81]‘We’ll keep up above where we can see if he makes a break,’ Pop said.
‘Look at Droopy.
Droop had removed his fez and held it in his hand.
‘That’s all the precautions he needs,’ Pop said.
‘We bring up a couple of heavy guns and Droopy goes in after him with one article less of clothing.
Below us Droopy and his partner who was trailing with him had stopped.
Droopy held up his hand.
‘They hear him,’ Pop said.
‘Come on.
We started toward them.
Droopy came toward us and spoke to Pop.
‘He’s in there,’ Pop whispered.
‘They can hear the tick birds.
One of the boys says he heard the faro, too.
We’ll go in against the wind.
You go ahead with Droopy.
Let the Memsahib stay behind me.
Take the big gun.
All right.
The rhino was in high grass, somewhere in there behind some bushes.
As we went forward we heard a deep, moaning sort of groan.
Droopy looked around at me and grinned.
The noise came again, ending this time like a blood-choked sigh.
Droopy was laughing.
‘Faro,’ he whispered and put his hand palm open on the side of his head in the gesture that means to go to sleep.
Then in a jerky-flighted, sharp-beaked little flock we saw the tick birds rise and fly away.
We knew where he was and, as we went slowly forward, parting the high grass, we saw him.
He was on his side, dead.
‘Better shoot him once to make sure,’ Pop said.
M’Cola handed me the Springfield he had been carrying.
I noticed it was cocked, looked at M’Cola, furious with[Pg 82] him, kneeled down and shot the rhino in the sticking place.
He never moved.
Droopy shook my hand and so did M’Cola.
‘He had that damned Springfield cocked,’ I said to Pop.
The cocked gun, behind my back, made me black angry.
That meant nothing to M’Cola.
He was very happy, stroking the rhino’s horn, measuring it with his fingers spread, looking for the bullet hole.
‘It’s on the side he’s lying on,’ I said.
‘You should have seen him when he was protecting Mama,’ Pop said.
‘That’s why he had the gun cocked.
‘Can he shoot?’.
‘No,’ Pop said.
‘But he would.
‘Shoot me in the pants,’ I said.
‘Romantic bastard.
’ When the whole outfit came up, we rolled the rhino into a sort of kneeling position and cut away the grass to take some pictures.
The bullet hole was fairly high in the back, a little behind the lungs.
‘That was a hell of a shot,’ Pop said.
‘A hell of a shot.
Don’t ever tell any one you made that one.
‘You’ll have to give me a certificate.
‘That would just make us both liars.
They’re a strange beast, aren’t they?’.
There he was, long-hulked, heavy-sided, prehistoric looking, the hide like vulcanized rubber and faintly transparent looking, scarred with a badly healed horn wound that the birds had pecked at, his tail thick, round, and pointed, flat many-legged ticks crawling on him, his ears fringed with hair, tiny pig eyes, moss growing on[Pg 83] the base of his horn that grew out forward from his nose.
M’Cola looked at him and shook his head.
I agreed with him.
This was the hell of an animal.
‘How is his horn?’.
‘It isn’t bad,’ Pop said.
‘It’s nothing extra.
That was a hell of a shot you made on him though, brother.
‘M’Cola’s pleased with it,’ I said.
‘You’re pretty pleased with it yourself,’ P.
said.
‘I’m crazy about it,’ I said.
‘But don’t let me start on it.
Don’t worry about how I feel about it.
I can wake up and think about that any night.
‘And you’re a good tracker, and a hell of a fine bird shot, too,’ Pop said.
‘Tell us the rest of that.
‘Lay off me.
I only said that once when I was drunk.
‘Once,’ said P.
‘Doesn’t he tell us that every night?’.
‘By God, I am a good bird shot.
‘Amazing,’ said Pop.
‘I never would have thought it.
What else is it you do?’.
‘Oh, go to hell.
‘Mustn’t ever let him realize what a shot that was or he’ll get unbearable,’ Pop said to P.
‘M’Cola and I know,’ I said.
M’Cola came up.
‘M’uzuri, B’wana,’ he said.
‘M’uzuri sana.
‘He thinks you did it on purpose,’ Pop said.
‘Don’t you ever tell him different.
‘Piga m’uzuri,’ M’Cola said.
‘M’uzuri.
‘I believe he feels just the way you do about it,’ Pop said.
[Pg 84]‘He’s my pal.
‘I believe he is, you know,’ Pop said.
On our way back across country to our main camp I made a fancy shot on a reedbuck at about two hundred yards, offhand, breaking his neck at the base of the skull.
M’Cola was very pleased and Droopy was delighted.
‘We’ve got to put a stop to him,’ Pop said to P.
‘Where did you shoot for, really?’.
‘In the neck,’ I lied.
I had held full on the centre of the shoulder.
‘It was awfully pretty,’ P.
said.
The bullet had made a crack when it hit like a bat swung against a fast ball and the buck had collapsed without a move.
‘I think he’s a damned liar,’ Pop said.
‘None of us great shots is appreciated.
Wait till we’re gone.
‘His idea of being appreciated is for us to carry him on our shoulders,’ Pop said.
‘That rhino shot has ruined him.
‘All right.
You watch from now on.
Hell, I’ve shot well the whole time.
‘I seem to remember a grant of some sort,’ Pop was teasing.
So did I remember him.
I’d followed a fine one out of the country missing shot after shot all morning after a series of stalks in the heat, then crawled up to an ant hill to shoot one that was not nearly as good, taken a rest on the ant hill, missed the buck at fifty yards, seen him stand facing me, absolutely still, his nose up, and shot him in the chest.
He went over backwards and as I went up to him he jumped up and went off, staggering.
[Pg 85] I sat down and waited for him to stop and when he did, obviously anchored, I sat there, using the sling, and shot for his neck, slowly and carefully, missing him eight times straight in a mounting, stubborn rage, not making a correction but shooting exactly for the same place in the same way each time, the gun bearers all laughing, the truck that had come up with the outfit holding more amused niggers, P.
and Pop saying nothing, me sitting there cold, crazy-stubborn-furious, determined to break his neck rather than walk up and perhaps start him off over that heat-hazy, baking, noontime plain.
Nobody said anything.
I reached up my hand to M’Cola for more cartridges, shot again, carefully, and missed, and on the tenth shot broke his damned neck.
I turned away without looking toward him.
‘Poor Papa,’ P.
said.
‘It’s the light and the wind,’ Pop said.
We had not known each other very well then.
‘They were all hitting the same place.
I could see them throw the dust.
‘I was a bloody, stubborn fool,’ I said.
Anyway, I could shoot now.
So far, and aided by flukes, my luck was running now.
We came on into sight of camp and shouted.
No one came out.
Finally Karl came out of his tent.
He went back as soon as he saw us, then came out again.
‘Hey, Karl,’ I yelled.
He waved and went back in the tent again.
Then came toward us.
He was shaky with excitement and I saw he had been washing blood off his hands.
‘What is it?’.
[Pg 86]‘Rhino,’ he said.
‘Did you get in trouble with him?’.
‘No.
We killed him.
‘Fine.
Where is he?’.
‘Over there behind that tree.
We went over.
There was the newly severed head of a rhino that was a rhino.
He was twice the size of the one I had killed.
The little eyes were shut and a fresh drop of blood stood in the corner of one like a tear.
The head bulked enormous and the horn swept up and back in a fine curve.
The hide was an inch thick where it hung in a cape behind the head and was as white where it was cut as freshly sliced coco-nut.
‘What is he? About thirty inches?’.
‘Hell, no,’ said Pop.
‘Not thirty inches.
‘But he iss a very fine one, Mr.
Jackson,’ Dan said.
‘Yes.
He’s a fine one,’ Pop said.
‘Where did you get him?’.
‘Just outside of camp.
‘He wass standing in some bush.
We heard him grunt.
‘We thought he was a buffalo,’ Karl said.
‘He iss a very fine one,’ Dan repeated.
‘I’m damned glad you got him,’ I said.
There we were, the three of us, wanting to congratulate, waiting to be good sports about this rhino whose smaller horn was longer than our big one, this huge, tear-eyed marvel of a rhino, this dead, head-severed dream rhino, and instead we all spoke like people who were about to become seasick on a boat, or people who[Pg 87] had suffered some heavy financial loss.
We were ashamed and could do nothing about it.
I wanted to say something pleasant and hearty, instead, ‘How many times did you shoot him?’ I asked.
‘I don’t know.
We didn’t count.
Five or six, I guess.
‘Five, I think,’ said Dan.
Poor Karl, faced by these three sad-faced congratulators, was beginning to feel his pleasure in the rhino drained away from him.
‘We got one too,’ said P.
‘That’s fine,’ said Karl.
‘Is he bigger than this one?’.
‘Hell, no.
He’s a lousy runt.
‘I’m sorry,’ Karl said.
He meant it, simply and truly.
‘What the hell have you got to be sorry about with a rhino like that? He’s a beauty.
Let me get the camera and take some pictures of him.
I went after the camera.
took me by the arm and walked close beside me.
‘Papa, please try to act like a human being,’ she said.
‘Poor Karl.
You’re making him feel dreadfully.
‘I know it,’ I said.
‘I’m trying not to act that way.
There was Pop.
He shook his head.
‘I never felt more of a four-letter man,’ he said.
‘But it was like a kick in the stomach.
I’m really delighted, of course.
‘Me too,’ I said.
‘I’d rather have him beat me.
You know that.
Truly.
But why couldn’t he just get a good one, two or three inches longer? Why did he have to get one that makes mine ridiculous? It just makes ours silly.
‘You can always remember that shot.
[Pg 88]‘To hell with that shot.
That bloody fluke.
God, what a beautiful rhino.
‘Come on, let’s pull ourselves together and try to act like white people with him.
‘We were awful,’ P.
said.
‘I know it,’ I said.
‘And all the time I was trying to be jolly.
You know I’m delighted he has it.
‘You were certainly jolly.
Both of you,’ P.
said.
‘But did you see M’Cola,’ Pop asked.
M’Cola had looked at the rhino dismally, shaken his head and walked away.
‘He’s a wonderful rhino,’ P.
said.
‘We must act decently and make Karl feel good.
But it was too late.
We could not make Karl feel good and for a long time we could not feel good ourselves.
The porters came into camp with the loads and we could see them all, and all of our outfit, go over to where the rhino head lay in the shade.
They were all very quiet.
Only the skinner was delighted to see such a rhino head in camp.
‘M’uzuri sana,’ he said to me.
And measured the horn with shiftings of his widespread hand.
‘Kubwa sana!’.
‘N’Dio.
M’uzuri sana,’ I agreed.
‘B’wana Kabor shoot him?’.
‘Yes.
‘M’uzuri sana.
‘Yes,’ I agreed.
‘M’uzuri sana.
The skinner was the only gent in the outfit.
We had tried, in all the shoot, never to be competitive.
Karl and[Pg 89] I had each tried to give the other the better chance on everything that came up.
I was, truly, very fond of him and he was entirely unselfish and altogether self-sacrificing.
I knew I could outshoot him and I could always outwalk him and, steadily, he got trophies that made mine dwarfs in comparison.
He had done some of the worst shooting at game I had ever seen and I had shot badly twice on the trip, at that grant and at a bustard once on the plain, still he beat me on all the tangible things we had to show.
For a while we had joked about it and I knew everything would even up.
But it didn’t even up.
Now, on this rhino hunt, I had taken the first crack at the country.
We had sent him after meat while we had gone into a new country.
We had not treated him badly, but we had not treated him too well, and still he had beaten me.
Not only beaten, beaten was all right.
He had made my rhino look so small that I could never keep him in the same small town where we lived.
He had wiped him out.
I had the shot I had made on him to remember and nothing could take that away except that it was so bloody marvellous I knew I would wonder, sooner or later, if it was not really a fluke in spite of my unholy self-confidence.
Old Karl had put it on us all right with that rhino.
He was in his tent now, writing a letter.
Under the dining tent fly Pop and I talked over what we had better do.
‘He’s got his rhino anyway,’ Pop said.
‘That saves us time.
Now you can’t stand on that one.
‘No.
[Pg 90]‘But this country is washed out.
Something wrong with it.
Droopy claims to know a good country about three hours from here in the lorries and another hour or so on with the porters.
We can head for there this afternoon with a light outfit, send the lorries back, and Karl and Dan can move on down to M’uto Umbu and he can get his oryx.
‘Fine.
‘He has a chance to get a leopard on that rhino carcass this evening, too, or in the morning.
Dan said they heard one.
We’ll try to get a rhino out of this country of Droopy’s and then you join up with them and go on for kudu.
We want to leave plenty of time for them.
‘Fine.
‘Even if you don’t get an oryx.
You’ll pick one up somewhere.
‘Even if I don’t get one at all, it’s all right.
We’ll get one another time.
I want a kudu, though.
‘You’ll get one.
You’re sure to.
‘I’d rather get one, a good one, than all the rest.
I don’t give a damn about these rhino outside of the fun of hunting them.
But I’d like to get one that wouldn’t look silly beside that dream rhino of his.
‘Absolutely.
So we told Karl and he said: ‘Whatever you say.
Sure.
I hope you get one twice as big.
’ He really meant it.
He was feeling better now and so were we all.
[Pg 91].
[Pg 92].
CHAPTER THREE.
Droopy’s country, when we reached it that evening, after a hot ride through red-soiled, bush-scrubby hills, looked awful.
It was at the edge of a belt where all the trees had been girdled to kill the tsetse flies.
And across from camp was a dusty, dirty native village.
The soil was red and eroded and seemed to be blowing away, and camp was pitched in a high wind under the sketchy shade of some dead trees on a hillside overlooking a little stream and the mud village beyond.
Before dark we followed Droopy and two local guides up past the village and in a long climb to the top of a rock-strewn ridge that overlooked a deep valley that was almost a canyon.
Across[Pg 93] on the other side, were broken valleys that sloped steeply down into the canyon.
There were heavy growths of trees in the valleys and grassy slopes on the ridges between, and above there was the thick bamboo forest of the mountain.
The canyon ran down to the Rift Valley, seeming to narrow at the far end where it cut through the wall of the rift.
Beyond, above the grassy ridges and slopes, were heavily forested hills.
It looked a hell of a country to hunt.
‘If you see one across there you have to go straight down to the bottom of the canyon.
Then up one of those timber patches and across those damned gullies.
You[Pg 94] can’t keep him in sight and you’ll kill yourself climbing.
It’s too steep.
Those are the kind of innocent-looking gullies we got into that night coming home.
‘It looks very bad,’ Pop agreed.
‘I’ve hunted a country just like this for deer.
The south slope of Timber Creek in Wyoming.
The slopes are all too steep.
It’s hell.
It’s too broken.
We’ll take some punishment to-morrow.
said nothing.
Pop had brought us here and Pop would bring us out.
All she had to do was see her boots did not hurt her feet.
They hurt just a little now, and that was her only worry.
I went on to dilate on the difficulties the country showed and we went home to camp in the dark all very gloomy and full of prejudice against Droopy.
The fire flamed brightly in the wind and we sat and watched the moon rise and listened to the hyenas.
After we had a few drinks we did not feel so badly about the country.
‘Droopy swears it’s good,’ Pop said.
‘This isn’t where he wanted to go though, he says.
It was another place farther on.
But he swears this is good.
‘I love Droopy,’ P.
said.
‘I have perfect confidence in Droopy.
Droopy came up to the fire with two spear-carrying natives.
‘What does he hear?’ I asked.
There was some talk by the natives, then Pop said: ‘One of these sportsmen claims he was chased by a huge rhino to-day.
Of course nearly any rhino would look huge when he was chasing him.
[Pg 95]‘Ask him how long the horn was.
The native showed that the horn was as long as his arm.
Droopy grinned.
‘Tell him to go,’ said Pop.
‘Where did all this happen?’.
‘Oh, over there somewhere,’ Pop said.
‘You know.
Over there.
Way over there.
Where these things always happen.
‘That’s marvellous.
Just where we want to go.
‘The good aspect is that Droopy’s not at all depressed,’ Pop said.
‘He seems very confident.
After all, it’s his show.
‘Yes, but we have to do the climbing.
‘Cheer him up, will you?’ Pop said to P.
‘He’s getting me very depressed.
‘Should we talk about how well he shoots?’.
‘Too early in the evening.
I’m not gloomy.
I’ve just seen that kind of country before.
It will be good for us all right.
Take some of your belly off, Governor.
The next day I found that I was all wrong about that country.
We had breakfast before daylight and were started before sunrise, climbing the hill beyond the village in single file.
Ahead there was the local guide with a spear, then Droopy with my heavy gun and a water bottle, then me with the Springfield, Pop with the Mannlicher, P.
pleased, as always to carry nothing, M’Cola with Pop’s heavy gun and another water bottle, and finally[Pg 96] two local citizens with spears, water bags, and a chop box with lunch.
We planned to lay up in the heat of the middle of the day and not get back until dark.
It was fine climbing in the cool fresh morning and very different from toiling up this same trail last evening in the sunset with all the rocks and dirt giving back the heat of the day.
The trail was used regularly by cattle and the dust was powdered dry and, now, lightly moistened from the dew.
There were many hyena tracks and, as the trail came on to a ridge of grey rock so that you could look down on both sides into a steep ravine, and then went on along the edge of the canyon, we saw a fresh rhino track in one of the dusty patches below the rocks.
‘He’s just gone on ahead,’ Pop said.
‘They must wander all over here at night.
Below, at the bottom of the canyon, we could see the tops of high trees and in an opening see the flash of water.
Across were the steep hillside and the gullies we had studied last night.
Droopy and the local guide, the one who had been chased by the rhino, were whispering together.
Then they started down a steep path that went in long slants down the side of the canyon.
We stopped.
I had not seen P.
was limping, and in sudden whispered family bitterness there was a highly-righteous-on-both-sides clash, historically on unwearable shoes and boots in the past, and imperatively on these, which hurt.
The hurt was lessened by cutting off the toes of the heavy short wool socks worn over ordinary socks, and then, by removing the socks entirely, the boots made possible.
Going down-hill steeply made[Pg 97] these Spanish shooting boots too short in the toe and there was an old argument, about this length of boot and whether the bootmaker, whose part I had taken, unwittingly first, only as interpreter, and finally embraced his theory patriotically as a whole and, I believed, by logic, had overcome it by adding on to the heel.
But they hurt now, a stronger logic, and the situation was unhelped by the statement that men’s new boots always hurt for weeks before they became comfortable.
Now, heavy socks removed, stepping tentatively, trying the pressure of the leather against the toes, the argument past, she wanting not to suffer, but to keep up and please Mr.
, me ashamed at having been a four-letter man about boots, at being righteous against pain, at being righteous at all, at ever being righteous, stopping to whisper about it, both of us grinning at what was whispered, it all right now, the boots too, without the heavy socks, much better, me hating all righteous bastards now, one absent American friend especially, having just removed myself from that category, certainly never to be righteous again, watching Droopy ahead, we went down the long slant of the trail toward the bottom of the canyon where the trees were heavy and tall and the floor of the canyon, that from above had been a narrow gash, opened to a forest-banked stream.
We stood now in the shade of trees with great smooth trunks, circled at their base with the line of roots that showed in rounded ridges up the trunks like arteries; the trunks the yellow green of a French forest on a day in winter after rain.
But these trees had a great spread of[Pg 98] branches and were in leaf and below them, in the stream bed in the sun, reeds like papyrus grass grew thick as wheat and twelve feet tall.
There was a game trail through the grass along the stream and Droopy was bent down looking at it.
M’Cola went over and looked and they both followed it a little way, stooped close over it, then came back to us.
‘Nyati,’ M’Cola whispered.
‘Buffalo.
’ Droopy whispered to Pop and then Pop said, softly in his throaty, whisky whisper, ‘They’re buff gone down the river.
Droop says there are some big bulls.
They haven’t come back.
‘Let’s follow them,’ I said.
‘I’d rather get another buff than rhino.
‘It’s as good a chance as any for rhino, too,’ Pop said.
‘By God, isn’t it a great looking country?’ I said.
‘Splendid,’ Pop said.
‘Who would have imagined it?’.
‘The trees are like André’s pictures,’ P.
said.
‘It’s simply beautiful.
Look at that green.
It’s Masson.
Why can’t a good painter see this country?’.
‘How are your boots?’.
‘Fine.
As we trailed the buffalo we went very slowly and quietly.
There was no wind and we knew that when the breeze came up it would be from the east and blow up the canyon toward us.
We followed the game trail down the river-bed and as we went the grass was much higher.
Twice we had to get down to crawl and the reeds were so thick you could not see two feet into them.
Droop[Pg 99] found a fresh rhino track, too, in the mud.
I began to think about what would happen if a rhino came barging along this tunnel and who would do what.
It was exciting but I did not like it.
It was too much like being in a trap and there was P.
to think about.
Then as the stream made a bend and we came out of the high grass to the bank I smelled game very distinctly.
I do not smoke, and hunting at home I have several times smelled elk in the rutting season before I have seen them, and I can smell clearly where an old bull has lain in the forest.
The bull elk has a strong musky smell.
It is a strong but pleasant odour and I know it well, but this smell I did not know.
‘I can smell them,’ I whispered to Pop.
He believed me.
‘What is it?’.
‘I don’t know but it’s plenty strong.
Can’t you?’.
‘No.
‘Ask Droop.
Droopy nodded and grinned.
‘They take snuff,’ Pop said.
‘I don’t know whether they can scent or not.
We went on into another bed of reeds that were high over our heads, putting each foot down silently before lifting the other, walking as quietly as in a dream or a slow motion picture.
I could smell whatever it was clearly now, all of the time, sometimes stronger than at others.
I did not like it at all.
We were close to the bank now, and ahead, the game trail went straight out into a long slough of higher reeds than any we had come through.
[Pg 100]‘I can smell them close as hell,’ I whispered to Pop.
‘No kidding.
Really.
‘I believe you,’ Pop said.
‘Should we get up here on to the bank and skirt this bit? We’ll be above it.
‘Good.
’ Then, when we were up, I said.
‘That tall stuff had me spooked.
I wouldn’t like to hunt in that.
‘How’d you like to hunt elephant in that?’ Pop whispered.
‘I wouldn’t do it.
‘Do you really hunt elephant in grass like that?’ P.
asked.
‘Yes,’ Pop said.
‘Get up on somebody’s shoulders to shoot.
Better men than I am do it, I thought.
I wouldn’t do it.
We went along the grassy right bank, on a sort of shelf, now in the open, skirting a slough of high dry reeds.
Beyond on the opposite bank were the heavy trees and above them the steep bank of the canyon.
You could not see the stream.
Above us, on the right, were the hills, wooded in patches of orchard bush.
Ahead, at the end of the slough of reeds the banks narrowed and the branches of the big trees almost covered the stream.
Suddenly Droopy grabbed me and we both crouched down.
He put the big gun in my hand and took the Springfield.
He pointed and around a curve in the bank I saw the head of a rhino with a long, wonderful-looking horn.
The head was swaying and I could see the ears forward and twitching, and see the little pig eyes.
I slipped the safety catch and motioned Droopy down.
Then I heard M’Cola saying, ‘Toto! Toto!’ and he grabbed my[Pg 101] arm.
Droopy was whispering, ‘Manamouki! Manamouki! Manamouki!’ very fast and he and M’Cola were frantic that I should not shoot.
It was a cow rhino with a calf, and as I lowered the gun she gave a snort, crashed in the reeds, and was gone.
I never saw the calf.
We could see the reeds swaying where the two of them were moving and then it was all quiet.
‘Damn shame,’ Pop whispered.
‘She had a beautiful horn.
‘I was all set to bust her,’ I said.
‘I couldn’t tell she was a cow.
‘M’Cola saw the calf.
M’Cola was whispering to Pop and nodding his head emphatically.
‘He says there’s another rhino in there,’ Pop said.
‘That he heard him snort.
‘Let’s get higher, where we can see them if they break, and throw something in,’ I said.
‘Good idea,’ Pop agreed.
‘Maybe the bull’s there.
We went a little higher up the bank where we could look out over the lake of high reeds and, with Pop holding his big gun ready and I with the safety off mine, M’Cola threw a club into the reeds where he had heard the snort.
There was a wooshing snort and no movement, not a stir in the reeds.
Then there was a crashing farther away and we could see the reeds swaying with the rush of something through them toward the opposite bank, but could not see what was making the movement.
Then I saw the black back, the wide-swept, point-lifted horns and then the quick-moving, climbing rush of a buffalo[Pg 102] up the other bank.
He went up, his neck up and out, his head horn-heavy, his withers rounded like a fighting bull, in fast strong-legged climb.
I was holding on the point where his neck joined his shoulder when Pop stopped me.
‘He’s not a big one,’ he said softly.
‘I wouldn’t take him unless you want him for meat.
He looked big to me and now he stood, his head up, broadside, his head swung toward us.
‘I’ve got three more on the licence and we’re leaving their country,’ I said.
‘It’s awfully good meat,’ Pop whispered.
‘Go ahead then.
Bust him.
But be ready for the rhino after you shoot.
I sat down, the big gun feeling heavy and unfamiliar, held on the buff’s shoulder, squeezed off and flinched without firing.
Instead of the sweet clean pull of the Springfield with the smooth, unhesitant release at the end, this trigger came to what, in a squeeze, seemed metal stuck against metal.
It was like when you shoot in a nightmare.
I couldn’t squeeze it and I corrected from my flinch, held my breath, and pulled the trigger.
It pulled off with a jerk and the big gun made a rocking explosion out of which I came, seeing the buffalo still on his feet, and going out of sight to the left in a climbing run, to let off the second barrel and throw a burst of rock dust and dirt over his hind quarters.
He was out of shot before I could reload the double-barrelled ·470 and we had all heard the snorting and the crashing of another rhino that had gone out of the lower end of the reeds and[Pg 103] on under the heavy trees on our side without showing more than a glimpse of his bulk in the reeds.
‘It was the bull,’ Pop said.
‘He’s gone down the stream.
‘N’Dio.
Doumi! Doumi!’ Droopy insisted it was a bull.
‘I hit the damned buff,’ I said.
‘God knows where.
To hell with those heavy guns.
The trigger pull put me off.
‘You’d have killed him with the Springfield,’ Pop said.
‘I’d know where I hit him anyway.
I thought with the four-seven I’d kill him or miss him,’ I said.
‘Instead, now we’ve got him wounded.
‘He’ll keep,’ Pop said.
‘We want to give him plenty of time.
‘I’m afraid I gut-shot him.
‘You can’t tell.
Going off fast like that he might be dead in a hundred yards.
‘The hell with that four-seventy,’ I said.
‘I can’t shoot it.
The trigger’s like the last turn of the key opening a sardine can.
‘Come on,’ Pop said.
‘We’ve got God knows how many rhino scattered about here.
‘What about the buff?’.
‘Plenty of time for him later.
We must let him stiffen up.
Let him get sick.
‘Suppose we’d been down there with all that stuff coming out.
‘Yes,’ said Pop.
All this in whispers.
I looked at P.
She was like someone enjoying a good musical show.
[Pg 104]‘Did you see where it hit him?’.
‘I couldn’t tell?’ she whispered.
‘Do you suppose there are any more in there?’.
‘Thousands,’ I said.
‘What do we do, Pop?’.
‘That bull may be just around the bend,’ Pop said.
‘Come on.
We went along the bank, our nerves cocked, and as we came to the narrow end of the reeds there was another rush of something heavy through the tall stalks.
I had the gun up waiting for whatever it was to show.
But there was only the waving of the reeds.
M’Cola signalled with his hand not to shoot.
‘The calf,’ Pop said.
‘Must have been two of them.
Where’s the bloody bull?’.
‘How the hell do you see them?’.
‘Tell by the size.
Then we were standing looking down into the stream bed, into the shadows under the branches of the big trees, and off ahead down the stream when M’Cola pointed up the hill on our right.
‘Faro,’ he whispered and reached me the glasses.
There on the hillside, head-on, wide, black, looking straight towards us, ears twitching and head lifted, swaying as the nose searched for the wind, was another rhino.
He looked huge in the glasses.
Pop was studying him with his binoculars.
‘He’s no better than what you have,’ he said softly.
‘I can bust him right in the sticking place,’ I whispered.
‘You have only one more,’ Pop whispered.
‘You want a good one.
[Pg 105]I offered the glasses to P.
‘I can see him without,’ she said.
‘He’s huge.
‘He may charge,’ Pop said.
‘Then you’ll have to take him.
Then, as we watched, another rhino came into sight from behind a wide feathery-topped tree.
He was quite a bit smaller.
‘By God, it’s a calf,’ Pop said.
‘That one’s a cow.
Good thing you didn’t shoot her.
She bloody well may charge too.
‘Is it the same cow?’ I whispered.
‘No.
That other one had a hell of a horn.
We all had the nervous exhilaration, like a laughing drunk, that a sudden over-abundance, idiotic abundance of game makes.
It is a feeling that can come from any sort of game or fish that is ordinarily rare and that, suddenly, you find in a ridiculously unbelievable abundance.
‘Look at her.
She knows there’s something wrong.
But she can’t see us or smell us.
‘She heard the shots.
‘She knows we’re here.
But she can’t make it out.
The rhino looked so huge, so ridiculous, and so fine to see, and I sighted on her chest.
‘It’s a nice shot.
‘Perfect,’ Pop said.
‘What are we going to do?’ P.
said.
She was practical.
‘We’ll work around her,’ Pop said.
‘If we keep low I don’t believe our scent will carry up there once we’re past.
[Pg 106]‘You can’t tell,’ Pop said.
‘We don’t want her to charge.
She did not charge, but dropped her head, finally, and worked up the hill followed by the nearly full-grown calf.
‘Now,’ said Pop, ‘we’ll let Droop go ahead and see if he can find the bull’s tracks.
We might as well sit down.
We sat in the shade and Droopy went up one side of the stream and the local guide the other.
They came back and said the bull had gone on down.
‘Did any one ever see what sort of horn he had?’ I asked.
‘Droop said he was good.
M’Cola had gone up the hill a little way.
Now he crouched and beckoned.
‘Nyati,’ he said with his hand up to his face.
‘Where?’ Pop asked him.
He pointed, crouched down, and as we crawled up to him he handed me the glasses.
They were a long way away on the jutting ridge of one of the steep hillsides on the far side of the canyon, well down the stream.
We could see six, then eight buffalo, black, heavy necked, the horns shining, standing on the point of a ridge.
Some were grazing and others stood, their heads up, watching.
‘That one’s a bull,’ Pop said, looking through the glasses.
‘Which one?’.
‘Second from the right.
‘They all look like bulls to me.
‘They’re a long way away.
That one’s a good bull.
Now we’ve got to cross the stream and work down toward them and try to get above them.
[Pg 107]‘Will they stay there?’.
‘No.
Probably they’ll work down into this stream bed as soon as it’s hot.
‘Let’s go.
We crossed the stream on a log and then another log and on the other side, half way up the hillside, there was a deeply worn game trail that graded along the bank under the heavily leafed branches of the trees.
We went along quite fast, but walking carefully, and below us, now, the stream bed was covered solidly with foliage.
It was still early in the morning but the breeze was rising and the leaves stirred over our heads.
We crossed one ravine that came down to the stream, going into the thick bush to be out of sight and stooping as we crossed behind trees in the small open place, then, using the shoulder of the ravine as protection, we climbed so that we might get high up the hillside above the buffalo and work down to them.
We stopped in the shelter of the ridge, me sweating heavily and fixing a handkerchief inside the sweatband of my Stetson, and sent Droop ahead to look.
He came back to say they were gone.
From above we could see nothing of them, so we cut across the ravine and the hillside thinking we might intercept them on their way down into the river bed.
The next hillside had been burned and at the bottom of the hill there was a burned area of bush.
In the ash dust were the tracks of the buffalo as they came down and into the thick jungle of the stream bed.
Here it was too overgrown and there were too many vines to follow them.
There were no tracks going down the stream so we knew they were[Pg 108] down in the part of the stream bed we had looked down on from the game trail.
Pop said there was nothing to do about them in there.
It was so thick that if we jumped them we could not get a shot.
You could not tell one from another, he said.
All you could see would be a rush of black.
An old bull would be grey but a good herd bull might be as black as a cow.
It wasn’t any good to jump them like that.
It was ten o’clock now and very hot in the open, the sun pegged and the breeze lifted the ashes of the burned-over ground as we walked.
Everything would be in the thick cover now.
We decided to find a shady place and lie down and read in the cool; to have lunch and kill the hot part of the day.
Beyond the burned place we came toward the stream and stopped, sweating, in the shadow of some very large trees.
We unpacked our leather coats and our raincoats and spread them on the grass at the foot of the trees so that we could lean back against the trunks.
got out the books and M’Cola made a small fire and boiled water for tea.
The breeze was coming up and we could hear it in the high branches.
It was cool in the shade, but if you stirred into the sun, or as the sun shifted the shadow while you read so that any part of you was out of the shadow, the sun was heavy.
Droopy had gone on down the stream to have a look, and as we lay there, reading, I could smell the heat of the day coming, the drying up of the dew, the heat on the leaves, and the heaviness of the sun over the stream.
[Pg 109]P.
was reading Spanish Gold, by George A.
Birmingham, and she said it was no good.
I still had the Sevastopol book of Tolstoy and in the same volume I was reading a story called ‘The Cossacks’ that was very good.
In it were the summer heat, the mosquitoes, the feel of the forest in the different seasons, and that river that the Tartars crossed, raiding, and I was living in that Russia again.
I was thinking how real that Russia of the time of our Civil War was, as real as any other place, as Michigan, or the prairie north of town and the woods around Evan’s game farm, of how, through Turgenev, I knew that I had lived there, as I had been in the family Buddenbrooks, and had climbed in and out of her window in Le Rouge et Le Noir, or the morning we had come in the gates of Paris and seen Salcède torn apart by the horses at the Place de Grèves.
I saw all that.
And it was me they did not break on the rack that time because I had been polite to the executioner the time they killed Coconas and me, and I remember the Eve of St.
Bartholomew’s and how we hunted Huguenots that night, and when they trapped me at her house that time, and no feeling more true than finding the gate of the Louvre being closed, nor of looking down at his body in the water where he fell from the mast, and always, Italy, better than any book, lying in the chestnut woods, and in the fall mist behind the Duomo going across the town to the Ospedale Maggiore, the nails in my boots on the cobbles, and in the spring sudden showers in the mountains and the smell of the regiment like a copper coin in your mouth.
So in the[Pg 110] heat the train stopped at Dezenzano and there was Lago de Garda and those troops are the Czech Legion, and the next time it was raining, and the next time it was in the dark, and the next time you passed it riding in a truck, and the next time you were coming from somewhere else, and the next time you walked to it in the dark from Sermione.
For we have been there in the books and out of the books—and where we go, if we are any good, there you can go as we have been.
A country, finally, erodes and the dust blows away, the people all die and none of them were of any importance permanently, except those who practised the arts, and these now wish to cease their work because it is too lonely, too hard to do, and is not fashionable.
A thousand years makes economics silly and a work of art endures for ever, but it is very difficult to do and now it is not fashionable.
People do not want to do it any more because they will be out of fashion and the lice who crawl on literature will not praise them.
Also it is very hard to do.
So what? So I would go on reading about the river that the Tartars came across when raiding, and the drunken old hunter and the girl and how it was then in the different seasons.
Pop was reading Richard Carvell.
We had bought what there was to buy in Nairobi and we were pretty well to the end of the books.
‘I’ve read this before,’ Pop said.
‘But it’s a good story.
‘I can just remember it.
But it was a good story then.
‘It’s a jolly good story, but I wish I hadn’t read it before.
[Pg 111]‘This is terrible,’ P.
said.
‘You couldn’t read it.
‘Do you want this one?’.
‘Don’t be ornamental,’ she said.
‘No, I’ll finish this.
‘Go on.
Take it.
‘I’ll give it right back.
‘Hey, M’Cola,’ I said.
‘Beer?’.
‘N’Dio,’ he said with great force, and from the chop box one of the natives had carried on his head produced, in its straw casing, a bottle of German beer, one of the sixty-four bottles Dan had brought from the German trading station.
Its neck was wrapped in silver foil and on its black and yellow label there was a horseman in armour.
It was still cool from the night and opened by the tin-opener it creamed into three cups, thick-foamed, full-bodied.
‘No,’ said Pop.
‘Very bad for the liver.
‘Come on.
‘All right.
We all drank and when M’Cola opened the second bottle Pop refused, firmly.
‘Go on.
It means more to you.
I’m going to take a nap.
‘Poor old Mama?’.
‘Just a little.
‘All for me,’ I said.
M’Cola smiled and shook his head at this drinking.
I lay back against the tree and watched the wind bringing the clouds and drank the beer slowly out of the bottle.
It was cooler that way and it was excellent beer.
After a while Pop and P.
were both asleep and I got back the Sevastopol book and read in ‘The Cossacks’ again.
It was a good story.
[Pg 112]When they woke up we had lunch of cold sliced tenderloin, bread, and mustard, and a can of plums, and drank the third, and last, bottle of beer.
Then we read again and all went to sleep.
I woke thirsty and was unscrewing the top from a water bottle when I heard a rhino snort and crash in the brush of the river bed.
Pop was awake and heard it too and we took our guns, without speaking, and started toward where the noise had come from.
M’Cola found the tracks.
The rhino had come up the stream, evidently he had winded us when he was only about thirty yards away, and had gone on up.
We could not follow the tracks the way the wind was blowing so we circled away from the stream and back to the edge of the burned place to get above him and then hunted very carefully against the wind along the stream through very thick bush, but we did not find him.
Finally Droopy found where he had gone up the other side and on into the hills.
From the tracks it did not seem a particularly large one.
We were a long way from camp, at least four hours as we had come, and much of it up-hill going back, certainly there would be that long climb out of the canyon; we had a wounded buffalo to deal with, and when we came out on the edge of the burned country again, we agreed that we should get P.
and get started.
It was still hot, but the sun was on its way down and for a good way we would be on the heavily shaded game trail on the high bank above the stream.
When we found P.
she pretended to be indignant at our going off and leaving her alone but she was only teasing us.
[Pg 113]We started off, Droop and his spearsman in the lead, walking along the shadow of the trail that was broken by the sun through the leaves.
Instead of the cool early morning smell of the forest there was a nasty stink like the mess cats make.
‘What makes the stink?’ I whispered to Pop.
‘Baboons,’ he said.
A whole tribe of them had gone on just ahead of us and their droppings were everywhere.
We came up to the place where the rhinos and the buff had come out of the reeds and I located where I thought the buff had been when I shot.
M’Cola and Droopy were casting about like hounds and I thought they were at least fifty yards too high up the bank when Droop held up a leaf.
‘He’s got blood,’ Pop said.
We went up to them.
There was a great quantity of blood, black now on the grass, and the trail was easy to follow.
Droop and M’Cola trailed one on each side, leaving the trail between them, pointing to each blood spot formally with a long stem of grass.
I always thought it would be better for one to trail slowly and the other cast ahead but this was the way they trailed, stooped heads, pointing each dried splash with their grass stems and occasionally, when they picked up the tracks after losing them, stooping to pluck a grass blade or a leaf that had the black stain on it.
I followed them with the Springfield, then came Pop, with P.
behind him.
Droop carried my big gun and Pop had his.
M’Cola had P.
’s Mannlicher slung over his shoulder.
None of us spoke and everyone seemed to regard it as a pretty serious business.
In some high grass[Pg 114] we found blood, at a pretty good height on the grass leaves on both sides of the trail where the buff had gone through the grass.
That meant he was shot clean through.
You could not tell the original colour of the blood now, but I had a moment of hoping he might be shot through the lungs.
But farther on we came on some droppings in the rocks with blood in them and then for a while he had dropped dung wherever he climbed and all of it was blood-spotted.
It looked, now, like a gut shot or one through the paunch.
I was more ashamed of it all the time.
‘If he comes don’t worry about Droopy or the others,’ Pop whispered.
‘They’ll get out of his way.
Stop him.
‘Right up the nose,’ I said.
‘Don’t try anything fancy,’ Pop said.
The trail climbed steadily, then twice looped back on itself and for a time seemed to wander, without plan, among some rocks.
Once it lead down to the stream, crossed a rivulet of it and then came back up on the same bank, grading up through the trees.
‘I think we’ll find him dead,’ I whispered to Pop.
That aimless turn had made me see him, slow and hard hit, getting ready to go down.
‘I hope so,’ Pop said.
But the trail went on, where there was little grass now, and trailing was much slower and more difficult.
There were no tracks now that I could see, only the probable line he would take, verified by a shiny dark splatter of dried blood on a stone.
Several times we lost it entirely and, the three of us making casts, one would find it, point[Pg 115] and whisper ‘Damu’, and we would go on again.
Finally it led down from a rocky hillside with the last of the sun on it, down into the stream bed where there was a long, wide patch of the highest dead reeds that we had seen.
These were higher and thicker even than the slough the buff had come out of in the morning and there were several game trails that went into them.
‘Not good enough to take the little Memsahib in there,’ Pop said.
‘Let her stay here with M’Cola,’ I said.
‘It’s not good enough for the little Memsahib,’ Pop repeated.
‘I don’t know why we let her come.
‘She can wait here.
Droop wants to go on.
‘Right you are.
We’ll have a look.
‘You wait here with M’Cola,’ I whispered over my shoulder.
We followed Droopy into the thick, tall grass that was five feet above our heads, walking carefully on the game trail, stooping forward, trying to make no noise breathing.
I was thinking of the buff the way I had seen them when we had gotten the three that time, how the old bull had come out of the bush, groggy as he was, and I could see the horns, the boss coming far down, the muzzle out, the little eyes, the roll of fat and muscle on his thin-haired, grey, scaly-hided neck, the heavy power and the rage in him, and I admired him and respected him, but he was slow, and all the while we shot I felt that it was fixed and that we had him.
This was different, this was no rapid fire, no pouring it on him as he comes groggy into the open, if he comes now I must be quiet inside and[Pg 116] put it down his nose as he comes with the head out.
He will have to put the head down to hook, like any bull, and that will uncover the old place the boys wet their knuckles on and I will get one in there and then must go sideways into the grass and he would be Pop’s from then on unless I could keep the rifle when I jumped.
I was sure I could get that one in and jump if I could wait and watch his head come down.
I knew I could do that and that the shot would kill him but how long would it take? That was the whole thing.
How long would it take? Now, going forward, sure he was in here, I felt the elation, the best elation of all, of certain action to come, action in which you had something to do, in which you can kill and come out of it, doing something you are ignorant about and so not scared, no one to worry about and no responsibility except to perform something you feel sure you can perform, and I was walking softly ahead watching Droopy’s back and remembering to keep the sweat out of my glasses when I heard a noise behind us and turned my head.
It was P.
with M’Cola coming on our tracks.
‘For God’s sake,’ Pop said.
He was furious.
We got her back out of the grass and up on to the bank and made her realize that she must stay there.
She had not understood that she was to stay behind.
She had heard me whisper something but thought it was for her to come behind M’Cola.
‘That spooked me,’ I said to Pop.
‘She’s like a little terrier,’ he said.
‘But it’s not good enough.
[Pg 117]We were looking out over that grass.
‘Droop wants to go still,’ I said.
‘I’ll go as far as he will.
When he says no that lets us out.
After all, I gut-shot the son of a bitch.
‘Mustn’t do anything silly, though.
‘I can kill the son of a bitch if I get a shot at him.
If he comes he’s got to give me a shot.
The fright P.
had given us about herself had made me noisy.
‘Come on,’ said Pop.
We followed Droopy back in and it got worse and worse, and I do not know about Pop but about half-way I changed to the big gun and kept the safety off and my hand over the trigger guard and I was plenty nervous by the time Droopy stopped and shook his head and whispered ‘Hapana’.
It had gotten so you could not see a foot ahead and it was all turns and twists.
It was really bad and the sun was only on the hillside now.
We both felt good because we had made Droopy do the calling off and I was relieved as well.
What we had followed him into had made my fancy shooting plans seem very silly and I knew all we had in there was Pop to blast him over with the four-fifty number two after I’d maybe miss him with that lousy four-seventy.
I had no confidence in anything but its noise any more.
We were back trailing when we heard the porters on the hillside shout and we ran crashing through the grass to try to get a high enough place to see to shoot.
They waved their arms and shouted that the buffalo had come out of the reeds and gone past them and then M’Cola and Droopy were pointing, and Pop had me by the sleeve[Pg 118] trying to pull me to where I could see them and then, in the sunlight, high up on the hillside against the rocks I saw two buffalo.
They shone very black in the sun and one was much bigger than the other and I remember thinking this was our bull and that he had picked up a cow and she had made the pace and kept him going.
Droop had handed me the Springfield and I slipped my arm through the sling and sighting, the buff now all seen through the aperture, I froze myself inside and held the bead on the top of his shoulder and as I started to squeeze he started running and I swung ahead of him and loosed off.
I saw him lower his head and jump like a bucking horse as he comes out of the chutes and as I threw the shell, slammed the bolt forward and shot again, behind him as he went out of sight, I knew I had him.
Droopy and I started to run and as we were running I heard a low bellow.
I stopped and yelled at Pop, ‘Hear him? I’ve got him, I tell you!’.
‘You hit him,’ said Pop.
‘Yes.
‘Goddamn it, I killed him.
Didn’t you hear him bellow?’.
‘No.
‘Listen!’ We stood listening and there it came, clear, a long, moaning, unmistakable bellow.
‘By God,’ Pop said.
It was a very sad noise.
M’Cola grabbed my hand and Droopy slapped my back and all laughing we started on a running scramble, sweating, rushing, up the ridge through the trees and over rocks.
I had to stop for breath, my heart pounding, and wiped the sweat off my face and cleaned my glasses.
[Pg 119]‘Kufa!’ M’Cola said, making the word for dead almost explosive in its force.
‘N’Dio! Kufa!’.
‘Kufa!’ Droopy said grinning.
‘Kufa!’ M’Cola repeated and we shook hands again before we went on climbing.
Then, ahead of us, we saw him, on his back, throat stretched out to the full, his weight on his horns, wedged against a tree.
M’Cola put his finger in the bullet hole in the centre of the shoulder and shook his head happily.
Pop and P.
came up, followed by the porters.
‘By God, he’s a better bull than we thought,’ I said.
‘He’s not the same bull.
This is a real bull.
That must have been our bull with him.
‘I thought he was with a cow.
It was so far away I couldn’t tell.
‘It must have been four hundred yards.
By God, you can shoot that little pipsqueak.
‘When I saw him put his head down between his legs and buck I knew we had him.
The light was wonderful on him.
‘I knew you had hit him, and I knew he wasn’t the same bull.
So I thought we had two wounded buffalo to deal with.
I didn’t hear the first bellow.
‘It was wonderful when we heard him bellow,’ P.
said.
‘It’s such a sad sound.
It’s like hearing a horn in the woods.
‘It sounded awfully jolly to me,’ Pop said.
‘By God, we deserve a drink on this.
That was a shot.
Why didn’t you ever tell us you could shoot?’.
‘Go to hell.
[Pg 120]‘You know he’s a damned good tracker, too, and what kind of a bird shot?’ he asked P.
‘Isn’t he a beautiful bull?’ P.
asked.
‘He’s a fine one.
He’s not old but it’s a fine head.
We tried to take pictures but there was only the little box camera and the shutter stuck, and there was a bitter argument about the shutter while the light failed, and I was nervous now, irritable, righteous, pompous about the shutter and inclined to be abusive because we could get no picture.
You cannot live on a plane of the sort of elation I had felt in the reeds and having killed, even when it is only a buffalo, you feel a little quiet inside.
Killing is not a feeling that you share and I took a drink of water and told P.
I was sorry I was such a bastard about the camera.
She said it was all right and we were all right again looking at the buff with M’Cola making the cuts for the headskin and we standing close together and feeling fond of each other and understanding everything, camera and all.
I took a drink of the whisky and it had no taste and I felt no kick from it.
‘Let me have another,’ I said.
The second one was all right.
We were going on ahead to camp with the chased-by-a-rhino spearman as guide and Droop was going to skin out the head and they were going to butcher and cache the meat in trees so the hyenas would not get it.
They were afraid to travel in the dark and I told Droopy he could keep my big gun.
He said he knew how to shoot so I took out the shells and put on the safety and handing it to him told him to shoot.
He put it to his shoulder,[Pg 121] shut the wrong eye, and pulled hard on the trigger, and again, and again.
Then I showed him about the safety and had him put it on and off and snap the gun a couple of times.
M’Cola became very superior during Droopy’s struggle to fire with the safety on and Droopy seemed to get much smaller.
I left him the gun and two cartridges and they were all busy butchering in the dusk when we followed the spearsman and the tracks of the smaller buff, which had no blood on them, up to the top of the hill and on our way toward home.
We climbed around the tops of valleys, went across gulches, up and down ravines and finally came on to the main ridge, it dark and cold in the evening, the moon not yet up, we plodded along, all tired.
Once M’Cola, in the dark, loaded with Pop’s heavy gun and an assortment of water bottles, binoculars, and a musette bag of books, sung out a stream of what sounded like curses at the guide who was striding ahead.
‘What’s he say?’ I asked Pop.
‘He’s telling him not to show off his speed.
That there is an old man in the party.
‘Who does he mean, you or himself?’.
‘Both of us.
We saw the moon come up, smoky red over the brown hills, and we came down through the chinky lights of the village, the mud houses all closed tight, and the smells of goats and sheep, and then across the stream and up the bare slope to where the fire was burning in front of our tents.
It was a cold night with much wind.
In the morning we hunted, picked up a track at a[Pg 122] spring and trailed a rhino all over the high orchard country before he went down into a valley that led, steeply, into the canyon.
It was very hot and the tight boots of the day before had chafed P.
’s feet.
She did not complain about them but I could see they hurt her.
We were all luxuriantly, restfully tired.
‘The hell with them,’ I said to Pop.
‘I don’t want to kill another one unless he’s big.
We might hunt a week for a good one.
Let’s stand on the one we have and pull out and join Karl.
We can hunt oryx down there and get those zebra hides and get on after the kudu.
We were sitting under a tree on the summit of a hill and could see off over all the country and the canyon running down to the Rift Valley and Lake Manyara.
‘It would be good fun to take porters and a light outfit and hunt on ahead of them down through that valley and out to the lake,’ Pop said.
‘That would be swell.
We could send the lorries around to meet us at what’s the name of the place?’.
‘Maji-Moto.
‘Why don’t we do that?’ P.
asked.
‘We’ll ask Droopy how the valley is.
Droopy didn’t know but the spearman said it was very rough and bad going where the stream came down through the rift wall.
He did not think we could get the loads through.
We gave it up.
‘That’s the sort of trip to make, though,’ Pop said.
‘Porters don’t cost as much as petrol.
‘Can’t we make trips like that when we come back?’ P.
asked.
[Pg 123]‘Yes,’ Pop said.
‘But for a big rhino you want to go up on Mount Kenya.
You’ll get a real one there.
Kudu’s the prize here.
You’d have to go up to Kalal to get one in Kenya.
Then if we get them, we’ll have time to go on down in that Handeni country for sable.
‘Let’s get going,’ I said without moving.
Since a long time we had all felt good about Karl’s rhino.
We were glad he had it and all of that had taken on a correct perspective.
Maybe he had his oryx by now.
I hoped so.
He was a fine fellow, Karl, and it was good he got these extra fine heads.
‘How do you feel, poor old Mama?’.
‘I’m fine.
If we are going I’ll be just as glad to rest my feet.
But I love this kind of hunting.
‘Let’s get back, eat, break camp, and get down there to-night.
That night we got into our old camp at M’utu-Umbu, under the big trees, not far from the road.
It had been our first camp in Africa and the trees were as big, as spreading, and as green, the stream as clear and fast flowing, and the camp as fine as when we had first been there.
The only difference was that now it was hotter at night, the road in was hub-deep in dust, and we had seen a lot of country.
[Pg 124].
CHAPTER FOUR.
We had come down to the Rift Valley by a sandy red road across a high plateau, then up and down through orchard-bushed hills, around a slope of forest to the top of the rift wall where we could look down and see the plain, the heavy forest below the wall, and the long, dried-up edged shine of Lake Manyara rose-coloured at one end with a half million tiny dots that were flamingoes.
From there the road dropped steeply along the face of the wall, down into the forest, on to the flatness of the valley, through cultivated patches of green corn, bananas, and trees I did not know the names of, walled thick with forest, past a Hindu’s trading store and many huts, over[Pg 125] two bridges where clear, fast-flowing streams ran, through more forest, thinning now to open glades, and into a dusty turn-off that led into a deeply rutted, dust-filled track through bushes to the shade of M’utu-Umbu camp.
That night after dinner we heard the flamingoes flighting in the dark.
It was like the sound the wings of ducks make as they go over before it is light, but slower, with a steady beat, and multiplied a thousand times.
Pop and I were a little drunk and P.
was very tired.
Karl was gloomy again.
We had taken the edge from his victories over rhino and now that was past anyway and he[Pg 126] was facing possible defeat by oryx.
Then, too, they had found not a leopard but a marvellous lion, a huge, black-maned lion that did not want to leave, on the rhino carcass when they had gone there the next morning and could not shoot him because he was in some sort of forest reserve.
‘That’s rotten,’ I said and I tried to feel bad about it but I was still feeling much too good to appreciate any one else’s gloom, and Pop and I sat, tired through to our bones, drinking whisky and soda and talking.
The next day we hunted oryx in the dried-up dustiness of the Rift Valley and finally found a herd way off at the edge of the wooded hills on the far side above a Masai village.
They were like a bunch of Masai donkeys except for the beautiful straight-slanting black horns and all the heads looked good.
When you looked closely two or three were obviously better than the others and sitting on the ground I picked what I thought was the very best of the lot and as they strung out I made sure of this one.
I heard the bullet smack and watched the oryx circle out away from the others, the circle quickening, and knew I had it.
So I did not shoot again.
This was the one Karl had picked, too.
I did not know that, but had shot, deliberately selfish, to make sure of the best this time at least, but he got another good one and they went off in a wind-lifted cloud of grey dust as they galloped.
Except for the miracle of their horns there was no more excitement in shooting them than if they had been donkeys, and after the lorry came up and M’Cola and Charo had skinned the heads out and cut up the[Pg 127] meat we rode home in the blowing dust, our faces grey with it, and the valley one long heat mirage.
We stayed at that camp two days.
We had to get some zebra hides that we had promised friends at home and it needed time for the skinner to handle them properly.
Getting the zebra was no fun; the plain was dull, now that the grass had dried, hot and dusty after the hills, and the picture that remains is of sitting against an ant hill with, in the distance, a herd of zebra galloping in the grey heat haze, raising a dust, and on the yellow plain, the birds circling over a white patch there, another beyond, there a third, and looking back, the plume of dust of the lorry coming with the skinners and the men to cut up the meat for the village.
I did some bad shooting in the heat on a Grant’s gazelle that the volunteer skinners asked me to kill them for meat, wounding him in a running shot after missing him three or four times, and then following him across the plain until almost noon in that heat until I got within range and killed him.
But that afternoon we went out along the road that ran through the settlement and past the corner of the Hindu’s general store, where he smiled at us in well-oiled, unsuccessful-storekeeping, brotherly humanity, and hopeful salesmanship, turned the car off to the left on to a track that went into the deep forest, a narrow brush-bordered track through the heavy timber, that crossed a stream on an unsound log and pole bridge and went on until the timber thinned and we came out into a grassy savannah that stretched ahead to the reed-edged, dried-up bed of the lake with, far beyond, the shine of[Pg 128] the water and the rose-pink of the flamingoes.
There were some grass huts of fishermen in the shade of the last trees and ahead the wind blew across the grass of the savannah and the dried bed of the lake showed a white-grey with many small animals humping across its baked surface as our car alarmed them.
They were reed buck and they looked strange and awkward as they moved in the distance but trim and graceful as you saw them standing close.
We turned the car out through the thick, short grass and on to the dried lake floor and everywhere, to the left and to the right, where the streams flowed out into the lake and made a reedy marsh that ran down toward the receded lake, cut by canals of water, ducks were flying and we could see big flocks of geese spread over the grassy hummocks that rose above the marsh.
The dried bed was hard and firm and we drove the car until it commenced to look moist and soft ahead, then left the motor car standing there, and, Karl taking Charo and I, M’Cola, to carry shells and birds, we agreed to work one on one side and one the other of the marsh and try to shoot and keep the birds moving while Pop and P.
went into the edge of the high reeds on the left shore of the lake where another stream made a thick marsh to which we thought the ducks might fly.
We saw them walk across the open, a big bulky figure in a faded corduroy coat and a very small one in trousers, grey khaki jacket, boots, and a big hat, and then disappear as they crouched in a point of dried reeds before we started.
But as we went out to reach the edge of the stream we soon saw the plan was no good.
Even watch[Pg 129]ing carefully for the firmest footing you sunk down in the cool mud to the knees, and, as it became less mucky and there were more hummocks broken by water, sometimes I went in to the waist.
The ducks and geese flew up out of range and after the first flock had swung across toward where the others were hidden in the reeds and we heard the sharp, small, double report of P.
’s 28-gauge and saw the ducks wheel off and go out toward the lake, the other scattered flocks and the geese all went toward the open water.
A flock of dark ibises, looking, with their dipped bills, like great curlews, flew over from the marsh on the side of the stream where Karl was and circled high above us before they went back into the reeds.
All through the bog were snipe and black and white godwits and finally, not being able to get within range of the ducks, I began to shoot snipe to M’Cola’s great disgust.
We followed the marsh out and then I crossed another stream, shoulder high, holding my gun and shooting coat with shells in the pocket above my head and finally trying to work toward where P.
and Pop were, found a deep flowing stream where teal were flying, and killed three.
It was nearly dark now and I found Pop and P.
on the far bank of this stream at the edge of the dried lake bed.
It all looked too deep to wade and the bottom was soft but finally I found a heavily worn hippo trail that went into the stream and treading on this, the bottom fairly firm under foot, I made it, the water coming just under my armpits.
As I came out on the grass and stood dripping a flock of teal came over very fast, and, crouching to shoot in the dusk[Pg 130] at the same time Pop did, we cut down three that fell hard in a long slant ahead in the tall grass.
We hunted carefully and found them all.
Their speed had carried them much farther than we expected and then, almost dark now, we started for the car across the grey dried mud of the lake bed, me soaked and my boots squashing water, P.
pleased with the ducks, the first we’d had since the Serengetti, we all remembering how marvellous they were to eat, and ahead we could see the car looking very small and beyond it a stretch of flat, baked mud and then the grassy savannah and the forest.
Next day we came in from the zebra business grey and sweat-caked with dust that the car raised and the wind blew over us on the way home across the plain.
and Pop had not gone out, there was nothing for them to do and no need for them to eat that dust, and Karl and I out on the plain in the too much sun and dust had gone through one of those rows that starts like this, ‘What was the matter?’.
‘They were too far.
‘Not at the start.
‘They were too far, I tell you.
‘They get hard if you don’t take them.
‘You shoot them.
‘I’ve got enough.
We only want twelve hides altogether.
You go ahead.
Then someone, angry, shooting too fast to show he was being asked to shoot too fast, getting up from behind the ant hill and turning away in disgust, walking towards[Pg 131] his partner, who says, smugly, ‘What’s the matter with them?’.
‘They’re too damned far, I tell you,’ desperately.
The smug one, complacently, ‘Look at them’.
The zebra that had galloped off had seen the approaching lorry of the skinners and had circled and were standing now, broadside, in easy range.
The one looks, says nothing, too angry now to shoot.
Then says, ‘Go ahead.
Shoot’.
The smug one, more righteous now than ever, refuses.
‘Go ahead,’ he says.
‘I’m through,’ says the other.
He knows he is too angry to shoot and he feels he has been tricked.
Something is always tricking him, the need to do things other than in a regular order, or by an inexact command in which details are not specified, or to have to do it in front of people, or to be hurried.
‘We’ve got eleven,’ says smug face, sorry now.
He knows he should not hurry him, that he should leave him alone, that he only upsets him by trying to speed him up, and that he has been a smugly righteous bastard again.
‘We can pick up the other one any time.
Come on, Bo, we’ll go in.
‘No, let’s get him.
You get him.
‘No, let’s go in.
And as the car comes up and you ride in through the dust the bitterness goes and there is only the feeling of shortness of time again.
‘What you thinking about now?’ you ask.
‘What a son of a bitch I am, still?’.
[Pg 132]‘About this afternoon,’ he says and grins, making wrinkles in the caked dust on his face.
‘Me too,’ you say.
Finally the afternoon comes and you start.
This time you wear canvas ankle-high shoes, light to pull out when you sink, you work out from hummock to hummock, picking a way across the marsh and wade and flounder through the canals and the ducks fly as before out to the lake, but you make a long circle to the right and come out into the lake itself and find the bottom hard and firm and walking knee deep in the water get outside the big flocks, then there is a shot and you and M’Cola crouch, heads bent, and then the air is full of them, and you cut down two, then two again, and then a high one straight overhead, then miss a fast one straight and low to the right, then they come whistling back, passing faster than you can load and shoot, you brown a bunch to get cripples for decoys and then take only fancy shots because you know now you can get all that we can use or carry.
You try the high one, straight overhead and almost leaning backward, the coup de roi, and splash a big black duck down beside M’Cola, him laughing, then, the four cripples swimming away, you decide you better kill them and pick up.
You have to run in water to your knees to get in range of the last cripple and you slip and go face down and are sitting, enjoying being completely wet finally, water cool on your behind, soaked with muddy water, wiping off glasses, and then getting the water out of the gun, wondering if you can shoot up the shells before they will swell,[Pg 133] M’Cola delighted with the spill.
He, with the shooting coat now full of ducks, crouches and a flock of geese pass over in easy range while you try to pump a wet shell in.
You get a shell in, shoot, but it is too far, or you were behind, and at the shot you see the cloud of flamingoes rise in the sun, making the whole horizon of the lake pink.
Then they settle.
But after that each time after you shoot you turn and look out into the sun on the water and see that quick rise of the unbelievable cloud and then the slow settling.
‘M’Cola,’ you say and point.
‘N’Dio,’ he says, watching them.
‘M’uzuri!’ and hands you more shells.
We all had good shooting but it was best out on the lake and for three days afterward, travelling, we had cold teal, the best of ducks to eat, fine, plump, and tender, cold with Pan-Yan pickles, and the red wine we bought at Babati, sitting by the road waiting for the lorries to come up, sitting on the shady porch of the little hotel at Babati, then late at night when the lorries finally came in and we were at the house of an absent friend of a friend high up in the hills, cold at night, wearing coats at the table, having waited so long for the broken-down lorry to come that we all drank much too much and were unspeakably hungry, P.
dancing with the manager of the coffee shamba, and with Karl, to the gramophone, me shot full of emetine and with a ringing headache drowning it successfully in whisky-soda with Pop on the porch, it dark and the wind blowing a gale, and then those teal coming on the table, smoking hot and with fresh vege[Pg 134]tables.
Guinea hen were all right, and I had one now in the lunch box in the back of the car that I would eat to-night; but those teal were the finest of all.
From Babati we had driven through the hills to the edge of a plain, wooded in a long stretch of glade beyond a small village where there was a mission station at the foot of a mountain.
Here we had made a camp to hunt kudu which were supposed to be in the wooded hills and in the forests on the flats that stretched out to the edge of the open plain.
[Pg 135].
[Pg 136].
CHAPTER FIVE.
It was a hot place to camp, under trees that had been girdled to kill them so that the tsetse fly would leave, and there was hard hunting in the hills, which were steep, brushy, and very broken, with a hard climb before you got up into them, and easy hunting on the wooded flats where you wandered as though through a deer park.
But everywhere were tsetse flies, swarming around you, biting hard on your neck, through your shirt, on arms, and behind the ears.
I carried a leafy branch and swished away at the back of my neck as we walked and we hunted five days, from daylight until dark, coming home after dark, dead tired but glad of the coolness and[Pg 137] of the darkness that stopped the tsetse from biting.
We took turns hunting the hills and the flats and Karl became steadily gloomier although he killed a very fine roan antelope.
He had gotten a very complicated personal feeling about kudu and, as always when he was confused, it was someone’s fault, the guides, the choice of beat, the hills; these all betrayed him.
The hills punished him and he did not believe in the flats.
Each day I hoped he would get one and that the atmosphere would clear but each day his feelings about the kudu complicated the hunting.
He was never a climber and took real punishment in the hills.
I tried to take the bulk of the hill beats to[Pg 138] relieve him but I could see, now that he was tired he felt they probably were in the hills and he was missing his chance.
In the five days I saw a dozen or more kudu cows and one young bull with a string of cows.
The cows were big, grey, striped-flanked antelope with ridiculously small heads, big ears, and a soft, fast-rushing gait that moved them in big-bellied panic through the trees.
The young bull had the start of a spiral on his horns but they were short and dumpy and as he ran past us at the end of a glade in the dusk, third in a string of six cows, he was no more like a real bull than a spike elk is like a big, old, thick-necked, dark-maned, wonder-horned, tawny-hided, beer-horse-built bugler of a bull-elk.
Another time, headed home as the sun went down along a steep valley in the hills, the guides pointed to two grey, white-striped, moving animals, against the sun at the top of the hill, showing only their flanks through the trunks of the trees and said they were kudu bulls.
We could not see the horns and when we got up to the top of the hill the sun was gone and on the rocky ground we could not find their tracks.
But from the glimpse we had they looked higher in the legs than the cows we saw and they might have been bulls.
We hunted the ridges until dark but never saw them again nor did Karl find them the next day when we sent him there.
We jumped many waterbuck and once, still hunting along a ridge with a steep gully below, we came on a waterbuck that had heard us, but not scented us, and as we stood, perfectly quiet, M’Cola holding his hand on[Pg 139] mine, we watched him, only a dozen feet away, standing, beautiful, dark, full-necked, a dark ruff on his neck, his horns up, trembling all over as his nostrils widened searching for the scent.
M’Cola was grinning, pressing his fingers tight on my wrist and we watched the big buck shiver from the danger that he could not locate.
Then there was the distant, heavy boom of a native black powder gun and the buck jumped and almost ran over us as he crashed up the ridge.
Another day, with P.
along, we had hunted all through the timbered flat and come out to the edge of the plain where there were only clumps of bush and sanseviera when we heard a deep, throaty, cough.
I looked at M’Cola.
‘Simba,’ he said, and did not look pleased.
‘Wapi?’ I whispered.
‘Where?’.
He pointed.
I whispered to P.
, ‘It’s a lion.
Probably the one we heard early this morning.
You go back to those trees.
We had heard a lion roaring just before daylight when we were getting up.
‘I’d rather stay with you.
‘It wouldn’t be fair to Pop,’ I said.
‘You wait back there.
‘All right.
But you will be careful.
‘I won’t take anything but a standing shot and I won’t shoot unless I’m sure of him.
‘All right.
‘Come on,’ I said to M’Cola.
He looked very grave and did not like it at all.
‘Wapi Simba?’ I whispered.
[Pg 140]‘Here,’ he said dismally and pointed at the broken islands of thick, green spiky cover.
I motioned to one of the guides to go back with P.
and we watched them go back a couple of hundred yards to the edge of the forest.
‘Come on,’ I said.
M’Cola shook his head without smiling but followed.
We went forward very slowly, looking into and trying to see through the senseviera.
We could see nothing.
Then we heard the cough again, a little ahead and to the right.
‘No!’ M’Cola whispered.
’Hapana, B’wana!’.
‘Come on,’ I said.
I pointed my forefinger into my neck and wriggled the thumb down.
‘Kufa,’ I whispered, meaning that I would shoot the lion in the neck and kill him dead.
M’Cola shook his head, his face grave and sweating.
‘Hapana!’ he whispered.
There was an ant-hill ahead and we climbed the furrowed clay and from the top looked all around.
We could not make out anything in the green cactus-like cover.
I had believed we might see him from the ant-hill and after we came down we went on for about two hundred yards into the broken cactus.
Once again we heard him cough ahead of us and once, a little farther on, we heard a growl.
It was very deep and very impressive.
Since the ant heap my heart had not been in it.
Until that had failed I had believed I might have a close and good shot and I knew that if I could kill one alone, without Pop along, I would feel good about it for a long time.
I had made up my mind absolutely not to shoot unless I knew I could kill him, I had killed three and knew what it consisted in, but I was getting more excitement from[Pg 141] this one than the whole trip.
I felt it was perfectly fair to Pop to take it on as long as I had a chance to call the shot but what we were getting into now was bad.
He kept moving away as we came on, but slowly.
Evidently he did not want to move, having fed, probably, when we had heard him roaring in the early morning, and he wanted to settle down now.
M’Cola hated it.
How much of it was the responsibility he felt for me to Pop and how much was his own acute feeling of misery about the dangerous game I did not know.
But he felt very miserable.
Finally he put his hand on my shoulder, put his face almost into mine and shook his head violently three times.
‘Hapana! Hapana! Hapana! B’wana!’ he protested, sorrowed, and pleaded.
After all, I had no business taking him where I could not call the shot and it was a profound personal relief to turn back.
‘All right,’ I said.
We turned around and came back out the same way we had gone in, then crossed the open prairie to the trees where P.
was waiting.
‘Did you see him?’.
‘No,’ I told her.
‘We heard him three or four times.
‘Weren’t you frightened?’.
‘Pea-less,’ I said, ‘at the last.
But I’d rather have shot him in there than any damned thing in the world.
‘My, I’m glad you’re back,’ she said.
I got the dictionary out of my pocket and made a sentence in pigeon Swahili.
‘Like’ was the word I wanted.
‘M’Cola like Simba?’.
[Pg 142]M’Cola could grin again now and the smile moved the Chinese hairs at the corner of his mouth.
‘Hapana,’ he said, and waved his hand in front of his face.
‘Hapana!’.
‘Hapana’ is a negative.
‘Shoot a kudu?’ I suggested.
‘Good,’ said M’Cola feelingly in Swahili.
‘Better.
Best.
Tendalla, yes.
Tendalla.
But we never saw a kudu bull out of that camp and we left two days later to go into Babati and then down to Kondoa and strike across country toward Handeni and the coast.
I never liked that camp, nor the guides, nor the country.
It had that picked-over, shot-out feeling.
We knew there were kudu there and the Prince of Wales had killed his kudu from that camp, but there had been three other parties in that season, and the natives were hunting, supposedly defending their crops from baboons, but on meeting a native with a brass-bound musket it seemed odd that he should follow the baboons ten miles away from his shamba up into the kudu hills to have a shot at them, and I was all for pulling out and trying the new country toward Handeni where none of us had ever been.
‘Let’s go then,’ Pop said.
It seemed this new country was a gift.
Kudu came out into the open and you sat and waited for the more enormous ones and selecting a suitable head, blasted him over.
Then there were sable and we agreed that whoever killed the first kudu should move on in the sable country.
[Pg 143] I was beginning to feel awfully good and Karl was very cheerful at the prospect of this new miraculous country where they were so unsophisticated that it was really a shame to topple them over.
We left, soon after daylight, ahead of the outfit, who were to strike camp and follow in the two lorries.
We stopped in Babati at the little hotel overlooking the lake and bought some more Pan-Yan pickles and had some cold beer.
Then we started south on the Cape to Cairo road, here well graded, smooth, and carefully cut through wooded hills overlooking the long yellow stretch of plains of the Masai Steppes, down and through farming country, where the dried-breasted old women and the shrunken-flanked, hollow-ribbed old men hoed in the cornfields, through miles and dusty miles of this, and then into a valley of sun-baked, eroded land where the soil was blowing away in clouds as you looked, into the tree-shaded, pretty, whitewashed, German model-garrison town of Kandoa-Irangi.
We left M’Cola at the crossroads to hold up our lorries when they came, put the car into some shade and visited the military cemetery.
We intended to call on the D.
but they were at lunch, and we did not want to bother them, so after the military cemetery, which was a pleasant, clean, well-kept place and as good as another to be dead in, we had some beer under a tree in shade that seemed liquid cool after the white glare of a sun that you could feel the weight of on your neck and shoulders, started the car and went out to the crossroads to pick up the lorries and head to the east into the new country.
[Pg 144].
CHAPTER SIX.
It was a new country to us but it had the marks of the oldest countries.
The road was a track over shelves of solid rock, worn by the feet of the caravans and the cattle, and it rose in the boulder-strewn un-roadliness through a double line of trees and into the hills.
The country was so much like Aragon that I could not believe that we were not in Spain until, instead of mules with saddle bags, we met a dozen natives bare-legged and bare-headed dressed in white cotton cloth they wore gathered over the shoulder like a toga; but when they had passed, the high trees beside the track over those rocks was Spain and I had followed this same route forged on ahead[Pg 145] and following close behind a horse one time watching the horror of the flies scuttling around his crupper.
They were the same camel flies we found here on the lions.
In Spain if one got inside your shirt you had to get the shirt off to kill him.
He’d go inside the neckband, down the back, around and under one arm, make for the navel and the belly band, and if you did not get him he would move with such intelligence and speed that, scuttling flat and uncrushable he would make you undress completely to kill him.
That day of watching the camel flies working under the horse’s tail, having had them myself, gave me more[Pg 146] horror than anything I could remember except one time in a hospital with my right arm broken off short between the elbow and the shoulder, the back of the hand having hung down against my back, the points of the bone having cut up the flesh of the biceps until it finally rotted, swelled, burst, and sloughed off in pus.
Alone with the pain in the night in the fifth week of not sleeping I thought suddenly how a bull elk must feel if you break a shoulder and he gets away and in that night I lay and felt it all, the whole thing as it would happen from the shock of the bullet to the end of the business and, being a little out of my head, thought perhaps what I was going through was a punishment for all hunters.
Then, getting well, decided if it was a punishment I had paid it and at least I knew what I was doing.
I did nothing that had not been done to me.
I had been shot and I had been crippled and gotten away.
I expected, always, to be killed by one thing or another and I, truly, did not mind that any more.
Since I still loved to hunt I resolved that I would only shoot as long as I could kill cleanly and as soon as I lost that ability I would stop.
If you serve time for society, democracy, and the other things quite young, and declining any further enlistment make yourself responsible only to yourself, you exchange the pleasant, comforting stench of comrades for something you can never feel in any other way than by yourself.
That something I cannot yet define completely but the feeling comes when you write well and truly of something and know impersonally you have written in that way and those who are paid to read it and report on[Pg 147] it do not like the subject so they say it is all a fake, yet you know its value absolutely; or when you do something which people do not consider a serious occupation and yet you know, truly, that it is as important and has always been as important as all the things that are in fashion, and when, on the sea, you are alone with it and know that this Gulf Stream you are living with, knowing, learning about, and loving, has moved, as it moves, since before man, and that it has gone by the shoreline of that long, beautiful, unhappy island since before Columbus sighted it and that the things you find out about it, and those that have always lived in it are permanent and of value because that stream, will flow, as it has flowed, after the Indians, after the Spaniards, after the British, after the Americans and after all the Cubans and all the systems of governments, the richness, the poverty, the martyrdom, the sacrifice and the venality and the cruelty are all gone as the high-piled scow of garbage, bright-coloured, white-flecked; ill-smelling, now tilted on its side, spills off its load into the blue water, turning it a pale green to a depth of four or five fathoms as the load spreads across the surface, the sinkable part going down and the flotsam of palm fronds, corks, bottles, and used electric light globes, seasoned with an occasional condom or a deep floating corset, the torn leaves of a student’s exercise book, a well-inflated dog, the occasional rat, the no-longer-distinguished cat; all this well shepherded by the boats of the garbage pickers who pluck their prizes with long poles, as interested, as intelligent, and as accurate as historians; they have the[Pg 148] viewpoint; the stream, with no visible flow, takes five loads of this a day when things are going well in La Habana and in ten miles along the coast it is as clear and blue and unimpressed as it was ever before the tug hauled out the scow; and the palm fronds of our victories, the worn light bulbs of our discoveries and the empty condoms of our great loves float with no significance against one single, lasting thing—the stream.
So, in the front seat, thinking of the sea and of the country, in a little while we ran out of Aragon and down to the bank of a sand river, half a mile wide, of golden-coloured sand, shored by green trees and broken by islands of timber and in this river the water is underneath the sand and the game comes down at night and digs in the sand with sharp-pointed hoofs and water flows in and they drink.
We cross this river and by now it was getting to be afternoon and we passed many people on the road who were leaving the country ahead where there was a famine and there were small trees and close brush now beside the road, and then it commenced to climb and we came into some blue hills, old, worn, wooded hills with trees like beeches and clusters of huts with fire smoking and cattle home driven, flocks of sheep and goats and patches of corn and I said to P.
, ‘It’s like Galicia’.
‘Exactly,’ she said.
‘We’ve been through three provinces of Spain to-day.
‘Is it really?’ Pop asked.
‘There’s no difference,’ I said.
‘Only the buildings.
It was like Navarre in Droopy’s country too.
The limestone outcropping in the same way, the way[Pg 149] the land lies, the trees along the watercourses and the springs.
‘It’s damned strange how you can love a country,’ Pop said.
‘You two are very profound fellows,’ P.
said.
‘But where are we going to camp?’.
‘Here,’ said Pop.
‘As well as any place.
We’ll just find some water.
We camped under some trees near three big wells where native women came for water and, after drawing lots for location, Karl and I hunted in the dusk around two of the hills across the road above the native village.
‘It’s all kudu country,’ Pop said.
‘You’re liable to jump one anywhere.
But we saw nothing but some Masai cattle in the timber and came home, in the dark, glad of the walk after a day in the car, to find camp up, Pop and P.
in pyjamas by the fire, and Karl not yet in.
He came in, furious for some reason, no kudu possibly, pale, and gaunt looking and speaking to nobody.
Later, at the fire, he asked me where we had gone and I said we had hunted around our hill until our guide had heard them; then cut up to the top of the hill, down, and across country to camp.
‘What do you mean, heard us?’.
‘He said he heard you.
So did M’Cola.
‘I thought we drew lots for where we would hunt.
‘We did,’ I said.
‘But we didn’t know we had gotten around to your side until we heard you.
[Pg 150]‘Did you hear us?’.
‘I heard something,’ I said.
‘And when I put my hand up to my ear to listen the guide said something to M’Cola and M’Cola said, “B’wana”.
I said, “What B’wana?” and he said, “B’wana Kabor”.
That’s you.
So we figured we’d come to our limit and went up to the top and came back.
He said nothing and looked very angry.
‘Don’t get sore about it,’ I said.
‘I’m not sore.
I’m tired,’ he said.
I could believe it because of all people no one can be gentler, more understanding, more self-sacrificing, than Karl, but the kudu had become an obsession to him and he was not himself, nor anything like himself.
‘He better get one pretty quick,’ P.
said when he had gone into his tent to bathe.
‘Did you cut in on his country?’ Pop asked me.
‘Hell, no,’ I said.
‘He’ll get one where we’re going,’ Pop said.
‘He’ll probably get a fifty-incher.
‘All the better,’ I said.
‘But by God, I want to get one too.
‘You will, Old Timer,’ Pop said.
‘I haven’t a thought but what you will.
‘What the hell! We’ve got ten days.
‘We’ll get sable too, you’ll see.
Once our luck starts to run.
‘How long have you ever had them hunt them in a good country?’.
‘Three weeks and leave without seeing one.
And I’ve[Pg 151] had them get them the first half day.
It’s still hunting, the way you hunt a big buck at home.
‘I love it,’ I said.
‘But I don’t want that guy to beat me.
Pop, he’s got the best buff, the best rhino, the best water-buck.
‘You beat him on oryx,’ Pop said.
‘What’s an oryx?’.
‘He’ll look damned handsome when you get him home.
‘I’m just kidding.
‘You beat him on impalla, on eland.
You’ve got a first-rate bushbuck.
Your leopard’s as good as his.
But he’ll beat you on anything where there’s luck.
He’s got damned wonderful luck and he’s a good lad.
I think he’s off his feed a little.
‘You know how fond I am of him.
I like him as well as I like anyone.
But I want to see him have a good time.
It’s no fun to hunt if we get that way about it.
‘You’ll see.
He’ll get a kudu at this next camp and he’ll be on top of the wave.
‘I’m just a crabby bastard,’ I said.
‘Of course you are,’ said Pop.
‘But why not have a drink?’.
‘Right,’ I said.
Karl came out, quiet, friendly, gentle, and understandingly delicate.
‘It will be fine when we get to that new country,’ he said.
‘It will be swell,’ I said.
‘Tell me what it’s like, Mr.
Phillips,’ he said to Pop.
[Pg 152]‘I don’t know,’ said Pop.
‘But they say it’s very pleasant hunting.
They’re supposed to feed right out in the open.
That old Dutchman claims there are some remarkable heads.
‘I hope you get a sixty-incher, kid,’ Karl said to me.
‘You’ll get a sixty-incher.
‘No,’ said Karl.
‘Don’t kid me.
I’ll be happy with any kudu.
‘You’ll probably get a hell of a one,’ Pop said.
‘Don’t kid me,’ Karl said.
‘I know how lucky I’ve been.
I would be happy with any kudu.
Any bull at all.
He was very gentle and he could tell what was in your mind, forgive you for it, and understand it.
‘Good old Karl,’ I said, warmed with whisky, understanding, and sentiment.
‘We’re having a swell time, aren’t we?’ Karl said.
‘Where’s poor old Mama?’.
‘I’m here,’ said P.
from the shadow.
‘I’m one of those quiet people.
‘By God if you’re not,’ Pop said.
‘But you can puncture the old man quick enough when he gets started.
‘That’s what makes a woman a universal favourite,’ P.
told him.
‘Give me another compliment, Mr.
‘By God, you’re brave as a little terrier.
’ Pop and I had both been drinking, it seemed.
‘That’s lovely.
’ P.
sat far back in her chair, holding her hands clasped around her mosquito boots.
I looked at her, seeing her quilted blue robe in the firelight[Pg 153] now, and the light on her black hair.
‘I love it when you all reach the little terrier stage.
Then I know the war can’t be far away.
Were either of you gentlemen in the war by any chance?’.
‘Not me,’ said Pop.
‘Your husband, one of the bravest bastards that ever lived, an extraordinary wing shot and an excellent tracker.
‘Now he’s drunk, we get the truth,’ I said.
‘Let’s eat,’ said P.
‘I’m really frightfully hungry.
We were out in the car at daylight, out on to the road and beyond the village and, passing through a stretch of heavy bush, we came to the edge of a plain, still misty before the sunrise, where we could see, a long way off, eland feeding, looking huge and grey in the early morning light.
We stopped the car at the edge of the bush and getting out and sitting down with the glasses saw there was a herd of kongoni scattered between us and the eland and with the kongoni a single bull oryx, like a fat, plum-coloured, Masai donkey with marvellous long, black, straight, back-slanting horns that showed each time he lifted his head from feeding.
‘You want to go after him?’ I asked Karl.
‘No.
You go on.
I knew he hated to make a stalk and to shoot in front of people and so I said, ‘All right’.
Also I wanted to shoot, selfishly, and Karl was unselfish.
We wanted meat badly.
I walked along the road, not looking toward the game, trying to look casual, holding the rifle slung straight up[Pg 154] and down from the left shoulder away from the game.
They seemed to pay no attention but fed away steadily.
I knew that if I moved toward them they would at once move off out of range so, when from the tail of my eye I saw the oryx drop his head to feed again, and, the shot looking possible, I sat down, slipped my arm through the sling and as he looked up and started to move off, quartering away, I held for the top of his back and squeezed off.
You do not hear the noise of the shot on game but the slap of the bullet sounded as he started running across and to the right, the whole plain back-grounding into moving animals against the rise of the sun, the rocking-horse canter of the long-legged, grotesque kongoni, the heavy swinging trot into gallop of the eland, and another oryx I had not seen before running with the kongoni.
This sudden life and panic all made background for the one I wanted, now trotting, three-quartering away, his horns held high now and I stood to shoot running, got on him, the whole animal miniatured in the aperture and I held above his shoulders, swung ahead and squeezed and he was down, kicking, before the crack of the bullet striking bone came back.
It was a very long and even more lucky shot that broke a hind leg.
I ran toward him, then slowed to walk up carefully, in order not to be blown if he jumped and ran; but he was down for good.
He had gone down so suddenly and the bullet had made such a crack as it landed that I was afraid I had hit him on the horns but when I reached him he was dead from the first shot behind the shoulders[Pg 155] high up in the back and I saw it was cutting the leg from under him that brought him down.
They all came up and Charo stuck him to make him legal meat.
‘Where did you hold on him the second time?’ Karl asked.
‘Nowhere.
A touch above and quite a way ahead and swung with him.
‘It was very pretty,’ Dan said.
‘By evening,’ Pop said, ‘he’ll tell us that he broke that off leg on purpose.
That’s one of his favourite shots, you know.
Did you ever hear him explain it?’.
While M’Cola was skinning the head out and Charo was butchering out the meat, a long, thin Masai with a spear came up, said good morning, and stood, on one leg, watching the skinning.
He spoke to me at some length, and I called to Pop.
The Masai repeated it to Pop.
‘He wants to know if you are going to shoot something else,’ Pop said.
‘He would like some hides but he doesn’t care about oryx hide.
It is almost worthless, he says.
He wonders if you would like to shoot a couple of kongoni or an eland.
He likes those hides.
‘Tell him on our way back.
Pop told him solemnly.
The Masai shook my hand.
‘Tell him he can always find me around Harry’s New York Bar,’ I said.
The Masai said something else and scratched one leg with the other.
‘He says why did you shoot him twice?’ Pop asked.
‘Tell him in the morning in our tribe we always shoot[Pg 156] them twice.
Later in the day we shoot them once.
In the evening we are often half shot ourselves.
Tell him he can always find me at the New Stanley or at Torr’s.
‘He says what do you do with the horns?’.
‘Tell him in our tribe we give the horns to our wealthiest friends.
Tell him it is very exciting and sometimes members of the tribe are chased across vast spaces with empty pistols.
Tell him he can find me in the book.
Pop told the Masai something and we shook hands again, parting on a most excellent basis.
Looking across the plain through the mist we could see some other Masai coming along the road; earth-brown skins, and knee-ing forward stride and spears thin in the morning light.
Back in the car, the oryx head wrapped in a burlap sack, the meat tied inside the mudguards, the blood drying, the meat dusting over, the road of red sand now, the plain gone, the bush again close to the edge of the road, we came up into some hills and through the little village of Kibaya where there was a white rest house and a general store and much farming land.
It was here Dan had sat on a haystack one time waiting for a kudu to feed out into the edge of a patch of mealy-corn and a lion had stalked Dan while he sat and nearly gotten him.
This gave us a strong historical feeling for the village of Kibaya and as it was still cool and the sun had not yet burned off the dew from the grass I suggested we drink a bottle of that silver-paper-necked, yellow-and-black-labelled German beer with the horseman in armour on it in order that we might remember the place better and[Pg 157] even appreciate it more.
This done, full of historical admiration for Kibaya, we learned the road was possible ahead, left word for the lorries to follow on to the eastward and headed on toward the coast and the kudu country.
For a long time, while the sun rose and the day became hot we drove through what Pop had described, when I asked him what the country was like to the south, as a million miles of bloody Africa, bush close to the road that was impenetrable, solid, scrubby-looking undergrowth.
‘There are very big elephant in there,’ Pop said.
‘But it’s impossible to hunt them.
That’s why they’re very big.
Simple, isn’t it?’.
After a long stretch of the million-mile country, the country began to open out into dry, sandy, bush-bordered prairies that dried into a typical desert country with occasional patches of bush where there was water, that Pop said was like the northern frontier province of Kenya.
We watched for gerenuk, that long-necked antelope that resembles a praying mantis in its way of carrying itself, and for the lesser kudu that we knew lived in this desert bush, but the sun was high now and we saw nothing.
Finally the road began to lift gradually into the hills again, low, blue, wooded hills now, with miles of sparse bush, a little thicker than orchard bush, between, and ahead a pair of high, heavy, timbered hills that were big enough to be mountains.
These were on each side of the road and as we climbed in the car where the red road narrowed there was a herd of hundreds of cattle ahead being driven down to the coast by Somali cattle buyers; the principal buyer walked ahead, tall, good-looking in[Pg 158] white turban and coast clothing, carrying an umbrella as a symbol of authority.
We worked the car through the herd, finally, and coming out wound our way through pleasant looking bush, up and out into the open between the two mountains and on, half a mile, to a mud and thatched village in the open clearing on a little low plateau beyond the two mountains.
Looking back, the mountains looked very fine and with timber up their slopes, outcroppings of limestone and open glades and meadows above the timber.
‘Is this the place?’.
‘Yes,’ said Dan.
‘We will find where the camping place is.
A very old, worn, and faded black man, with a stubble of white beard, a farmer, dressed in a dirty once-white cloth gathered at the shoulder in the manner of a Roman toga, came out from behind one of the mud and wattle huts, and guided us back down the road and off it to the left to a very good camp site.
He was a very discouraged-looking old man and after Pop and Dan had talked with him he went off, seeming more discouraged than before, to bring some guides whose names Dan had written on a piece of paper as being recommended by a Dutch hunter who had been here a year ago and who was Dan’s great friend.
We took the seats out of the car to use as a table and benches, and spreading our coats to sit on had a lunch in the deep shade of a big tree, drank some beer, and slept or read while we waited for the lorries to come up.
Before the lorries arrived the old man came back with the[Pg 159] skinniest, hungriest, most unsuccessful looking of Wanderobos who stood on one leg, scratched the back of his neck and carried a bow and quiver of arrows and a spear.
Queried as to whether this was the guide whose name we had, the old man admitted he was not and went off more discouraged than ever, to get the official guides.
When we woke next the old man was standing with the two official and highly-clothed-in-khaki guides and two others, quite naked, from the village.
There was a long palaver and the head one of the two khaki-panted guides showed his credentials, a To Whom It May Concern, stating the bearer knew the country well and was a reliable boy and capable tracker.
This was signed by so and so, professional hunter.
The khaki-clothed guide referred to this professional hunter as B’wana Simba and the name infuriated us all.
‘Some bloke that killed a lion once,’ Pop said.
‘Tell him I am B’wana Fisi, the hyena slaughterer,’ I told Dan.
‘B’wana Fisi chokes them with his naked hands.
Dan was telling them something else.
‘Ask them if they would like to meet B’wana Hop-Toad, the inventor of the hoptoads and Mama Tziggi, who owns all these locusts.
Dan ignored this.
It seemed they were discussing money.
After ascertaining their customary daily wage, Pop told them if either of us killed a kudu the guide would receive fifteen shillings.
‘You mean a pound,’ said the leading guide.
‘They seem to know what they’re up to,’ Pop said.
‘I[Pg 160] must say I don’t care for this sportsman in spite of what B’wana Simba says.
B’wana Simba, by the way, we later found out to be an excellent hunter with a wonderful reputation on the coast.
‘We’ll put them into two lots and you draw from them,’ Pop suggested, ‘one naked one and one with breeches in each lot.
I’m all for the naked savage, myself, as a guide.
On suggesting to the two testimonial-equipped, breeched guides that they select an unclothed partner, we found this would not work out.
Loud Mouth, the financial and, now, theatrical, genius who was giving a gesture-by-gesture reproduction of How B’wana Simba Killed His Last Kudu interrupted it long enough to state he would only hunt with Abdullah.
Abdullah, the short, thick-nosed, educated one, was His Tracker.
They always hunted together.
He himself did not track.
He resumed the pantomime of B’wana Simba and another character known as B’wana Doktor and the horned beasts.
‘We’ll take the two savages as one lot and these two Oxonians as the other,’ Pop said.
‘I hate that theatrical bastard,’ I said.
‘He may be marvellous,’ Pop said doubtfully.
Anyway, you’re a tracker, you know.
The old man says the other two are good.
‘Thank you.
Go to hell.
Will you hold the straws?’.
Pop arranged two grass stems in his fist.
‘The long one is for David Garrick and his pal,’ he explained.
‘The short one is the two nudist sportsmen.
‘Do you want to draw first?’.
[Pg 161]‘Go ahead,’ Karl said.
I drew David Garrick and Abdullah.
‘I got the bloody tragedian.
‘He may be very good,’ Karl said.
‘Do you want to trade?’.
‘No.
He may be a marvel.
‘Now we’ll draw for choice of beats.
The long straw gets first choice,’ Pop explained.
‘Go ahead and draw.
Karl drew the short one.
‘What are the beats?’ I asked Pop.
There was a long conversation in which our David simulated the killing of half a dozen kudu from different types of ambush, surprise, stalks in the open, and jumping them in the bush.
Finally Pop said, ‘It seems there’s some sort of a salt-lick where they come to lick salt and thousands are slain.
Then sometimes you just stroll around the hill there and pot the poor beggars in the open.
If you’re feeling frightfully fit, you climb for them and up in the crags you knock them over as they stroll out to feed.
‘I’ll take the salt-lick.
‘Mind you only shoot the very biggest sort,’ Pop said.
‘When do we start?’ Karl asked.
‘The salt-lick is supposed to be an early morning-show,’ Pop told us.
‘But Old Hem might as well have a look at it to-night.
It’s about five miles down the road before you start to walk.
He’ll start first and take the car.
You can start back in the hills any time after the sun gets a little farther down.
[Pg 162]‘What about the Memsahib?’ I asked.
‘Should she go with me?’.
‘I don’t think it’s advisable,’ Pop said seriously.
‘The fewer people when you’re after kudu the better.
M’Cola, Theatre Business, Abdullah, and I came back that evening late in the cool of the night and full of excitement as we came up to the fire.
The dust of the salt-lick had been cut up and printed deep with fresh kudu tracks and there were several big bull tracks.
The blind made a marvellous ambush and I was as confident and as sure of a shot at kudu the next morning as I would be sure of a shot at ducks from a good blind, with a fine stock of decoys out, cold weather, and the certainty of a flight on.
‘It’s airtight.
It’s foolproof.
It’s even a shame.
What’s his name, Booth, Barrett, McCullough—you know who I mean.
‘Charles Laughton,’ said Pop, pulling on his pipe.
‘That’s the one.
Fred Astaire.
Society’s hoofer and the world’s.
He’s an ace.
Found the blind and everything.
Knew where the salt-lick was.
Could tell which way the wind blew by simply scattering dust.
He’s a marvel.
B’wana Simba trains ‘em, pal.
Pop, we have them in the container.
It’s only a question of not spoiling the meat and selecting the more rugged specimens.
I’ll kill you two to-morrow on that lick.
Citizens, I feel very well.
‘What have you been drinking?’.
‘Not a damned thing, really.
Call Garrick.
Tell him I’ll put him in the cinema.
Got a part for him.
Little[Pg 163] thing I thought up on the way home.
It may not work out but I like the plot.
Othello or The Moor of Venice.
D’you like it? It’s got a wonderful idea.
You see this jig we call Othello falls in love with this girl who’s never been around at all so we call her Desdemona.
Like it? They’ve been after me to write it for years but I drew the colour line.
Let him go out and get a reputation, I told them.
Harry Wills, hell.
Paulino beat him.
Sharkey beat him.
Dempsey beat Sharkey.
Carnera knocked him out.
What if nobody saw the punch? Where the hell were we, Pop? Harry Greb is dead you know.
‘We were just coming into Town,’ Pop said.
‘Chaps were throwing things at you and we couldn’t find out why.
‘I remember,’ P.
said.
‘Why didn’t you make him draw the colour line, Mr.
‘I was frightfully tired,’ Pop said.
‘You’re very distinguished looking, though,’ P.
said.
‘What are we going to do with this goofy?’.
‘Throw a drink into the brute and see if he’ll quiet down.
‘I’m quiet now,’ I said.
‘But, by God, I feel awfully good about to-morrow.
Just then who should come into camp but old Karl with his two naked savages and his half-size, very devout Mohammedan gun bearer, Charo.
In the firelight old Karl looked a greyish, yellowish white in the face and he took off his Stetson.
‘Well, did you get one?’ he asked.
‘No.
But they’re there.
What did you do?’.
[Pg 164]‘Walked along a goddamned road.
How do they expect to find kudu along a road with nothing but cattle and huts and people?’.
He did not look like himself and I thought he must be ill.
But coming in like a death’s head when we had been clowning made me behave badly again and I said, ‘We drew lots, you know’.
‘Of course,’ he said bitterly.
‘We hunted along a road.
What would you expect to see? Does that seem the way to hunt kudu to you?’.
‘But you’ll get one on the salt-lick in the morning,’ P.
told him very cheerfully.
I drank off the glass of whisky and soda and heard my voice say very cheerfully, ‘You’ll be sure to get one on the salt-lick in the morning’.
‘You’re hunting it in the morning,’ Karl said.
‘No.
You’re hunting it.
I had it to-night.
We’re changing off.
That’s been understood.
Isn’t it, Pop?’.
‘Quite,’ Pop said.
No one was looking at anyone else.
‘Have a whisky and soda, Karl,’ P.
said.
‘All right,’ Karl said.
We had one of those quiet meals.
In bed in the tent, I said, ‘What in God’s name prompted you to say that about him having the lick in the morning?’.
‘I don’t know.
I don’t think that’s what I meant to say.
I got mixed up.
Let’s not talk about it.
‘I won the damned thing drawing lots.
You can’t go against lots.
That’s the only way the luck has a chance to even up, ever.
‘Don’t let’s talk about it.
[Pg 165]‘I don’t think he’s well now and he doesn’t feel himself.
The damned things have gotten his goat and he’s liable to blow that salt-lick higher than a kite in the state he’s in.
‘Please stop talking about it.
‘I will.
‘Good.
‘Well, we made him feel good anyway.
‘I don’t know that we did.
Please stop talking about it.
‘I will.
‘Good.
‘Good night,’ she said.
‘The hell with it,’ I said.
‘Good night.
‘Good night.
[Pg 166].
CHAPTER SEVEN.
In the morning Karl and his outfit started for the salt-lick and Garrick, Abdullah, M’Cola and I crossed the road, angled behind the village up a dry watercourse and started climbing the mountains in a mist.
We headed up a pebbly, boulder-filled, dry stream bed overgrown with vines and brush so that, climbing, you walked, stooping, in a steep tunnel of vines and foliage.
I sweated so that I was soaked through my shirt and undergarments and when we came out on the shoulder of the mountain and stood, looking down at the bank of clouds quilting over the entire valley below us, the morning breeze chilled me and I had to put on my raincoat while we glassed the[Pg 167] country.
I was too wet with sweat to sit down and I signed Garrick to keep on going.
We went around one side of the mountain, doubled back on a higher grade and crossed over, out of the sun that was drying my wet shirt and along the top of a series of grassy valleys, stopping to search each one thoroughly with the field glasses.
Finally we came to a sort of amphitheatre, a bowl-like valley of very green grass with a small stream down the middle and timber along the far side and all the lower edge.
We sat in the shadow against some rocks, out of any breeze, watching with the glasses as the sun rose and lighted the opposite slopes, seeing two kudu[Pg 168] cows and a calf feed out from the timber, moving with the quickly browsing, then head lifted, long-staring vigilance of all browsing animals in a forest.
Animals on a plain can see so far that they have confidence and feed very differently from animals in the woods.
We could see the vertical white stripes on their grey flanks and it was very satisfying to watch them and to be high in the mountain that early in the morning.
Then, while we watched, there was a boom, like a rockslide.
I thought at first it was a boulder falling, but M’Cola whispered.
‘B’wana Kibor! Piga!’ We listened for another shot but we did not hear one and I was sure Karl had his kudu.
The cows we were watching had heard the shot and stood, listening, then went on feeding.
But they fed into the timber.
I remembered the old saying of the Indian in camp, ‘One shot, meat.
Two shots, maybe.
Three shots, heap s—t,’ and I got out the dictionary to translate it for M’Cola.
However it came out seemed to amuse him and he laughed and shook his head.
We glassed that valley until the sun came on to us, then hunted around the other side of the mountain and in another fine valley saw the place where the other B’wana, B’wana Doktor he still sounded like, had shot a fine bull kudu, but a Masai walked down the centre of the valley while we were glassing it and when I pretended I was going to shoot him Garrick became very dramatic insisting it was a man, a man, a man!.
‘Don’t shoot men?’ I asked him.
‘No! No! No!’ he said putting his hand to his head.
I took the gun down with great reluctance, clowning for[Pg 169] M’Cola who was grinning, and it very hot now, we walked across a meadow where the grass was knee high and truly swarming with long, rose-coloured, gauze-winged locusts that rose in clouds about us, making a whirring like a mowing machine, and climbing small hills and going down a long steep slope, we made our way back to camp to find the air of the valley drifting with flying locusts and Karl already in camp with his kudu.
Passing the skinner’s tent he showed me the head which looked, body-less and neck-less, the cape of hide hanging loose, wet and heavy from where the base of the skull had been severed from the vertebral column, a very strange and unfortunate kudu.
Only the skin running from the eyes down to the nostrils, smooth grey and delicately marked with white, and the big, graceful ears were beautiful.
The eyes were already dusty and there were flies around them and the horns were heavy, coarse, and instead of spiralling high they made a heavy turn and slanted straight out.
It was a freak head, heavy and ugly.
Pop was sitting under the dining tent smoking and reading.
‘Where’s Karl?’ I asked him.
‘In his tent, I think.
What did you do?’.
‘Worked around the hill.
Saw a couple of cows.
‘I’m awfully glad you got him,’ I told Karl at the mouth of his tent.
‘How was it?’.
‘We were in the blind and they motioned me to keep my head down and then when I looked up there he was right beside us.
He looked huge.
‘We heard you shoot.
Where did you hit him?’.
[Pg 170]‘In the leg first, I think.
Then we trailed him and finally I hit him a couple of more times and we got him.
‘I heard only one shot.
‘There were three or four,’ Karl said.
‘I guess the mountain shut off some if you were gone the other way trailing him.
He’s got a heavy beam and a big spread.
‘Thanks,’ Karl said.
‘I hope you get a lot better one.
They said there was another one but I didn’t see him.
I went back to the dining tent where Pop and P.
were.
They did not seem very elated about the kudu.
‘What’s the matter with you?’ I asked.
‘Did you see the head?’ P.
asked.
‘Sure.
‘It’s awful looking,’ she said.
‘It’s a kudu.
He’s got another one still to go.
‘Charo and the trackers said there was another bull with this one.
A big bull with a wonderful head.
‘That’s all right.
I’ll shoot him.
‘If he ever comes back.
‘It’s fine he has one,’ P.
said.
‘I’ll bet he’ll get the biggest one ever known, now,’ I said.
‘I’m sending him down with Dan to the sable country,’ Pop said.
‘That was the agreement.
The first to kill a kudu to get first crack at the sable.
‘That’s fine.
‘Then as soon as you get your kudu we’ll move down there too.
‘Good.
[Pg 171].
PART III.
PURSUIT AND FAILURE.
[Pg 172].
CHAPTER ONE.
That all seemed a year ago.
Now, this afternoon in the car, on the way out to the twenty-eight-mile salt-lick, the sun on our faces, just having shot the guinea fowl, having, in the last five days, failed on the lick where Karl shot his bull, having failed in the hills, the big hills and the small hills, having failed on the flats, losing a shot the night before on this lick because of the Austrian’s lorry, I knew there were only two days more to hunt before we must leave.
M’Cola knew it too, and we were hunting together now, with no feeling of superiority on either side any more, only a shortness of time and our disgust that we did not know the country and were saddled with these farcical bastards as guides.
[Pg 173]Kamau, the driver, was a Kikuyu, a quiet man of about thirty-five who, with an old brown tweed coat some shooter had discarded, trousers heavily patched on the knees and ripped open again, and a very ragged shirt, managed always to give an impression of great elegance.
Kamau was very modest, quiet, and an excellent driver, and now, as we came out of the bush country and into an open, scrubby, desert-looking stretch, I looked at him, whose elegance, achieved with an old coat and a safety pin, whose modesty, pleasantness and skill I admired so much now, and thought how, when we first were out, he had very nearly died of fever, and that if he had died it would have meant nothing to me except that we would[Pg 174] be short a driver; while now whenever or wherever he should die I would feel badly.
Then abandoning the sweet sentiment of the distant and improbable death of Kamau, I thought what a pleasure it would be to shoot David Garrick in the behind, just to see the look on his face, sometime when he was dramatizing a stalk, and, just then, we put up another flock of guineas.
M’Cola handed me the shotgun and I shook my head.
He nodded violently and said, ‘Good.
Very Good’, and I told Kamau to go on.
This confused Garrick who began an oration.
Didn’t we want guineas? Those were guineas.
The finest kind.
I had seen by the speedometer that we were only about three miles from the salt and had no desire to spook a bull off of it, by a shot, to frighten him in the way we had seen the lesser kudu leave the salt when he heard the lorry noise while we were in the blind.
We left the lorry under some scrubby trees about two miles from the lick and walked along the sandy road towards the first salt place which was in the open to the left of the trail.
We had gone about a mile keeping absolutely quiet and walking in single file, Abdullah the educated tracker leading, then me, M’Cola, and Garrick, when we saw the road was wet ahead of us.
Where the sand was thin over the clay there was a pool of water and you could see that a heavy rain had drenched it all on ahead.
I did not realize what this meant but Garrick threw his arms wide, looked up to the sky and bared his teeth in anger.
‘It’s no good,’ M’Cola whispered.
Garrick started to talk in a loud voice.
[Pg 175]‘Shut up, you bastard,’ I said, and put my hand to my mouth.
He kept on talking in above normal tones and I looked up ‘shut up’ in the dictionary while he pointed to the sky and the rained-out road.
I couldn’t find ‘shut up’ so I put the back of my hand against his mouth with some firmness and he closed it in surprise.
‘’Cola,’ I said.
‘Yes,’ said M’Cola.
‘What’s the matter?’.
‘Salt no good.
‘Ah.
So that was it.
I had thought of the rain only as something that made tracking easy.
‘When the rain?’ I asked.
‘Last night,’ M’Cola said.
Garrick started to talk and I placed the back of my hand against his mouth.
‘’Cola.
‘Yes.
‘Other salt,’ pointing in the direction of the big lick in the woods, which I knew was a good bit higher because we went very slightly up hill through the brush to reach it.
‘Other salt good?’.
‘Maybe.
M’Cola said something in a very low voice to Garrick who seemed deeply hurt but kept his mouth shut and we went on down the road, walking around the wet places, to where, sure enough, the deep depression of the salt-lick was half filled with water.
Garrick started to whisper a speech here but M’Cola shut him up again.
[Pg 176]‘Come on,’ I said, and, M’Cola ahead, we started trailing up the damp, sandy, ordinarily dry watercourse that led through the trees to the upper lick.
M’Cola stopped dead, leaned over to look at the damp sand, then whispered, ‘Man’, to me.
There was the track.
‘Shenzi,’ he said, which meant a wild man.
We trailed the man, moving slowly through the trees and stalking the lick carefully, up and into the blind.
M’Cola shook his head.
‘No good,’ he said.
‘Come on.
We went over to the lick.
There it was all written plainly.
There were the tracks of three big bull kudu in the moist bank beyond the lick where they had come to the salt.
Then there were the sudden, deep, knifely-cut tracks where they made a spring when the bow twanged and the slashing heavily cut prints of their hoofs as they had gone off up the bank and then, far-spaced, the tracks running into the bush.
We trailed them, all three, but no man’s track joined theirs.
The bow-man missed them.
M’Cola said, ‘Shenzi!’ putting great hate into the word.
We picked up the shenzi’s tracks and saw where he had gone on back to the road.
We settled down in the blind and waited there until it was dark and a light rain began to fall.
Nothing came to the salt.
In the rain we made our way back to the lorry.
Some wild-man had shot at our kudu and spooked them away from the salt and now the lick was being ruined.
Kamau had rigged a tent out of a big canvas ground[Pg 177] cloth, hung my mosquito net inside, and set up the canvas cot.
M’Cola brought the food inside the shelter tent.
Garrick and Abdullah built a fire and they, Kamau and M’Cola cooked over it.
They were going to sleep in the lorry.
It rained drizzlingly and I undressed, got into mosquito boots and heavy pyjamas and sat on the cot, ate a breast of roast guinea hen and drank a couple of tin cups of half whisky and water.
M’Cola came in, grave, solicitous, and very awkward inside a tent and took my clothes out from where I had folded them to make a pillow and folded them again, very un-neatly, and put them under the blankets.
He brought three tins to see if I did not want them opened.
‘No.
‘Chai?’ he asked.
‘The hell with it.
‘No chai?’.
‘Whisky better.
‘Yes,’ he said feelingly.
‘Yes.
‘Chai in the morning.
Before the sun.
‘Yes, B’wana M’Kumba.
‘You sleep here.
Out of the rain.
’ I pointed to the canvas where the rain was making the finest sound that we, who live much outside of houses, ever hear.
It was a lovely sound, even though it was bitching us.
‘Yes.
‘Go on.
Eat.
‘Yes.
No chai?’.
‘The hell with tea.
‘Whisky?’ he asked hopefully.
[Pg 178]‘Whisky finish.
‘Whisky,’ he said confidently.
‘All right,’ I said.
‘Go eat,’ and pouring the cup half and half with water got in under the mosquito bar, found my clothes and again made them into a pillow, and lying on my side drank the whisky very slowly, resting on one elbow, then dropped the cup down under the bar on to the ground, felt under the cot for the Springfield, put the searchlight beside me in the bed under the blanket, and went to sleep listening to the rain.
I woke when I heard M’Cola come in, make his bed and go to sleep, and I woke once in the night and heard him sleeping by me; but in the morning he was up and had made the tea before I was awake.
‘Chai,’ he said, pulling on my blanket.
‘Bloody chai,’ I said, sitting up still asleep.
It was a grey, wet morning.
The rain had stopped but the mist hung over the ground and we found the salt-lick rained out and not a track near it.
Then we hunted through the wet scrub on the flat hoping to find a track in the soaked earth and trail a bull until we could see him.
There were no tracks.
We crossed the road and followed the edge of the scrub around a moor-like open stretch.
I hoped we might find the rhino but while we came on much fresh rhino dung there were no tracks since the rain.
Once we heard tick birds and looking up saw them in jerky flight above us headed to the northward over the heavy scrub.
We made a long circle through there but found nothing but a fresh hyena track and a cow kudu track.
In a tree M’Cola pointed out a lesser[Pg 179] kudu skull with one beautiful, long, curling horn.
We found the other horn below in the grass and I screwed it back on to its bone base.
‘Shenzi,’ M’Cola said and imitated a man pulling a bow.
The skull was quite clean but the hollow horns had some damp residue in them, smelled unbearably foul and, giving no sign of having noticed the stench, I handed them to Garrick who promptly, without sign gave them to Abdullah.
Abdullah wrinkled the edge of his flat nose and shook his head.
They really smelled abominably.
M’Cola and I grinned and Garrick looked virtuous.
I decided a good idea might be to drive along the road in the car, watching for kudu, and hunt any likely-looking clearings.
We went back to the car and did this, working several clearings with no luck.
By then the sun was up and the road was becoming populous with travellers, both white-clothed and naked, and we decided to head for camp.
On our way in, we stopped and stalked the other salt-lick.
There was an impalla on it looking very red where the sun struck his hide in the patches between the grey trees and there were many kudu tracks.
We smoothed them over and drove on into camp to find a sky full of locusts passing over, going to the westward, making the sky, as you looked up, seem a pink dither of flickering passage, flickering like an old cinema film, but pink instead of grey.
and Pop came out and were very disappointed.
No rain had fallen in camp and they had been sure we would have something when we came in.
‘Did my literary pal get off?’.
[Pg 180]‘Yes,’ Pop said.
‘He’s gone into Handeni.
‘He told me all about American women,’ P.
said.
‘Poor old Poppa, I was sure you’d get one.
Damn the rain.
‘How are American women?’.
‘He thinks they’re terrible.
‘Very sound fellow,’ said Pop.
‘Tell me just what happened to-day.
We sat in the shade of the dining tent and I told them.
‘A Wanderobo,’ Pop said.
‘They’re frightful shots.
Bad luck.
‘I thought it might be one of those travelling sportsmen you see with their bows slung going along the road.
He saw the lick by the road and trailed up to the other one.
‘Not very likely.
They carry those bows and arrows as protection.
They’re not hunters.
‘Well, whoever it was put it on us.
‘Bad luck.
That, and the rain.
I’ve had scouts out here on both the hills but they’ve seen nothing.
‘Well, we’re not bitched until to-morrow night.
When do we have to leave?’.
‘After to-morrow.
‘That bloody savage.
‘I suppose Karl is blasting up the sable down there.
‘We won’t be able to get into camp for the horns.
Have you heard anything?’.
‘No.
‘I’m going to give up smoking for six months for you to get one,’ P.
said.
‘I’ve started already.
[Pg 181]We had lunch and afterwards I went into the tent and lay down and read.
I knew we still had a chance on the lick in the morning and I was not going to worry about it.
But I was worried and I did not want to go to sleep and wake up feeling dopey so I came out and sat in one of the canvas chairs under the open dining tent and read somebody’s life of Charles the Second and looked up every once in a while to watch the locusts.
The locusts were exciting to see and it was difficult for me to take them as a matter of course.
Finally I went to sleep in the chair with my feet on a chop-box and when I woke there was Garrick, the bastard, wearing a large, very floppy, black and white ostrich-plume head-dress.
‘Go away,’ I said in English.
He stood smirking proudly, then turned so I could see the head-dress from the side.
I saw Pop coming out of his tent with a pipe in his mouth.
‘Look what we have,’ I called to him.
He looked, said, ‘Christ’, and went back into the tent.
‘Come on,’ I said.
‘We’ll just ignore it.
Pop came out, finally, with a book and we took no notice of Garrick’s head-dress at all, sitting and talking, while he posed with it.
‘Bastard’s been drinking, too,’ I said.
‘Probably.
‘I can smell it.
Pop, without looking at him, spoke a few words to Garrick in a very soft voice.
‘What did you tell him?’.
[Pg 182]‘To go and get dressed properly and be ready to start.
Garrick walked off, his plumes waving.
‘Not the moment for his ostrich plumes,’ Pop said.
‘Some people probably like them.
‘That’s it.
Start photographing them.
‘Awful,’ I said.
‘Frightful,’ Pop agreed.
‘On the last day if we don’t get anything, I’m going to shoot Garrick in the behind.
What would that cost me?’.
‘Might make lots of trouble.
If you shoot one, you have to shoot the other, too.
‘Only Garrick.
‘Better not shoot then.
Remember it’s me you get into trouble.
‘Joking, Pop.
Garrick, un-head-dressed and with Abdullah, appeared and Pop spoke with them.
‘They want to hunt around the hill a new way.
‘Splendid.
When?’.
‘Any time now.
It looks like rain.
You might get going.
I sent Molo for my boots and a raincoat, M’Cola came out with the Springfield; and we walked down to the car.
It had been heavily cloudy all day although the sun had come through the clouds in the forenoon for a time and again at noon.
The rains were moving up on us.
Now it was starting to rain and the locusts were no longer flying.
[Pg 183]‘I’m dopey with sleep,’ I told Pop.
‘I’m going to have a drink.
We were standing under the big tree by the cooking fire with the light rain pattering in the leaves.
M’Cola brought the whisky flask and handed it to me very solemnly.
‘Have one?’.
‘I don’t see what harm it can do.
We both drank and Pop said, ‘The hell with them.
‘The hell with them.
‘You may find some tracks.
‘We’ll run them out of the country.
In the car we turned to the right on the road, drove on up past the mud village and turned off the road to the left on to a red, hard, clay track that circled the edge of the hills and was close bordered on either side with trees.
It was raining fairly hard now and we drove slowly.
There seemed to be enough sand in the clay to keep the car from slipping.
Suddenly, from the back seat, Abdullah, very excited, told Kamau to stop.
We stopped with a skid, all got out, and walked back.
There was a freshly cut kudu track in the wet clay.
It could not have been made more than five minutes before as it was sharp-edged and the dirt, that had been picked up by the inside of the hoof, was not yet softened by the rain.
‘Doumi,’ Garrick said and threw back his head and spread his arms wide to show horns that hung back over his withers.
‘Kubwa Sana!’ Abdullah agreed it was a bull; a huge bull.
‘Come on,’ I said.
[Pg 184]It was easy tracking and we knew we were close.
In rain or snow it is much easier to come up close to animals and I was sure we were going to get a shot.
We followed the tracks through thick brush and then out into an open patch.
I stopped to wipe the rain off my glasses and blew through the aperture in the rear sight of the Springfield.
It was raining hard now, and I pulled my hat low down over my eyes to keep my glasses dry.
We skirted the edge of the open patch and then, ahead, there was a crash and I saw a grey, white-striped animal making off through the brush.
I threw the gun up and M’Cola grabbed my arm, ‘Manamouki!’ he whispered.
It was a cow kudu.
But when we came up to where it had jumped there were no other tracks.
The same tracks we had followed led, logically and with no possibility of doubt, from the road to that cow.
‘Doumi Kubwa Sana!’ I said, full of sarcasm and disgust to Garrick and made a gesture of giant horns flowing back from behind his ears.
‘Manamouki Kubwa Sana,’ he said very sorrowfully and patiently.
‘What an enormous cow.
‘You lousy ostrich-plumed punk,’ I told him in English.
‘Manamouki! Manamouki! Manamouki!’.
‘Manamouki,’ said M’Cola and nodded his head.
I got out the dictionary, couldn’t find the words, and made it clear to M’Cola with signs that we would circle back in a long swing to the road and see if we could find another track.
We circled back in the rain, getting thoroughly soaked, saw nothing, found the car, and as the rain lessened and the roads still seemed firm decided[Pg 185] to go on until it was dark.
Puffs of cloud hung on the hillside after the rain and the trees dripped but we saw nothing.
Not in the open glades, not in the fields where the bush thinned, not on the green hillsides.
Finally it was dark and we went back to camp.
The Springfield was very wet when we got out of the car and I told M’Cola to clean it carefully and oil it well.
He said he would and I went on and into the tent where a lantern was burning, took off my clothes, had a bath in the canvas tub and came out to the fire comfortable and relaxed in pyjamas, dressing-gown and mosquito boots.
and Pop were sitting in their chairs by the fire and P.
got up to make me a whisky and soda.
‘M’Cola told me,’ Pop said from his chair by the fire.
‘A damned big cow,’ I told him.
‘I nearly busted her.
What do you think about the morning?’.
‘The lick I suppose.
We’ve scouts out to watch both of these hills.
You remember that old man from the village? He’s on a wild-goose chase after them in some country over beyond the hills.
He and the Wanderobo.
They’ve been gone three days.
‘There’s no reason why we shouldn’t get one on the lick where Karl shot his.
One day is as good as another.
‘Quite.
‘It’s the last damned day though and the lick may be rained out.
As soon as it’s wet there’s no salt.
Just mud.
‘That’s it.
‘I’d like to see one.
‘When you do, take your time and make sure of him.
Take your time and kill him.
[Pg 186]‘I don’t worry about that.
‘Let’s talk about something else,’ P.
said.
‘This makes me too nervous.
‘I wish we had old Leather Pants,’ Pop said.
‘God, he was a talker.
He made the old man here talk too.
Give us that spiel on modern writers again.
‘Go to hell.
‘Why don’t we have some intellectual life?’ P.
asked.
‘Why don’t you men ever discuss world topics? Why am I kept in ignorance of everything that goes on?’.
‘World’s in a hell of a shape,’ Pop stated.
‘Awful.
‘What’s going on in America?’.
‘Damned if I know! Some sort of Y.
show.
Starry eyed bastards spending money that somebody will have to pay.
Everybody in our town quit work to go on relief.
Fishermen all turned carpenters.
Reverse of the Bible.
‘How are things in Turkey?’.
‘Frightful.
Took the fezzes away.
Hanged any amount of old pals.
Ismet’s still around though.
‘Been in France lately?’.
‘Didn’t like it.
Gloomy as hell.
Been a bad show there just now.
‘By God,’ said Pop, ‘it must have been if you can believe the papers.
‘When they riot they really riot.
Hell, they’ve got a tradition.
‘Were you in Spain for the revolution?’.
[Pg 187]‘I got there late.
Then we waited for two that didn’t come.
Then we missed another.
‘Did you see the one in Cuba?’.
‘From the start.
‘How was it?’.
‘Beautiful.
Then lousy.
You couldn’t believe how lousy.
‘Stop it,’ P.
said.
‘I know about those things.
I was crouched down behind a marble-topped table while they were shooting in Havana.
They came by in cars shooting at everybody they saw.
I took my drink with me and I was very proud not to have spilled it or forgotten it.
The children said, "Mother, can we go out in the afternoon to see the shooting?" They got so worked up about revolution we had to stop mentioning it.
Bumby got so bloodthirsty about Mr.
he had terrible dreams.
‘Extraordinary,’ Pop said.
‘Don’t make fun of me.
I don’t want to just hear about revolutions.
All we see or hear is revolutions.
I’m sick of them.
‘The old man must like them.
‘I’m sick of them.
‘You know, I’ve never seen one,’ Pop said.
‘They’re beautiful.
Really.
For quite a while.
Then they go bad.
‘They’re very exciting,’ P.
said.
‘I’ll admit that.
But I’m sick of them.
Really, I don’t care anything about them.
‘I’ve been studying them a little.
[Pg 188]‘What did you find out?’ Pop asked.
‘They were all very different but there were some things you could co-ordinate.
I’m going to try to write a study of them.
‘It could be damned interesting.
‘If you have enough material.
You need an awful lot of past performances.
It’s very hard to get anything true on anything you haven’t seen yourself because the ones that fail have such a bad press and the winners always lie so.
Then you can only really follow anything in places where you speak the language.
That limits you of course.
That’s why I would never go to Russia.
When you can’t overhear it’s no good.
All you get are handouts and sight-seeing.
Any one who knows a foreign language in any country is damned liable to lie to you.
You get your good dope always from the people and when you can’t talk with people and can’t overhear you don’t get anything that’s of anything but journalistic value.
‘You want to knuckle down on your Swahili then.
‘I’m trying to.
‘Even then you can’t overhear because they’re always talking their own language.
‘But if I ever write anything about this it will just be landscape painting until I know something about it.
Your first seeing of a country is a very valuable one.
Probably more valuable to yourself than to anyone else, is the hell of it.
But you ought to always write it to try to get it stated.
No matter what you do with it.
‘Most of the damned Safari books are most awful bloody bores.
[Pg 189]‘They’re terrible.
‘The only one I ever liked was Streeter’s.
What did he call it? Denatured Africa.
He made you feel what it was like.
That’s the best.
‘I liked Charlie Curtis’s.
It was very honest and it made a fine picture.
‘That man Streeter was damned funny though.
Do you remember when he shot the kongoni?’.
‘It was very funny.
‘I’ve never read anything, though, that could make you feel about the country the way we feel about it.
They all have Nairobi fast life or else rot about shooting beasts with horns half an inch longer than someone else shot.
Or muck about danger.
‘I’d like to try to write something about the country and the animals and what it’s like to someone who knows nothing about it.
‘Have a try at it.
Can’t do any harm.
You know I wrote a diary of that Alaskan trip.
‘I’d love to read it,’ P.
said.
‘I didn’t know you were a writer, Mr.
‘No bloody fear,’ said Pop.
‘If you’d read it, though, I’ll send for it.
You know it’s just what we did each day and how Alaska looked to an Englishman from Africa.
It’d bore you.
‘Not if you wrote it,’ P.
said.
‘Little woman’s giving us compliments,’ Pop said.
‘Not me.
You.
‘I’ve read things by him,’ she said.
‘I want to read what Mr.
writes.
[Pg 190]‘Is the old man really a writer?’ Pop asked her.
‘I haven’t seen anything to prove it.
You’re sure he doesn’t support you by tracking and wing shooting?’.
‘Oh, yes.
He writes.
When he’s going well he’s awfully easy to get along with.
But just before he gets going he’s frightful.
His temper has to go bad before he can write.
When he talks about never writing again I know he’s about to get started.
‘We ought to get more literary conversation from him,’ Pop said.
‘Leather Breeches was the lad.
Give us some literary anecdotes.
‘Well, the last night we were in Paris I’d been out shooting at Ben Gallagher’s in the Sologne the day before and he had a fermée, you know, they put up a low fence while they’re out feeding, and shot rabbits in the morning and in the afternoon we had several drives and shot pheasants and I shot a chevreuil.
‘That isn’t literary.
‘Wait.
The last night Joyce and his wife came to dinner and we had a pheasant and a quarter of the chevreuil with the saddle and Joyce and I got drunk because we were off for Africa the next day.
God, we had a night.
‘That’s a hell of a literary anecdote,’ Pop said.
‘Who’s Joyce?’.
‘Wonderful guy,’ I said.
‘Wrote Ulysses.
‘Homer wrote Ulysses,’ Pop said.
‘Who wrote Æschylus?’.
‘Homer,’ said Pop.
‘Don’t try to trap me.
D’you know many more literary anecdotes?’.
[Pg 191]‘Ever heard of Pound?’.
‘No,’ said Pop.
‘Absolutely no.
‘I know some good ones about Pound.
‘Suppose you and he ate some funny-sounding beast and then got drunk.
‘Several times,’ I said.
‘Literary life must be awfully jolly.
Think I’d make a writer?’.
‘Rather.
‘We’re going to chuck all this,’ Pop told P.
, ‘and both be writers.
Give us another anecdote.
‘Ever heard of George Moore?’.
‘Chap that wrote "But before I go, George Moore, here’s a last long health to you?"’.
‘That’s him.
‘What about him?’.
‘He’s dead.
‘That’s a damned dismal anecdote.
You can do better than that.
‘I saw him in a book-shop once.
‘That’s better.
See how lively he can make them?’.
‘I went to call on him once in Dublin,’ P.
said.
‘With Clara Dunn.
‘What happened?’.
‘He wasn’t in.
‘By God.
I tell you the literary life’s the thing,’ Pop said.
‘You can’t beat it.
‘I hate Clara Dunn,’ I said.
‘So do I,’ said Pop.
‘What did she write?’.
‘Letters,’ I said.
‘You know Dos Passos?’.
[Pg 192]‘Never heard of him.
‘He and I used to drink hot kirsch in the winter time.
‘What happened then?’.
‘People objected, finally.
‘Only writer I ever met was Stewart Edward White,’ Pop said.
‘Used to admire his writing no end.
Damned good, you know.
Then I met him.
Didn’t like him.
‘You’re coming on,’ I said.
‘See.
There’s no trick to a literary anecdote.
‘Why didn’t you like him?’ P.
asked.
‘Do I have to tell? Isn’t the anecdote complete? It’s just like the old man tells them.
‘Go ahead and tell.
‘Too much the old timer about him.
Eyes used to vast distances and that sort of thing.
Killed too many bloody lions.
No credit kill so many lions.
Gallop ‘em, yes.
Couldn’t kill that many.
Lion kill you instead.
Writes damned fine things in The Saturday Evening Post about, what’s the bloke’s name, Andy Burnett.
Oh, damned fine.
Took an awful dislike to him, though.
See him in Nairobi with his eyes used to vast distances.
Wore his oldest clothes in town.
Hell of a fine shot, everybody says.
‘Why you’re a literary bastard,’ I said.
‘Look at that for an anecdote.
‘He’s marvellous,’ P.
said.
‘Aren’t we ever going to eat?’.
‘Thought by God we’d eaten,’ Pop said.
‘Start these anecdotes.
No end to ‘em.
After dinner we sat by the fire a little while and then[Pg 193] went to bed.
One thing seemed to be on Pop’s mind and before I went in the tent he said, ‘After you’ve waited so long, when you get a shot take it easy.
You’re fast enough so you can take your time, remember.
Take it easy.
‘All right.
‘I’ll have them get you up early.
‘All right.
I’m plenty sleepy.
‘Good night, Mr.
,’ P.
called from the tent.
‘Good night,’ Pop said.
He moved toward his tent carrying himself with comic stiffness, walking in the dark as carefully as though he were an opened bottle.
[Pg 194].
CHAPTER TWO.
Molo waked me by pulling on the blanket in the morning and I was dressing, dressed, and out washing the sleep out of my eyes before I was really awake.
It was still very dark and I could see Pop’s back shadowed against the fire.
I walked over holding the early morning cup of hot tea and milk in my hand waiting for it to be cool enough to drink.
‘Morning,’ I said.
‘Morning,’ he answered in that husky whisper.
‘Sleep?’.
‘Very well.
Feeling fit?’.
[Pg 195]‘Sleepy is all.
I drank the tea and spat the leaves into the fire.
‘Tell your bloody fortune with those,’ Pop said.
‘No fear.
Breakfast in the dark with a lantern, cool juice-slippery apricots, hash, hot-centred, brown, and catsup spread, two fried eggs and the warm promise-keeping coffee.
On the third cup Pop, watching, smoking his pipe, said, ‘Too early for me to face it yet.
‘Get you?’.
‘A little.
[Pg 196]‘I’m getting exercise,’ I said.
‘It doesn’t bother me.
‘Bloody anecdotes,’ Pop said.
‘Memsahib must think we’re silly beggars.
‘I’ll think up some more.
‘Nothing better than drinking.
Don’t know why it should make you feel bad.
‘Are you bad?’.
‘Not too.
‘Take a spot of Eno’s?’.
‘It’s this damned riding in cars.
‘Well, to-day’s the day.
‘Remember to take it very easy.
‘You’re not worried about that, are you?’.
‘Just a touch.
‘Don’t.
It never worries me a minute.
Truly.
‘Good.
Better get going.
‘Have to make a trip first.
Standing in front of the canvas circle of the latrine I looked, as each morning, at that fuzzy blur of stars that the romanticists of astronomers called the Southern Cross.
Each morning at this moment I observed the Southern Cross in solemn ceremony.
Pop was at the car.
M’Cola handed me the Springfield and I got in the front.
The tragedian and his tracker were in the back.
M’Cola climbed in with them.
‘Good luck,’ Pop said.
Someone was coming from towards the tents.
It was P.
in her blue robe and mosquito boots.
’Oh, good luck,’ she said.
’Please, good luck.
[Pg 197]I waved and we started, the headlights showing the way to the road.
There was nothing on the salt when we came up to it after leaving the car about three miles away and making a very careful stalk.
Nothing came all morning.
We sat with our heads down in the blind, each covering a different direction through openings in the thatched withes, and always I expected the miracle of a bull kudu coming majestic and beautiful through the open scrub to the grey, dusty opening in the trees where the salt lick was worn, grooved, and trampled.
There were many trails to it through the trees and on any one a bull might come silently.
But nothing came.
When the sun was up and we were warmed after the misty cold of the morning I settled my rump deeper in the dust and lay back against the wall of the hole, resting against the small of my back and my shoulders, and still able to see out through the slit in the blind.
Putting the Springfield across my knees I noticed that there was rust on the barrel.
Slowly I pulled it along and looked at the muzzle.
It was freshly brown with rust.
‘The bastard never cleaned it last night after that rain,’ I thought, and, very angry, I lifted the lug and slipped the bolt out.
M’Cola was watching me with his head down.
The other two were looking out through the blind.
I held the rifle in one hand for him to look through the breech and then put the bolt back in and shoved it forward softly, lowering it with my finger on the trigger so that it was ready to cock rather than keeping it on the safety.
[Pg 198]M’Cola had seen the rusty bore.
His face had not changed and I had said nothing but I was full of contempt and there had been indictment, evidence, and condemnation without a word being spoken.
So we sat there, he with his head bent so only the bald top showed, me leaning back and looking out through the slit, and we were no longer partners, no longer good friends, and nothing came to the salt.
At ten o’clock the breeze, which had come up in the east, began to shift around and we knew it was no use.
Our scent was being scattered in all directions around the blind as sure to frighten any animals as though we were revolving a searchlight in the dark.
We got up out of the blind and went over to look in the dust of the lick for tracks.
The rain had moistened it but it was not soaked and we saw several kudu tracks, probably made early in the night and one big bull track, long, narrow, heart-shaped; clearly, deeply cut.
We took the track and followed it on the damp reddish earth for two hours in thick bush that was like second-growth timber at home.
Finally we had to leave it in stuff we could not move through.
All this time I was angry about the uncleaned rifle and yet happy and eager with anticipation that we might jump the bull and get a snap at him in the brush.
But we did not see him and now, in the big heat of noon, we made three long circles around some hills and finally came out into a meadow full of little, humpy Masai cattle and, leaving all shade behind, trailed back across the open country under the noon sun to the car.
[Pg 199]Kamau, sitting in the car, had seen a kudu bull pass a hundred yards away.
He was headed toward the salt-lick at about nine o’clock when the wind began to be tricky, had evidently caught our scent and gone back into the hills.
Tired, sweating, and feeling more sunk than angry now, I got in beside Kamau and we headed the car toward camp.
There was only one evening left now, and no reason to expect we would have any better luck than we were having.
As we came to camp, and the shade of the heavy trees, cool as a pool, I took the bolt out of the Springfield and handed the rifle, boltless, to M’Cola without speaking or looking at him.
The bolt I tossed inside the opening of our tent on to my cot.
Pop and P.
were sitting under the dining tent.
‘No luck?’ Pop asked gently.
‘Not a damn bit.
Bull went by the car headed toward the salt.
Must have spooked off.
We hunted all over hell.
‘Didn’t you see anything?’ P.
asked.
‘Once we thought we heard you shoot.
‘That was Garrick shooting his mouth off.
Did the scouts get anything?’.
‘Not a thing.
We’ve been watching both hills.
‘Hear from Karl?’.
‘Not a word.
‘I’d like to have seen one,’ I said.
I was tired out and slipping into bitterness fast.
‘God damn them.
What the hell did he have to blow that lick to hell for the first morning and gut-shoot a lousy bull and chase him all over the son-of-a-bitching country spooking it to holy bloody hell?’.
[Pg 200]‘Bastards,’ said P.
, staying with me in my unreasonableness.
‘Sonsabitches.
‘You’re a good girl,’ I said.
‘I’m all right.
Or I will be.
‘It’s been awful,’ she said.
‘Poor old Poppa.
‘You have a drink,’ Pop said.
‘That’s what you need.
‘I’ve hunted them hard, Pop.
I swear to God I have.
I’ve enjoyed it and I haven’t worried up until to-day.
I was so damned sure.
Those damned tracks all the time—what if I never see one? How do I know we can ever get back here again?’.
‘You’ll be back,’ Pop said.
‘You don’t have to worry about that.
Go ahead.
Drink it.
‘I’m just a lousy belly-aching bastard but I swear they haven’t gotten on my nerves until to-day.
‘Belly-ache,’ said Pop.
‘Better to get it out.
‘What about lunch?’ asked P.
‘Aren’t you frightfully hungry?’.
‘The hell with lunch.
The thing is, Pop, we’ve never seen them on the salt in the evening and we’ve never seen a bull in the hills.
I’ve only got to-night.
It looks washed up.
Three times I’ve had them cold and Karl and the Austrian and the Wanderobo beat us.
‘We’re not beaten,’ said Pop.
‘Drink another one of those.
We had lunch, a very good lunch, and it was just over when Kati came and said there was someone to see Pop.
We could see their shadows on the tent fly, then they came around to the front of the tent.
It was the old man of the first day, the old farmer, but now he was gotten up[Pg 201] as a hunter and carried a long bow and a sealed quiver of arrows.
He looked older, more disreputable and tireder than ever and his get-up was obviously a disguise.
With him was the skinny, dirty, Wanderobo with the slit and curled up ears who stood on one leg and scratched the back of his knee with his toes.
His head was on one side and he had a narrow, foolish, and depraved-looking face.
The old man was talking earnestly to Pop, looking him in the eye and speaking slowly, without gestures.
‘What’s he done? Gotten himself up like that to get some of the scout money?’ I asked.
‘Wait,’ Pop said.
‘Look at the pair of them,’ I said.
‘That’s goofy Wanderobo and that lousy old fake.
What’s he say, Pop?’.
‘He hasn’t finished,’ Pop said.
Finally the old man was finished and he stood there leaning on his property bow.
They both looked very tired but I remember thinking they looked a couple of disgusting fakes.
‘He says,’ Pop began, ‘they have found a country where there are kudu and sable.
He has been there three days.
They know where there is a big kudu bull and he has a man watching him now.
‘Do you believe it?’ I could feel the liquor and the fatigue drain out of me and the excitement come in.
‘God knows,’ said Pop.
‘How far away is the country?’.
‘One day’s march.
I suppose that’s three or four hours in the car if the car can go.
[Pg 202]‘Does he think the car can get in?’.
‘None ever has been in but he thinks you can make it.
‘When did they leave the man watching the kudu?’.
‘This morning.
‘Where are the sable?’.
‘There in the hills.
‘How do we get in?’.
‘I can’t make out except that you cross the plain, go around that mountain and then south.
He says no one has ever hunted there.
He hunted there when he was young.
‘Do you believe it?’.
‘Of course natives lie like hell, but he tells it very straight.
‘Let’s go.
‘You’d better start right away.
Go as far as you can in the car and then use it for a base and hunt on from there.
The Memsahib and I will break camp in the morning, move the outfit and go on to where Dan and Mr.
are.
Once the outfit is over that black cotton stretch we’re all right if the rain catches us.
You come on and join us.
If you’re caught we can always send the car back by Kandoa, if worst comes, and the lorries down to Tanga and around.
‘Don’t you want to come?’.
‘No.
You’re better off alone on a show like this.
The more people the less game you’ll see.
You should hunt kudu alone.
I’ll move the outfit and look after the little Memsahib.
‘All right,’ I said.
‘And I don’t have to take Garrick or Abdullah?’.
[Pg 203]‘Hell, no.
Take M’Cola, Kamau and these two.
I’ll tell Molo to pack your things.
Go light as hell.
‘God damn it, Pop.
Do you think it could be true?’.
‘Maybe,’ said Pop.
‘We have to play it.
‘How do you say sable?’.
‘Tarahalla.
‘Valhalla, I can remember.
Do the females have horns?’.
‘Sure, but you can’t make a mistake.
The bull is black and they’re brown.
You can’t go wrong.
‘Has M’Cola ever seen one?’.
‘I don’t think so.
You’ve got four on your licence.
Any time you can better one, go ahead.
‘Are they hard to kill?’.
‘They’re tough.
They’re not like a kudu.
If you’ve got one down be careful how you walk up to him.
‘What about time?’.
‘We’ve got to get out.
Make it back to-morrow night if you can.
Use your own judgment.
I think this is the turning point.
You’ll get a kudu.
‘Do you know what it’s like?’ I said.
‘It’s just like when we were kids and we heard about a river no one had ever fished out on the huckleberry plain beyond the Sturgeon and the Pigeon.
‘How did the river turn out?’.
‘Listen.
We had a hell of a time to get in and the night we got there, just before dark, and saw it, there was a deep pool and a long straight stretch and the water so cold you couldn’t keep your hand in it and I threw a cigarette butt in and a big trout hit it and they kept[Pg 204] snapping it up and spitting it out as it floated until it went to pieces.
‘Big trout?’.
‘The biggest kind.
‘God save us,’ said Pop.
‘What did you do then?’.
‘Rigged up my rod and made a cast and it was dark, and there was a nighthawk swooping around and it was cold as a bastard and then I was fast to three fish the second the flies hit the water.
‘Did you land them?’.
‘The three of them.
‘You damned liar.
‘I swear to God.
‘I believe you.
Tell me the rest when you come back.
Were they big trout?’.
‘The biggest bloody kind.
‘God save us,’ said Pop.
‘You’re going to get a kudu.
Get started.
In the tent I found P.
and told her.
‘Not really?’.
‘Yes.
‘Hurry up,’ she said.
‘Don’t talk.
Get started.
I found raincoat, extra boots, socks, bathrobe, bottle of quinine tablets, citronella, note book, a pencil, my solids, the cameras, the emergency kit, knife, matches, extra shirt and undershirt, a book, two candles, money, the flask.
‘What else?’.
‘Have you got soap? Take a comb and a towel.
Got handkerchiefs?’.
[Pg 205]‘All right.
Molo had everything packed in a rucksack and I found my field glasses, M’Cola taking Pop’s big field glasses, a canteen with water and Kati sending a chop-box with food.
‘Take plenty of beer,’ Pop said.
‘You can leave it in the car.
We’re short on whisky but there’s a bottle.
‘How will that leave you?’.
‘All right.
There’s more at the other camp.
We sent two bottles on with Mr.
‘I’ll only need the flask,’ I said.
‘We’ll split the bottle.
‘Take plenty of beer then.
There’s any amount of it.
‘What’s the bastard doing?’ I said, pointing at Garrick who was getting into the car.
‘He says you and M’Cola wont be able to talk with the natives there.
You’ll have to have some one to interpret.
‘He’s poison.
‘You will need someone to interpret whatever they speak into Swahili.
‘All right.
But tell him he’s not running the show and to keep his bloody mouth shut.
‘We’ll go to the top of the hill with you,’ Pop said and we started off, the Wanderobo hanging to the side of the car.
‘Going to pick the old man up in the village.
Everyone in camp was out to watch us go.
‘Have we plenty of salt?’.
‘Yes.
Now we were standing by the car on the road in the village waiting for the old man and Garrick to come back[Pg 206] from their huts.
It was early afternoon and the sky was clouding over and I was looking at P.
, very desirable, cool, and neat-looking in her khaki and her boots, her Stetson on one side of her head, and at Pop, big, thick, in the faded corduroy sleeveless jacket that was almost white now from washing and the sun.
‘You be a good girl.
‘Don’t ever worry.
I wish I could go.
‘It’s a one-man show,’ Pop said.
‘You want to get in fast and do the dirty and get out fast.
You’ve a big load as it is.
The old man appeared and got into the back of the car with M’Cola who was wearing my old khaki sleeveless, quail-shooting coat.
‘M’Cola’s got the old man’s coat,’ Pop said.
‘He likes to carry things in the game pockets,’ I said.
M’Cola saw we were talking about him.
I had forgotten about the uncleaned rifle.
Now I remembered it and said to Pop, ‘Ask him where he got the new coat’.
M’Cola grinned and said something.
‘He says it is his property.
I grinned at him and he shook his old bald head and it was understood that I had said nothing about the rifle.
‘Where’s that bastard Garrick?’ I asked.
Finally he came with his blanket and got in with M’Cola and the old man behind.
The Wanderobo sat with me in front beside Kamau.
‘That’s a lovely-looking friend you have,’ P.
said.
‘You be good too.
I kissed her good-bye and we whispered something.
[Pg 207]‘Billing and cooing,’ Pop said.
‘Disgusting.
‘Good-bye, you old bastard.
‘Good-bye, you damned bullfighter.
‘Good-bye, sweet.
‘Good-bye and good luck.
‘You’ve plenty of petrol and we’ll leave some here,’ Pop called.
I waved and we were starting down hill through the village on a narrow track that led down and on to the scrubby dry plain that spread out below the two great blue hills.
I looked back as we went down the hill and saw the two figures, the tall thick one and the small neat one, each wearing big Stetson hats, silhouetted on the road as they walked back toward camp, then I looked ahead at the dried-up, scrubby plain.
[Pg 208].
[Pg 209].
PART IV.
PURSUIT AS HAPPINESS.
[Pg 210].
CHAPTER ONE.
The road was only a track and the plain was very discouraging to see.
As we went on we saw a few thin Grant’s gazelles showing white against the burnt yellow of the grass and the grey trees.
My exhilaration died with the stretching out of this plain, the typical poor game country, and it all began to seem very impossible and romantic and quite untrue.
The Wanderobo had a very strong odour and I looked at the way the lobes of his ear were stretched and then neatly wrapped on themselves and at his strange un-negroid, thin-lipped face.
When he saw me studying his face he smiled pleasantly and scratched his chest.
I looked around at the back of[Pg 211] the car.
M’Cola was asleep.
Garrick was sitting straight up, dramatizing his awakeness, and the old man was trying to see the road.
By now there was no more road, only a cattle track, but we were coming to the edge of the plain.
Then the plain was behind us and ahead there were big trees and we were entering a country the loveliest that I had seen in Africa.
The grass was green and smooth, short as a meadow that has been mown and is newly grown, and the trees were big, high-trunked, and old with no undergrowth but only the smooth green of the turf like a deer park and we drove on through shade and patches of sun[Pg 212]light following a faint trail the Wanderobo pointed out.
I could not believe we had suddenly come to any such wonderful country.
It was a country to wake from, happy to have had the dream and, seeing if it would clown away, I reached up and touched the Wanderobo’s ear.
He jumped and Kamau snickered.
M’Cola nudged me from the back seat and pointed and there, standing in an open space between the trees, his head up, staring at us, the bristles on his back erect, long, thick, white tusks upcurving, his eyes showing bright, was a very large wart-hog boar watching us from less than twenty yards.
I motioned to Kamau to stop and we sat looking at him and he at us.
I put the rifle up and sighted on his chest.
He watched and did not move.
Then I motioned to Kamau to throw in the clutch and we went on and made a curve to the right and left the wart-hog, who had never moved, nor showed any fright at seeing us.
I could see that Kamau was excited and, looking back, M’Cola nodded his head up and down in agreement.
None of us had ever seen a wart-hog that would not bolt off, fast-trotting, tail in air.
This was a virgin country, an un-hunted pocket in the million miles of bloody Africa.
I was ready to stop and make camp anywhere.
This was the finest country I had seen but we went on, winding along through the big trees over the softly rolling grass.
Then ahead and to the right we saw the high stockade of a Masai village.
It was a very large village and out of it came running long-legged, brown, smooth-moving men who all seemed to be of the same age and who wore their hair in a heavy club-like queue that[Pg 213] swung against their shoulders as they ran.
They came up to the car and surrounded it, all laughing and smiling and talking.
They all were tall, their teeth were white and good, and their hair was stained a red brown and arranged in a looped fringe on their foreheads.
They carried spears and they were very handsome and extremely jolly, not sullen, nor contemptuous like the northern Masai, and they wanted to know what we were going to do.
The Wanderobo evidently said we were hunting kudu and were in a hurry.
They had the car surrounded so we could not move.
One said something and three or four others joined in and Kamau explained to me that they had seen two kudu bulls go along the trail in the afternoon.
‘It can’t be true,’ I said to myself.
‘It can’t be.
I told Kamau to start and slowly we pushed through them, they all laughing and trying to stop the car, making it all but run over them.
They were the tallest, best-built, handsomest people I had ever seen and the first truly light-hearted happy people I had seen in Africa.
Finally, when we were moving, they started to run beside the car smiling and laughing and showing how easily they could run and then, as the going was better, up the smooth valley of a stream, it became a contest and one after another dropped out of the running, waving and smiling as they left until there were only two still running with us, the finest runners of the lot, who kept pace easily with the car as they moved long-legged, smoothly, loosely, and with pride.
They were running too, at the pace of a fast miler, and carrying their spears[Pg 214] as well.
Then we had to turn to the right and climb out of the putting-green smoothness of the valley into a rolling meadow and, as we slowed, climbing in first gear, the whole pack came up again, laughing and trying not to seem winded.
We went through a little knot of brush and a small rabbit started out, zigzagging wildly and all the Masai behind now in a mad sprint.
They caught the rabbit and the tallest runner came up with him to the car and handed him to me.
I held him and could feel the thumping of his heart through the soft, warm, furry body, and as I stroked him the Masai patted my arm.
Holding him by the ears I handed him back.
No, no, he was mine.
He was a present.
I handed him to M’Cola.
M’Cola did not take him seriously and handed him to one of the Masai.
We were moving and they were running again now.
The Masai stooped and put the rabbit on the ground and as he ran free they all laughed.
M’Cola shook his head.
We were all very impressed by these Masai.
‘Good Masai,’ M’Cola said, very moved.
‘Masai many cattle.
Masai no kill to eat.
Masai kill man.
The Wanderobo patted himself on the chest.
‘Wanderobo.
Masai,’ he said, very proudly, claiming kin.
His ears were curled in the same way theirs were.
Seeing them running and so damned handsome and so happy made us all happy.
I had never seen such quick disinterested friendliness, nor such fine-looking people.
‘Good Masai,’ M’Cola repeated, nodding his head emphatically.
’Good, good Masai.
’ Only Garrick seemed[Pg 215] impressed in a different way.
For all his khaki clothes and his letter from B’wana Simba, I believe these Masai frightened him in a very old place.
They were our friends, not his.
They certainly were our friends though.
They had that attitude that makes brothers, that unexpressed but instant and complete acceptance that you must be Masai wherever it is you come from.
That attitude you only get from the best of the English, the best of the Hungarians and the very best Spaniards; the thing that used to be the most clear distinction of nobility when there was nobility.
It is an ignorant attitude and the people who have it do not survive, but very few pleasanter things ever happen to you than the encountering of it.
So now there were only the two of them left again, running, and it was hard going and the machine was beating them.
They were still running well and still loose and long but the machine was a cruel pacemaker.
So I told Kamau to speed it up and get it over with because a sudden burst of speed was not the humiliation of a steady using.
They sprinted, were beaten, laughed, and then we were leaning out, waving, and they stood leaning on their spears and waved.
We were still great friends but now we were alone again and there was no track, only the general direction to follow around clumps of trees and along the run of this green valley.
After a little the trees grew closer and we left the idyllic country behind and now were picking our way along a faint trail through thick second-growth.
Sometimes we came to a dead halt and had to get out and pull a log[Pg 216] out of the way or cut a tree that blocked the body of the car.
Sometimes we had to back out of bush and look for a way to circle around and come upon the trail again, chopping our way through with the long brush knives that are called pangas.
The Wanderobo was a pitiful chopper and Garrick was little better.
M’Cola did everything well in which a knife was used and he swung a panga with a fast yet heavy and vindictive stroke.
I used it badly.
There was too much wrist in it to learn it quickly; your wrist tired and the blade seemed to have a weight it did not have.
I wished that I had a Michigan double-bitted axe, honed razor-sharp, to chop with instead of this sabring of trees.
Chopping through when we were stopped, avoiding all we could, Kamau driving with intelligence and a sound feeling for the country, we came through the difficult going and out into another open-meadow stretch and could see a range of hills off to our right.
But here there had been a recent heavy rain and we had to be very careful about the low parts of the meadow where the tyres cut in through the turf to mud and spun in the slick greasiness.
We cut brush and shovelled out twice and then, having learned not to trust any low part, we skirted the high edge of the meadow and then were in timber again.
As we came out, after several long circles in the woods to find places where we could get the car through, we were on the bank of a stream, where there was a sort of brushy bridging across the bed built like a beaver dam and evidently designed to hold back the water.
On the other side was a thorn-brush-fenced cornfield, a steep,[Pg 217] stump-scattered bank with corn planted all over it and some abandoned looking corrals or thorn-bush-fenced enclosures with mud and stick buildings and to the right there were cone-shaped grass huts projecting above a heavy thorn fence.
We all got out, for this stream was a problem, and, on the other side, the only place we could get up the bank led through the stump-filled maize field.
The old man said the rain had come that day.
There had been no water going over the brushy dam when they had passed that morning.
I was feeling fairly depressed.
Here we had come through a beautiful country of virgin timber where kudu had been once seen walking along the trail to end up stuck on the bank of a little creek in someone’s cornfield.
I had not expected any cornfield and I resented it.
I thought we would have to get permission to drive through the maize, provided we could make it across the stream and up the bank and I took off my shoes and waded across the stream to test it underfoot.
The brush and saplings on the bottom were packed hard and firm and I was sure we could cross if we took it fairly fast.
M’Cola and Kamau agreed and we walked up the bank to see how it would be.
The mud of the bank was soft but there was dry earth underneath and I figured we could shovel our way up if we could get through the stumps.
But we would need to unload before we tried it.
Coming toward us, from the direction of the huts, were two men and a boy.
I said ‘Jambo’, as they came up.
They answered ‘Jambo’, and then the old man and the Wanderobo talked with them.
M’Cola shook his head at me.
He did not understand a word.
I thought we were[Pg 218] asking permission to go through the corn.
When the old man finished talking the two men came closer and we shook hands.
They looked like no negroes I had ever seen.
Their faces were a grey brown, the oldest looked to be about fifty, had thin lips, an almost Grecian nose, rather high cheekbones, and large, intelligent eyes.
He had great poise and dignity and seemed to be very intelligent.
The younger man had the same cast of features and I took him for a younger brother.
He looked about thirty-five.
The boy was as pretty as a girl and looked rather shy and stupid.
I had thought he was a girl from his face for an instant when he first came up, as they all wore a sort of Roman toga of unbleached muslin gathered at the shoulder that revealed no line of their bodies.
They were talking with the old man, who, now that I looked at him standing with them, seemed to bear a sort of wrinkled and degenerate resemblance to the classic-featured owner of the shamba; just as the Wanderobo-Masai was a shrivelled caricature of the handsome Masai we had met in the forest.
Then we all went down to the stream and Kamau and I rigged ropes around the tyres to act as chains while the Roman elder and the rest unloaded the car and carried the heaviest things up the steep bank.
Then we crossed in a wild, water-throwing smash and, all pushing heavily, made it halfway up the bank before we stuck.
We chopped and dug out and finally made it to the top of the bank but ahead was that maize field and I could not figure where we were to go from there.
[Pg 219]‘Where do we go?’ I asked the Roman elder.
They did not understand Garrick’s interpreting and the old man made the question clear.
The Roman pointed toward the heavy thorn-bush fence to the left at the edge of the woods.
‘We can’t get through there in the car.
‘Campi,’ said M’Cola, meaning we were going to camp there.
‘Hell of a place,’ I said.
‘Campi,’ M’Cola said firmly and they all nodded.
‘Campi! Campi!’ said the old man.
‘There we camp,’ Garrick announced pompously.
‘You go to hell,’ I told him cheerfully.
I walked toward the camp site with the Roman who was talking steadily in a language I could not understand a word of.
M’Cola was with me and the others were loading and following with the car.
I was remembering that I had read you must never camp in abandoned native quarters because of ticks and other hazards and I was preparing to hold out against this camp.
We entered a break in the thorn-bush fence and inside was a building of logs and saplings stuck in the ground and crossed with branches.
It looked like a big chicken coop.
The Roman made us free of this and of the enclosure with a wave of his hand and kept on talking.
‘Bugs,’ I said to M’Cola in Swahili, speaking with strong disapproval.
‘No,’ he said, dismissing the idea.
‘No bugs.
‘Bad bugs.
Many bugs.
Sickness.
‘No bugs,’ he said firmly.
[Pg 220]The no-bugs had it and with the Roman talking steadily, I hoped on some congenial topic, the car came up, stopped under a huge tree about fifty yards from the thorn-bush fence and they all commenced carrying the necessities in for the making of camp.
My ground-sheet tent was slung between a tree and one side of the chicken coop and I sat down on a petrol case to discuss the shooting situation with the Roman, the old man, and Garrick, while Kamau and M’Cola fixed up a camp and the Wanderobo-Masai stood on one leg and let his mouth hang open.
‘Where were kudu?’.
‘Back there,’ waving his arm.
‘Big ones?’.
Arms spread to show hugeness of horns and a torrent from the Roman.
Me, dictionary-ing heavily, ‘Where was the one they were watching?’.
No results on this but a long speech from the Roman which I took to mean they were watching them all.
It was late afternoon now and the sky was heavy with clouds.
I was wet to the waist and my socks were mud soaked.
Also I was sweating from pushing on the car and from chopping.
‘When do we start?’ I asked.
‘To-morrow,’ Garrick answered without bothering to question the Roman.
‘No,’ I said.
‘To-night.
‘To-morrow,’ Garrick said.
‘Late now.
One hour light.
’ He showed me one hour on my watch.
[Pg 221]I dictionaried.
‘Hunt to-night.
Last hour best hour.
Garrick implied that the kudu were too far away.
That it was impossible to hunt and return, all this with gestures, ‘Hunt to-morrow’.
‘You bastard,’ I said in English.
All this time the Roman and the old man had been standing saying nothing.
I shivered.
It was cold with the sun under the clouds in spite of the heaviness of the air after rain.
‘Old man,’ I said.
‘Yes, Master,’ said the old man.
Dictionary-ing carefully, I said, ‘Hunt kudu to-night.
Last hour best hour.
Kudu close?’.
‘Maybe.
‘Hunt now?’.
They talked together.
‘Hunt to-morrow,’ Garrick put in.
‘Shut up, you actor,’ I said.
‘Old man.
Little hunt now?’.
‘Yes,’ said the old man and Roman nodded.
‘Little while.
‘Good,’ I said, and went to find a shirt and undershirt and a pair of socks.
‘Hunt now,’ I told M’Cola.
‘Good,’ he said.
‘M’uzuri.
With the clean feeling of dry shirt, fresh socks and a change of boots I sat on the petrol case and drank a whisky and water while I waited for the Roman to come back.
I felt certain I was going to have a shot at kudu and I wanted to take the edge off so I would not be nervous.
Also I wanted not to catch a cold.
Also I[Pg 222] wanted the whisky for itself, because I loved the taste of it and because, being as happy as I could be, it made me feel even better.
I saw the Roman coming and I pulled the zippers up on my boots, checked the cartridges in the magazine of the Springfield, took off the foresight protector and blew through the rear aperture.
Then I drank what was left in the tin cup that was on the ground by the box and stood up, checking that I had a pair of handkerchiefs in my shirt pockets.
M’Cola came carrying his knife and Pop’s big glasses.
‘You stay here,’ I said to Garrick.
He did not mind.
He thought we were silly to go out so late and he was glad to prove us wrong.
The Wanderobo wanted to go.
‘That’s plenty,’ I said, and waved the old man back and we started out of the corral with the Roman ahead, carrying a spear, then me, then M’Cola with glasses and the Mannlicher, full of solids, and last the Wanderobo-Masai with another spear.
It was after five when we struck off across the maize field and down to the stream, crossing where it narrowed in a high grass a hundred yards above the dam and then, walking slowly and carefully, went up the grassy bank on the far side, getting soaked to the waist as we stooped going through the wet grass and bracken.
We had not been gone ten minutes and were moving carefully up the stream bank, when, without warning, the Roman grabbed my arm and pulled me bodily down to the ground as he crouched; me pulling back the bolt to cock the rifle as I dropped.
Holding his breath he pointed and across[Pg 223] the stream on the far bank at the edge of the trees was a large, grey animal, white stripes showing on his flanks and huge horns curling back from his head as he stood, broadside to us, head up, seeming to be listening.
I raised the rifle, but there was a bush in the way of the shot.
I could not shoot over the bush without standing.
‘Piga,’ whispered M’Cola.
I shook my finger and commenced to crawl forward to be clear of the bush, sick afraid the bull would jump while I was trying to make the shot certain, but remembering Pop’s ‘Take your time’.
When I saw I was clear I got on one knee, saw the bull through the aperture, marvelling at how big he looked, and then, remembering not to have it matter, that it was the same as any other shot, I saw the bead centred exactly where it should be just below the top of the shoulder and squeezed off.
At the roar he jumped and was going into the brush, but I knew I had hit him.
I shot at a show of grey between the trees as he went in and M’Cola was shouting, ‘Piga! Piga!’ meaning ‘He’s hit! He’s hit!’ and the Roman was slapping me on the shoulder, then he had his toga up around his neck and was running naked, and the four of us were running now, full speed, like hounds, splashing across the stream, tearing up the bank, the Roman ahead, crashing naked through the brush, then stooping and holding up a leaf with bright blood, slamming me on the back, M’Cola saying, ‘Damu! Damu!’ (blood, blood), then the deep cut tracks off to the right, me reloading, we all trailing in a dead run, it almost dark in the timber, the Roman, confused a moment by the trail, making a cast off to the[Pg 224] right, then picking up blood once more, then pulling me down again with a jerk on my arm and none of us breathing as we saw him standing in a clearing a hundred yards ahead, looking to me hard-hit and looking back, wide ears spread, big, grey, white-striped, his horns a marvel, as he looked straight toward us over his shoulder.
I thought I must make absolutely sure this time, now, with the dark coming and I held my breath and shot him a touch behind the fore-shoulder.
We heard the bullet smack and saw him buck heavily with the shot.
M’Cola shouted, ‘Piga! Piga! Piga!’ as he went out of sight and as we ran again, like hounds, we almost fell over something.
It was a huge, beautiful kudu bull, stone-dead, on his side, his horns in great dark spirals, widespread and unbelievable as he lay dead five yards from where we stood when I had just that instant shot.
I looked at him, big, long-legged, a smooth grey with the white stripes and the great curling, sweeping horns, brown as walnut meats, and ivory pointed, at the big ears and the great, lovely heavy-maned neck, the white chevron between his eyes and the white of his muzzle and I stooped over and touched him to try to believe it.
He was lying on the side where the bullet had gone in and there was not a mark on him and he smelled sweet and lovely like the breath of cattle and the odour of thyme after rain.
Then the Roman had his arms around my neck and M’Cola was shouting in a strange high sing-song voice and Wanderobo-Masai kept slapping me on the shoulder and jumping up and down and then one after the other[Pg 225] they all shook hands in a strange way that I had never known in which they took your thumb in their fist and held it and shook it and pulled it and held it again, while they looked you in the eyes, fiercely.
We all looked at him and M’Cola knelt and traced the curve of his horns with his finger and measured the spread with his arms and kept crooning, ‘Oo-oo-eee-eee’, making small high noises of ecstasy and stroking the kudu’s muzzle and his mane.
I slapped the Roman on the back and we went through the thumb-pulling again; me pulling his thumb too.
I embraced the Wanderobo-Masai and he, after a thumb-pulling of great intensity and feeling, slapped his chest and said very proudly, ‘Wanderobo-Masai wonderful guide’.
‘Wanderobo-Masai wonderful Masai,’ I said.
M’Cola kept shaking his head, looking at the kudu and making the strange small noises.
Then he said, ‘Doumi, Doumi, Doumi! B’wana Kabor Kidogo, Kidogo’.
Meaning this was a bull of bulls.
That Karl’s had been a little one, a nothing.
We all knew we had killed the other kudu that I had mistaken for this one, while this first one was lying dead from the first shot, and it seemed of no importance beside the miracle of this kudu.
But I wanted to see the other.
‘Come on, kudu,’ I said.
‘He’s dead,’ said M’Cola.
‘Kufa!’.
‘Come on.
‘This one best.
[Pg 226]‘Come on.
‘Measure,’ M’Cola pleaded.
I ran the steel tape around the curve of one horn, M’Cola holding it down.
It was well over fifty inches.
M’Cola looked at me anxiously.
‘Big! Big!’ I said.
‘Twice as big as B’wana Kabor.
‘Eee-eee,’ he crooned.
‘Come on,’ I said.
The Roman was off already.
We cut for where we saw the bull when I shot and there were the tracks with blood breast high on the leaves in the brush from the start.
In a hundred yards we came on him absolutely dead.
He was not quite as big as the first bull.
The horns were as long, but narrower, but he was as beautiful, and he lay on his side, bending down the brush where he fell.
We all shook hands again, using the thumb which evidently denoted extreme emotion.
‘This askari,’ M’Cola explained.
This bull was the policeman or bodyguard for the bigger one.
He had evidently been in the timber when we had seen the first bull, had run with him, and had looked back to see why the big bull did not follow.
I wanted pictures and told M’Cola to go back to camp with the Roman and bring the two cameras, the Graflex and the cinema camera and my flashlight.
I knew we were on the same side of the stream and above the camp and I hoped the Roman could make a short cut and get back before the sun set.
They went off and now, at the end of the day, the sun came out brightly below the clouds and the Wanderobo-[Pg 227]Masai and I looked at this kudu, measured his horns, smelled the fine smell of him, sweeter than an eland even, stroked his nose, his neck, and his shoulder, marvelling at his great ears, and the smoothness and cleanness of his hide, looked at his hooves, that were built long, narrow, and springy, so he seemed to walk on tip-toe, felt under his shoulder for the bullet-hole and then shook hands again while the Wanderobo-Masai told what a man he was and I told him he was my pal and gave him my best four-bladed pocket knife.
‘Let’s go look at the first one, Wanderobo-Masai,’ I said in English.
The Wanderobo-Masai nodded, understanding perfectly, and we trailed back to where the big one lay in the edge of the little clearing.
We circled him, looking at him and then the Wanderobo-Masai, reaching underneath while I held the shoulder up, found the bullet hole and put his finger in.
Then he touched his forehead with the bloody finger and made the speech about ‘Wanderobo-Masai wonderful guide!’.
‘Wanderobo-Masai king of guides,’ I said.
‘Wanderobo-Masai my pal.
I was wet through with sweat and I put on my raincoat that M’Cola had been carrying and left behind and turned the collar up around my neck.
I was watching the sun now and worrying about it being gone before they got up with the cameras.
In a little while we could hear them coming in the brush and I shouted to let them know where we were.
M’Cola answered and we shouted[Pg 228] back and forth and I could hear them talking and crashing in the brush while I would shout and watch the sun which was almost down.
Finally I saw them and I shouted to M’Cola, ‘Run, run’, and pointed to the sun, but there was no run left in them.
They had made a fast trip uphill, through heavy brush, and when I got the camera, opened the lens wide and focused on the bull the sun was only lighting the tops of the trees.
I took half a dozen exposures and used the cinema while they all dragged the kudu to where there seemed to be a little more light, then the sun was down and, obligation to try to get a picture over, I put the camera into its case and settled, happily, with the darkness into the unresponsibility of victory; only emerging to direct M’Cola in where to cut to make a full enough cape when skinning out the head-skin.
M’Cola used a knife beautifully and I liked to watch him skin-out, but to-night, after I had shown him where to make the first cut, well down on the legs, around the lower chest where it joined the belly and well back over the withers, I did not watch him because I wanted to remember the bull as I had first seen him, so I went, in the dusk, to the second kudu and waited there until they came with the flashlight and then, remembering that I had skinned-out or seen skinned-out every animal that I had ever shot, yet remembered every one exactly as he was at every moment, that one memory does not destroy another, and that the not-watching idea was only laziness and a form of putting the dishes in the sink until morning, I held the flashlight for M’Cola while he worked on the second bull and,[Pg 229] although tired, enjoyed as always his fast, clean, delicate scalpeling with the knife, until, the cape all clear and spread back he nocked through the connection of the skull and the spine and then, twisting with the horns, swung the head loose and lifted it, cape and all, free from the neck, the cape hanging heavy and wet in the light of the electric torch that shone on his red hands and on the dirty khaki of his tunic.
We left the Wanderobo-Masai, Garrick, the Roman, and his brother with a lantern to skin out and pack in the meat and M’Cola with a head, the old man with a head, and me with the flashlight and the two guns, we started in the dark back for camp.
In the dark the old man fell flat and M’Cola laughed; then the cape unrolled and came down over his face and he almost choked and we both laughed.
The old man laughed too.
Then M’Cola fell in the dark and the old man and I laughed.
A little farther on I went through the covering on some sort of game pit and went flat on my face and got up to hear M’Cola chuckling and choking and the old man giggling.
‘What the hell is this? A Chaplin comedy?’ I asked them in English.
They were both laughing under the heads.
We got to the thorn-bush fence, finally, after a nightmare march through the brush and saw the fire at the camp and M’Cola seemed to be delighted when the old man fell going through the thorns and got up cursing and seeming barely able to lift the head as I shone the flash ahead of him to show him the opening.
We came up to the fire and I could see the old man’s[Pg 230] face bleeding as he put the head down against the stick and mud cabin.
M’Cola put his head down, pointed at the old man’s face and laughed and shook his head.
I looked at the old man.
He was completely done-in, his face was badly scratched, covered with mud and bleeding, and he was chuckling happily.
‘B’wana fell down,’ M’Cola said and imitated me pitching forward.
They both chuckled.
I made as though to take a swing at him and said, ‘Shenzi!’.
He imitated me falling down again and then there was Kamau shaking hands very gently and respectfully and saying, ‘Good, B’wana! Very good, B’wana!’ and then going over to the heads, his eyes shining and kneeling, stroking the horns and feeling the ears and crooning the same, sighing, ‘Ooo-ooo! Eee-eee!’ noises M’Cola had made.
I went into the dark of the tent, we had left the lantern with the meat bringers, and washed, took off my wet clothes and feeling in the dark in my rucksack found a pair of pyjamas and a bath-robe.
I came out to the fire wearing these and mosquito boots.
I brought my wet things and my boots to the fire and Kamau spread them on sticks, and put the boots, each one leg-down, on a stick and back far enough from the blaze where the fire would not scorch them.
In the firelight I sat on a petrol box with my back against a tree and Kamau brought the whisky flask and poured some in a cup and I added water from the canteen and sat drinking and looking in the fire, not think[Pg 231]ing, in complete happiness, feeling the whisky warm me and smooth me as you straighten the wrinkled sheet in a bed, while Kamau brought tins from the provisions to see what I would eat for supper.
There were three tins of Christmas special mincemeat, three tins of salmon, and three of mixed fruit, there were also a number of cakes of chocolate and a tin of Special Christmas Plum Pudding.
I sent these back wondering what Kati had imagined the mincemeat to be.
We had been looking for that plum pudding for two months.
‘Meat?’ I asked.
Kamau brought a thick, long chunk of roast Grant gazelle tenderloin from one of the Grant Pop had shot on the plain while we had been hunting the twenty-five-mile salt-lick, and some bread.
‘Beer?’.
He brought one of the big German litre bottles and opened it.
It seemed too complicated sitting on the petrol case and I spread my raincoat on the ground in front of the fire where the ground had been dried by the heat and stretched my legs out, leaning my back against the wooden case.
The old man was roasting meat on a stick.
It was a choice piece he had brought with him wrapped in his toga.
In a little while they all began to come in carrying meat and the hides and then I was stretched out drinking beer and watching the fire and all around they were talking and roasting meat on sticks.
It was getting cold and the night was clear and there was the smell of the roasting meat, the smell of the smoke of the fire, the[Pg 232] smell of my boots steaming, and, where he squatted close, the smell of the good old Wanderobo-Masai.
But I could remember the odour of the kudu as he lay in the woods.
Each man had his own meat or collection of pieces of meat on sticks stuck around the fire, they turned them and tended them, and there was much talking.
Two others that I had not seen had come over from the huts and the boy we had seen in the afternoon was with them.
I was eating a piece of hot broiled liver I had lifted from one of the sticks of the Wanderobo-Masai and wondering where the kidneys were.
The liver was delicious.
I was wondering whether it was worth while getting up to get the dictionary to ask about the kidneys when M’Cola said, ‘Beer?’.
‘All right.
He brought the bottle, opened it, and I lifted it and drank half of it off to chase down that liver.
‘It’s a hell of a life,’ I told him in English.
He grinned and said, ‘More beer?’ in Swahili.
My talking English to him was an acceptable joke.
‘Watch,’ I said, and tipped the bottle up and let it all go down.
It was an old trick we learned in Spain drinking out of wine skins without swallowing.
This impressed the Roman greatly.
He came over, squatted down by the raincoat and started to talk.
He talked for a long time.
‘Absolutely,’ I told him in English.
‘And furthermore he can take the sleigh.
‘More beer?’ M’Cola asked.
[Pg 233]‘You want to see the old man tight, I suppose?’.
‘N’Dio,’ he said.
‘Yes,’ pretending to understand the English.
‘Watch it, Roman.
’ I started to let the beer go down, saw the Roman following the motion with his own throat, started to choke, barely recovered, and lowered the bottle.
‘That’s all.
Can’t do it more than twice in an evening.
Makes you liverish.
The Roman went on talking in his language.
I heard him say Simba twice.
‘Simba here?’.
‘No,’ he said.
‘Over there,’ waving at the dark, and I could not make out the story.
But it sounded very good.
‘Me plenty Simba,’ I said.
‘Hell of a man with Simba.
Ask M’Cola.
’ I could feel that I was getting the evening braggies but Pop and P.
weren’t here to listen.
It was not nearly so satisfactory to brag when you could not be understood, still it was better than nothing.
I definitely had the braggies, on beer, too.
‘Amazing,’ I told the Roman.
He went on with his own story.
There was a little beer in the bottom of the bottle.
‘Old Man,’ I said.
‘Mzee.
‘Yes, B’wana,’ said the old man.
‘Here’s some beer for you.
You’re old enough, so it can’t hurt you.
I had seen the old man’s eyes while he watched me drink and I knew he was another of the same.
He took[Pg 234] the bottle, drained it to the last bit of froth and crouched by his meat sticks holding the bottle lovingly.
‘More beer?’ asked M’Cola.
‘Yes,’ I said.
‘And my cartridges.
The Roman had gone on steadily talking.
He could tell a longer story even than Carlos in Cuba.
‘That’s mighty interesting,’ I told him.
‘You’re a hell of a fellow, too.
We’re both good.
Listen.
’ M’Cola had brought the beer and my khaki coat with the cartridges in the pocket.
I drank a little beer, noted the old man watching and spread out six cartridges.
‘I’ve got the braggies,’ I said.
‘You have to stand for this, look!’ I touched each of the cartridges in turn, ‘Simba, Simba, Faro, Nyati, Tendalla, Tendalla.
What do you think of that? You don’t have to believe it.
Look, M’Cola!’ and I named the six cartridges again.
‘Lion, lion, rhino, buffalo, kudu, kudu.
‘Ayee!’ said the Roman excitedly.
‘N’Dio,’ said M’Cola solemnly.
‘Yes, it is true.
‘Ayee!’ said the Roman and grabbed me by the thumb.
‘God’s truth,’ I said.
‘Highly improbable, isn’t it?’.
‘N’Dio,’ said M’Cola, counting them over himself.
‘Simba, Simba, Faro, Nyati, Tendalla, Tendalla!’.
‘You can tell the others,’ I said in English.
‘That’s a hell of a big piece of bragging.
That’ll hold me for to-night.
The Roman went on talking to me again and I listened carefully and ate another piece of the broiled liver.
M’Cola was working on the heads now, skinning out one skull and showing Kamau how to skin out the easy part[Pg 235] of the other.
It was a big job to do for the two of them, working carefully around the eyes and the muzzle and the cartilage of the ears, and afterwards flesh all of the head skins so they would not spoil, and they were working at it very delicately and carefully in the firelight.
I do not remember going to bed, nor if we went to bed.
I remember getting the dictionary and asking M’Cola to ask the boy if he had a sister and M’Cola saying, ‘No, No’, to me very firmly and solemnly.
‘Nothing tendacious, you understand.
Curiosity.
M’Cola was firm.
‘No,’ he said and shook his head.
‘Hapana,’ in the same tone he used when we followed the lion into the sanseviera that time.
That disposed of the opportunities for social life and I looked up kidneys and the Roman’s brother produced some from his lot and I put a piece between two pieces of liver on a stick and started it broiling.
‘Make an admirable breakfast,’ I said out loud.
‘Much better than mincemeat.
Then we had a long talk about sable.
The Roman did not call them Tarahalla and that name meant nothing to him.
There was some confusion about buffalo because the Roman kept saying ‘nyati’, but he meant they were black like the buff.
Then we drew pictures in the dust of ashes from the fire and what he meant were sable all right.
The horns curved back like scimitars, way back over their withers.
‘Bulls?’ I said.
‘Bulls and cows.
[Pg 236]With the old man and Garrick interpreting, I believed I made out that there were two herds.
‘To-morrow.
‘Yes,’ the Roman said.
‘To-morrow.
‘’Cola,’ I said.
‘To-day, kudu.
To-morrow, sable, buffalo, Simba.
‘Hapana, buffalo!’ he said and shook his head.
Hapana, Simba!’.
‘Me and the Wanderobo-Masai buffalo,’ I said.
‘Yes,’ said the Wanderobo-Masai excitedly.
‘Yes.
‘There are very big elephants near here,’ Garrick said.
‘To-morrow, elephants,’ I said, teasing M’Cola.
‘Hapana elephants!’ He knew it was teasing but he did not even want to hear it said.
‘Elephants,’ I said.
‘Buffalo, Simba, leopard.
The Wanderobo-Masai was nodding excitedly.
‘Rhino,’ he put in.
‘Hapana!’ M’Cola said shaking his head.
He was beginning to suffer.
‘In those hills many buffalo,’ the old man interpreted for the now very excited Roman who was standing and pointing beyond where the huts were.
‘Hapana! Hapana! Hapana!’ M’Cola said definitely and finally.
‘More beer?’ putting down his knife.
‘All right,’ I said.
‘I’m just kidding you.
M’Cola was crouched close talking, making an explanation.
I heard Pop’s title and I thought it was that Pop would not like it.
That Pop would not want it.
‘I was just kidding you,’ I said in English.
Then in Swahili, ‘To-morrow, sable?’.
[Pg 237]‘Yes,’ he said feelingly.
‘Yes.
After that the Roman and I had a long talk in which I spoke Spanish and he spoke whatever it was he spoke and I believe we planned the entire campaign for the next day.
[Pg 238].
CHAPTER TWO.
I do not remember going to bed nor getting up, only being by the fire in the grey before daylight, with a tin cup of hot tea in my hand and my breakfast, on the stick, not looking nearly so admirable and very over-blown with ashes.
The Roman was standing making an oration with gestures in the direction where the light was beginning to show and I remember wondering if the bastard had talked all night.
The head skins were all spread and neatly salted and the skulls with the horns were leaning against the log and stick house.
M’Cola was folding the head skins.
Kamau brought me the tins and I told him to open one[Pg 239] of fruit.
It was cold from the night and the mixed fruit and the cold syrupy juice sucked down smoothly.
I drank another cup of tea, went in the tent, dressed, put on my dry boots and we were ready to start.
The Roman had said we would be back before lunch.
We had the Roman’s brother as guide.
The Roman was going, as near as I could make out, to spy on one of the herds of sable and we were going to locate the other.
We started out with the brother ahead, wearing a toga and carrying a spear, then me with the Springfield slung and my small Zeiss glasses in my pocket, then M’Cola with Pop’s glasses, slung on one side, water can[Pg 240]teen on the other, skinning knife, whetstone, extra box of cartridges, and cakes of chocolates in his pockets, and the big gun over his shoulder, then the old man with the Graflex, Garrick with the movie camera, and the Wanderobo-Masai with a spear and bow and arrows.
We said good-bye to the Roman and started out of the thorn-bush fence just as the sun came through the gap in the hills and shone on the cornfield, the huts and the blue hills beyond.
It promised to be a fine clear day.
The brother led the way through some heavy brush that soaked us all; then through the open forest, then steeply uphill until we were well up on the slope that rose behind the edge of the field where we were camped.
Then we were on a good smooth trail that graded back into these hills above which the sun had not yet risen.
I was enjoying the early morning, still a little sleepy, going along a little mechanically and starting to think that we were a very big outfit to hunt quietly, although everyone seemed to move quietly enough, when we saw two people coming towards us.
They were a tall, good-looking man with features like the Roman’s, but slightly less noble, wearing a toga and carrying a bow and quiver of arrows, and behind him, his wife, very pretty, very modest, very wifely, wearing a garment of brown tanned skins and neck ornament of concentric copper wire circles and many wire circles on her arms and ankles.
We halted, said ‘Jambo’, and the brother talked to this seeming tribesman who had the air of a business man on the way to his office in the city and, as they spoke in rapid question and answer, I[Pg 241] watched the most freshly brideful wife who stood a little in profile so that I saw her pretty pear-shaped breasts and the long, clean niggery legs and was studying her pleasant profile most profitably until her husband spoke to her suddenly and sharply, then in explanation and quiet command, and she moved around us, her eyes down, and went on along the trail that we had come, alone, we all watching her.
The husband was going on with us, it seemed.
He had seen the sable that morning and, slightly suspicious, obviously displeased at leaving that now out-of-sight wife of wives that we all had taken with our eyes, he led us off and to the right along another trail, well-worn and smooth, through woods that looked like fall at home and where you might expect to flush a grouse and have him whirr off to the other hill or pitch down in the valley.
So, sure enough we put up partridges and, watching them fly, I was thinking all the country in the world is the same country and all hunters are the same people.
Then we saw a fresh kudu track beside the trail and then, as we moved through the early morning woods, no undergrowth now, the first sun coming through the tops of the trees, we came on the ever miracle of elephant tracks, each one as big around as the circle you make with your arms putting your hands together, and sunk a foot deep in the loam of the forest floor, where some bull had passed, travelling after rain.
Looking at the way the tracks graded down through the pleasant forest I thought that we had the mammoths too, a long time ago, and when they travelled through the hills in southern Illinois[Pg 242] they made these same tracks.
It was just that we were an older country in America and the biggest game was gone.
We kept along the face of this hill on a pleasant sort of jutting plateau and then came out to the edge of the hill where there was a valley and a long open meadow with timber on the far side and a circle of hills at its upper end where another valley went off to the left.
We stood in the edge of the timber on the face of this hill looking across the meadow valley which extended to the open out in a steep sort of grassy basin at the upper end where it was backed by the hills.
To our left there were steep, rounded, wooded hills, with outcroppings of limestone rock that ran, from where we stood, up to the very head of the valley, and there formed part of the other range of hills that headed it.
Below us, to the right, the country was rough and broken in hills and stretches of meadow and then a steep fall of timber that ran to the blue hills we had seen to the westward beyond the huts where the Roman and his family lived.
I judged camp to be straight down below us and about five miles to the north-west through the timber.
The husband was standing, talking to the brother and gesturing and pointing out that he had seen the sable feeding on the opposite side of the meadow valley and that they must have fed either up or down the valley.
We sat in the shelter of the trees and sent the Wanderobo-Masai down into the valley to look for tracks.
He came back and reported there were no tracks leading down the valley below us and to the westward, so we knew they had fed on up the meadow valley.
[Pg 243]Now the problem was to so use the terrain that we might locate them, and get up and into range of them without being seen.
The sun was coming over the hills at the head of the valley and shone on us while everything at the head of the valley was in heavy shadow.
I told the outfit to stay where they were in the woods, except for M’Cola and the husband who would go with me, we keeping in the timber and grading up our side of the valley until we could be above and see into the pocket of the curve at the upper end to glass it for the sable.
You ask how this was discussed, worked out, and understood with the bar of language, and I say it was as freely discussed and clearly understood as though we were a cavalry patrol all speaking the same language.
We were all hunters except, possibly, Garrick, and the whole thing could be worked out, understood, and agreed to without using anything but a forefinger to signal and a hand to caution.
We left them and worked very carefully ahead, well back in the timber to get height.
Then, when we were far enough up and along, we crawled out on to a rocky place and, being behind rock, shielding the glasses with my hat so they would not reflect the sun, M’Cola nodding and grunting as he saw the practicability of that, we glassed the opposite side of the meadow around the edge of the timber, and up into the pocket at the head of the valley; and there they were.
M’Cola saw them just before I did and pulled my sleeve.
‘N’Dio,’ I said.
Then I held my breath to watch them.
All looked very black, big necked, and heavy.
All had the back-curving horns.
They were a long way away.
Some[Pg 244] were lying down.
One was standing.
We could see seven.
‘Where’s the bull?’ I whispered.
M’Cola motioned with his left hand and counted four fingers.
It was one of those lying down in the tall grass and the animal did look much bigger and the horns much more sweeping.
But we were looking into the morning sun and it was hard to see well.
Behind them a sort of gully ran up into the hill that blocked the end of the valley.
Now we knew what we had to do.
We must go back, cross the meadow far enough down so we were out of sight, get into the timber on the far side and work along through the timber to get above the sable.
First we must try to make sure there were no more of them in the timber or the meadow that we must work through before we made our stalk.
I wet my finger and put it up.
From the cool side it seemed as though the breeze came down the valley.
M’Cola took some dead leaves and crumpled them and tossed them up.
They fell a little toward us.
The wind was all right and now we must glass the edge of the timber and check on it.
‘Hapana,’ M’Cola said finally.
I had seen nothing either and my eyes ached from the pull of the eight-power glasses.
We could take a chance on the timber.
We might jump something and spook the sable but we had to take that chance to get around and above them.
We made our way back and down and told the others.
From where they were we could cross the valley out of[Pg 245] sight of its upper end and bending low, me with my hat off, we headed down into the high meadow grass and across the deeply cut watercourse that ran down through the centre of the meadow, across its rocky shelf, and up the grassy bank on the other side, keeping under the edge of a fold of the valley into the shelter of the woods.
Then we headed up through the woods, crouched, in single file, to try to get above the sable.
We went forward making as good time as we could and still move quietly.
I had made too many stalks on big horn sheep only to find them fed away and out of sight when you came round the shoulder of the mountain to trust these sable to stay where they were and, since once we were in the timber we could no longer see them, I thought it was important that we come up above them as fast as we could without getting me too blown and shaky for the shooting.
M’Cola’s water bottle made a noise against the cartridges in his pocket and I stopped and had him pass it to the Wanderobo-Masai.
It seemed too many people to be hunting with, but they all moved quietly as snakes, and I was over-confident anyway.
I was sure the sable could not see us in the forest, nor wind us.
Finally I was certain we were above them and that they must be ahead of us, and past where the sun was shining in a thinning of the forest, and below us, under the edge of the hill.
I checked on the aperture in the sight being clean, cleaned my glasses and wiped the sweat from my forehead remembering to put the used handkerchief in my left pocket so I would not fog my[Pg 246] glasses wiping them with it again.
M’Cola and I and the husband started to work our way to the edge of the timber; finally crawling almost to the edge of the ridge.
There were still some trees between us and the open meadow below and we were behind a small bush and a fallen tree when, raising our heads, we could see them in the grassy open, about three hundred yards away, showing big and very dark in the shadow.
Between us was scattered open timber full of sunlight and the openness of the gulch.
As we watched two got to their feet and seemed to be standing looking at us.
The shot was possible but it was too long to be certain and as I lay, watching, I felt somebody touch me on the arm and Garrick, who had crawled up, whispered throatily, ‘Piga! Piga, B’wana! Doumi! Doumi!’ saying to shoot, that it was a bull.
I glanced back and there were the whole outfit on their bellies or hands and knees, the Wanderobo-Masai shaking like a bird dog.
I was furious and motioned them all down.
So that was a bull, eh, well there was a much bigger bull that M’Cola and I had seen lying down.
The two sable were watching us and I dropped my head, I thought they might be getting a flash from my glasses.
When I looked up again, very slowly, I shaded my eyes with my hand.
The two sable had stopped looking and were feeding.
But one looked up again nervously and I saw the dark, heavy-built antelope with scimitar-like horns swung back staring at us.
I had never seen a sable.
I knew nothing about them, neither whether their eyesight was keen, like a ram who[Pg 247] sees you at whatever distance you see him, or like a bull elk who cannot see you at two hundred yards unless you move.
I was not sure of their size either, but I judged the range to be all of three hundred yards.
I knew I could hit one if I shot from a sitting position or prone, but I could not say where I would hit him.
Then Garrick again, ‘Piga, B’wana, Piga!’ I turned on him as though to slug him in the mouth.
It would have been a great comfort to do it.
I truly was not nervous when I first saw the sable, but Garrick was making me nervous.
‘Far?’ I whispered to M’Cola who had crawled up and was lying by me.
‘Yes.
‘Shoot?’.
‘No.
Glasses.
We both watched, using the glasses guardedly.
I could only see four.
There had been seven.
If that was a bull that Garrick pointed out, then they were all bulls.
They all looked the same colour in the shadow.
Their horns all looked big to me.
I knew that with mountain sheep the rams all kept together in bunches until late in the winter when they went with the ewes; that in the late summer you found bull elk in bunches too, before the rutting season, and that later they herded up together again.
We had seen as many as twenty impalla rams together upon the Serenea.
All right, then, they could all be bulls, but I wanted a good one, the best one, and I tried to remember having read something about them, but all I could remember was a silly story of some man seeing the same[Pg 248] bull every morning in the same place and never getting up on him.
All I could remember was the wonderful pair of horns we had seen in the Game Warden’s office in Arusha.
And here were sable now, and I must play it right and get the best one.
It never occurred to me that Garrick had never seen a sable and that he knew no more about them than M’Cola or I.
‘Too far,’ I said to M’Cola.
‘Yes.
‘Come on,’ I said, then waved the others down, and we started crawling up to reach the edge of the hill.
Finally we lay behind a tree and I looked around it.
Now we could see their horns clearly with the glasses and could see the other three.
One, lying down, was certainly much the biggest and the horns, as I caught them in silhouette, seemed to curve much higher and farther back.
I was studying them, too excited to be happy as I watched them, when I heard M’Cola whisper ‘B’wana.
I lowered the glasses and looked and there was Garrick, taking no advantage of the cover, crawling on his hands and knees out to join us.
I put my hand out, palm toward him, and waved him down but he paid no attention and came crawling on, as conspicuous as a man walking down a city street on hands and knees.
I saw one sable looking toward us, toward him, rather.
Then three more got to their feet.
Then the big one got up and stood broadside with head turned toward us as Garrick came up whispering, ‘Piga, B’wana! Piga! Doumi! Doumi! Kubwa Sana.
There was no choice now.
They were definitely[Pg 249] spooked and I lay out flat on my belly, put my arm through the sling, got my elbows settled and my right toe pushing the ground and squeezed off on the centre of the bull’s shoulder.
But at the roar I knew it was bad.
I was over him.
They all jumped and stood looking, not knowing where the noise came from.
I shot again at the bull and threw dirt all over him and they were off.
I was on my feet and hit him as he ran and he was down.
Then he was up and I hit him again and he took it and was in the bunch.
They passed him and I shot and was behind him.
Then I hit him again and he was trailing slowly and I knew I had him.
M’Cola was handing me cartridges and I was shoving shells down into the damned-to-hell, lousy, staggered, Springfield magazine watching the sable making heavy weather of it crossing the watercourse.
We had him all right.
I could see he was very sick.
The others were trailing up into the timber.
In the sunlight on the other side they looked much lighter and the one I’d shot looked lighter, too.
They looked a dark chestnut and the one I had shot was almost black.
But he was not black and I felt there was something wrong.
I shoved the last shell in and Garrick was trying to grab my hand to congratulate me when, below us across the open space where the gully that we could not see opened on to the head of the valley, sable started to pass at a running stampede.
‘Good God,’ I thought.
They all looked like the one I had shot and I was trying to pick a big one.
They all looked about the same and they were crowding running and then came the bull.
Even in the shadow he was a[Pg 250] dead black and shiny as he hit the sun, and his horns swept up high, then back, huge and dark, in two great curves nearly touching the middle of his back.
He was a bull all right.
God, what a bull.
‘Doumi,’ said M’Cola in my ear.
‘Doumi!’.
I hit him and at the roar he was down.
I saw him up, the others passing, spreading out, then bunching.
I missed him.
Then I saw him going almost straight away up the valley in the tall grass and I hit him again and he went out of sight.
The sable now were going up the hill at the head of the valley, up the hill at our right, up the hill in the timber across the valley, spread out and travelling fast.
Now that I had seen a bull I knew they all were cows including the first one I had shot.
The bull never showed and I was absolutely sure that we would find him where I had seen him go down in the long grass.
The outfit were all up and I shook off handshaking and thumb pulling before we started down through the trees and over the edge of the gully and to the meadow on a dead run.
My eyes, my mind, and all inside of me were full of the blackness of that sable bull and the sweep of those horns and I was thanking God I had the rifle reloaded before he came out.
But it was excited shooting, all of it, and I was not proud of it.
I had gotten excited and shot at the whole animal instead of the right place and I was ashamed; but the outfit now were drunk excited.
I would have walked but you could not hold them, they were like a pack of dogs as we ran.
As we crossed the meadow opening where we had first seen the[Pg 251] seven and went beyond where the bull had gone out of sight, the grass suddenly was high and over our heads and every one slowed down.
There were two washed-out concealed ravines ten or twelve feet deep that ran down to the watercourse and what had looked a smooth grass-filled basin was very broken, tricky country with grass that was from waist-high to well above our heads.
We found blood at once and it led off to the left, across the watercourse and up the hillside on the left toward the head of the valley.
I thought that was the first sable but it seemed a wider swing than he had seemed to make when we watched him going from above in the timber.
I made a circle to look for the big bull but I could not pick his track from the mass of tracks and in the high grass and the broken terrain it was difficult to figure just where he had gone.
They were all for the blood spoor and it was like trying to make badly-trained bird dogs hunt a dead bird when they are crazy to be off after the rest of the covey.
‘Doumi! Doumi!’ I said.
‘Kubwa Sana! The bull.
The big bull.
‘Yes,’ everybody agreed.
‘Here! Here!’ The blood spoor that crossed the watercourse.
Finally I took that trail thinking we must get them one at a time, and knowing this one was hard hit and the other would keep.
Then, too, I might be wrong and this might be the big bull, he might possibly have turned in the high grass and crossed here as we were running down.
I had been wrong before, I remembered.
We trailed fast up the hillside, into the timber, the[Pg 252] blood was splashed freely; made a turn toward the right, climbing steeply, and at the head of the valley in some large rocks jumped a sable.
It went scrambling and bounding off through the rocks.
I saw in an instant that it was not hit and knew that, in spite of the back-swung dark horns, it was a cow from the dark chestnut colour.
But I saw this just in time to keep from shooting.
I had started to pull when I lowered the rifle.
‘Manamouki,’ I said.
‘It’s a cow.
M’Cola and the two Roman guides agreed.
I had very nearly shot.
We went on perhaps five yards and another sable jumped.
But this one was swaying its head wildly and could not clear the rocks.
It was hard hit and I took my time, shot carefully, and broke its neck.
We came up to it, lying in the rocks, a large, deep chestnut-brown animal, almost black, the horns black and curving handsomely back, there was a white patch on the muzzle and back from the eye, there was a white belly; but it was no bull.
M’Cola, still in doubt, verified this and feeling the short, rudimentary teats said ‘Manamouki’, and shook his head sadly.
It was the first big bull that Garrick had pointed out.
‘Bull down there,’ I pointed.
‘Yes,’ said M’Cola.
I thought that we would give him time to get sick, if he were only wounded, and then go down and find him.
So I had M’Cola make the cuts for taking off the head skin and we would leave the old man to skin out the head while we went down after the bull.
[Pg 253]I drank some water from the canteen.
I was thirsty after the run and the climb, and the sun was up now and it was getting hot.
Then we went down the opposite side of the valley from that we had just come up trailing the wounded cow, and below, in the tall grass, casting in circles, commenced to hunt for the trail of the bull.
We could not find it.
The sable had been running in a bunch as they came out and any individual track was confused or obliterated.
We found some blood on the grass stems where I had first hit him, then lost it, then found it again where the other blood spoor turned off.
Then the tracks had all split up as they had gone, fan-wise, up the valley and the hills and we could not find it again.
Finally I found blood on a grass blade about fifty yards up the valley and I plucked it and held it up.
This was a mistake.
I should have brought them to it.
Already everyone but M’Cola was losing faith in the bull.
He was not there.
He had disappeared.
He had vanished.
Perhaps he had never existed.
Who could say he was a real bull? If I had not plucked the grass with the blood on it I might have held them.
Growing there with blood on it, it was evidence.
Plucked, it meant nothing except to me and to M’Cola.
But I could find no more blood and they were all hunting half-heartedly now.
The only possible way was to quarter every foot of the high grass and trace every foot of the gullies.
It was very hot now and they were only making a pretence of hunting.
Garrick came up.
‘All cows,’ he said.
‘No bull.
Just[Pg 254] biggest cow.
You killed biggest cow.
We found her.
Smaller cow get away.
‘You wind-blown son of a bitch,’ I said, then, using my fingers.
‘Listen.
Seven cows.
Then fifteen cows and one bull.
Bull hit.
Here.
‘All cows,’ said Garrick.
‘One big cow hit.
One bull hit.
I was so sure sounding that they agreed to this and searched for a while but I could see they were losing belief in the bull.
‘If I had one good dog,’ I thought.
‘Just one good dog.
Then Garrick came up.
‘All cows,’ he said.
‘Very big cows.
‘You’re a cow,’ I said.
‘Very big cow.
This got a laugh from the Wanderobo-Masai, who was getting to look a picture of sick misery.
The brother half believed in the bull, I could see.
Husband, by now, did not believe in any of us.
I didn’t think he even believed in the kudu of the night before.
Well, after this shooting, I did not blame him.
M’Cola came up.
‘Hapana,’ he said glumly.
Then, ‘B’wana, you shot that bull?’.
‘Yes,’ I said.
For a minute I began to doubt whether there ever was a bull.
Then I saw again his heavy, high-withered blackness and the high rise of his horns before they swept back, him running with the bunch, shoulder higher than them and black as hell and as I saw it, M’Cola saw it again too through the rising mist of the savage’s unbelief in what he can no longer see.
[Pg 255]‘Yes,’ M’Cola agreed.
‘I see him.
You shoot him.
I told it again.
‘Seven cows.
Shoot biggest.
Fifteen cows, one bull.
Hit that bull.
They all believed it now for a moment and circled, searching, but the faith died at once in the heat of the sun and the tall grass blowing.
‘All cows,’ Garrick said.
The Wanderobo-Masai nodded, his mouth open.
I could feel the comfortable lack of faith coming over me too.
It was a damned sight easier not to hunt in that sun in that shadeless pocket and in the sun on that steep hillside.
I told M’Cola we would hunt up the valley on both sides, finish skinning out the head, and he and I would come down alone and find the bull.
You could not hunt them against that unbelief.
I had had no chance to train them; no power to discipline.
If there had been no law I would have shot Garrick and they would all have hunted or cleared out.
I think they would have hunted.
Garrick was not popular.
He was simply poison.
M’Cola and I came back down the valley, quartered it like bird dogs, circled and followed and checked track after track.
I was hot and very thirsty.
The sun was something serious by now.
‘Hapana,’ M’Cola said.
We could not find him.
Whatever he was, we had lost him.
‘Maybe he was a cow.
Maybe it was all goofy,’ I thought, letting the unbelief come in as a comfort.
We were going to hunt up the hill side to the right and then we would have checked it all and would take the cow head into camp and see what the Roman had located.
[Pg 256] I was dead thirsty and drained the canteen.
We would get water in camp.
We started up the hill and I jumped a sable in some brush.
I almost loosed off at it before I saw it was a cow.
That showed how one could be hidden, I thought.
We would have to get the men and go over it all again; and then, from the old man, came a wild shouting.
‘Doumi! Doumi!’ in a high, screaming shout.
‘Where?’ I shouted, running across the hill toward him.
‘There! There!’ he shouted, pointing into the timber on the other side of the head of the valley.
‘There! There! There he goes! There!’.
We came on a dead run but the bull was out of sight in the timber on the hillside.
The old man said he was huge, he was black, he had great horns, and he came by him ten yards away, hit in two places, in the gut and high up in the rump, hard hit but going fast, crossing the valley, through the boulders and going up the hillside.
I gut-shot him, I thought.
Then as he was going away I laid that one on his stern.
He lay down and was sick and we missed him.
Then, when we were past, he jumped.
‘Come on,’ I said.
Everyone was excited and ready to go now and the old man was chattering about the bull as he folded the head skin and put the head upon his own head and we started across through the rocks and up, quartering up on to the hillside.
There, where the old man had pointed, was a very big sable track, the hoof marks spread wide, the tracks grading up into the timber and there was blood, plenty of it.
[Pg 257]We trailed him fast, hoping to jump him and have a shot, and it was easy trailing in the shade of the trees with plenty of blood to follow.
But he kept climbing, grading up around the hill, and he was travelling fast.
We kept the blood bright and wet but we could not come up on him.
I did not track but kept watching ahead thinking I might see him as he looked back, or see him down, or cutting down across the hill through the timber, and M’Cola and Garrick were tracking, aided by every one but the old man who staggered along with the sable skull and head skin held on his own grey head.
M’Cola had hung the empty water bottle on him, and Garrick had loaded him with the cinema camera.
It was hard going for the old man.
Once we came on a place where the bull had rested and watched his back track, there was a little pool of blood on a rock where he had stood, behind some bushes, and I cursed the wind that blew our scent on ahead of us.
There was a big breeze blowing now and I was certain we had no chance of surprising him, our scent would keep everything moving out of the way ahead of us as long as anything could move.
I thought of trying to circle ahead with M’Cola and let them track but we were moving fast, the blood was still bright on the stones and on the fallen leaves and grass and the hills were too steep for us to make a circle.
I did not see how we could lose him.
Then he took us up and into a rocky, ravine-cut country where the trailing was slow and the climbing difficult.
Here, I thought, we would jump him in a gully[Pg 258] but the spatters of blood, not so bright now, went on around the boulders, over the rocks and up and up and left us on a rim-rock ledge.
He must have gone down from there.
It was too steep above for him to have gone over the top of the hill.
There was no other way to go but down, but how had he gone, and down which ravine? I sent them looking down three possible ways and got out on the rim to try to sight him.
They could not find any spoor, and then the Wanderobo-Masai called from below and to the right that he had blood and, climbing down, we saw it on a rock and then followed it in occasional drying splatters down through a steep descent to the meadow below.
I was encouraged when he started down hill and in the knee-high, heavy grass of the meadow trailing was easy again, because the grass brushed against his belly and while you could not see tracks clearly without stooping double and parting the grass to look, yet the blood spoor was plain on the grass blades.
But it was dry now and dully shiny and I knew we had lost much time on him when he rim-rocked us on the hill.
Finally his trail crossed the dry watercourse about where we had first come in sight of the meadow in the morning and led away into the sloping, sparsely-wooded country on the far side.
There were no clouds and I could feel the sun now, not just as heat but as a heavy deadly weight on my head and I was very thirsty.
It was very hot but it was not the heat that bothered.
It was the weight of the sun.
Garrick had given up tracking seriously and was only contributing theatrical successes of discovering blood[Pg 259] when M’Cola and I were checked.
He would do no routine tracking any more, but would rest and then track in irritating spurts.
The Wanderobo-Masai was useless as a blue-jay and I had M’Cola give him the big rifle to carry so that we would get some use out of him.
The Roman’s brother was obviously not a hunter and the husband was not very interested.
He did not seem to be a hunter either.
As we trailed, slowly, the ground, hard now as the sun had baked it, the blood only black spots and splatters on the short grass, one by one the brother, Garrick, and the Wanderobo-Masai dropped out and sat in the shade of the scattered trees.
The sun was terrific and as it was necessary to track with heads bent down and stooping, in spite of a handkerchief spread over my neck I had a pounding ache in my head.
M’Cola was tracking slowly, steadily, and absolutely absorbed in the problem.
His bare, bald head gleamed with sweat and when it ran down in his eyes he would pluck a grass stem, hold it with each hand and shave the sweat off his forehead and bald black crown with the stem.
We went on slowly.
I had always sworn to Pop that I could out-track M’Cola but I realized now that in the past I had been giving a sort of Garrick performance in picking up the spoor when it was lost and that in straight, steady trailing, now in the heat, with the sun really bad, truly bad so that you could feel what it was doing to your head, cooking it to hell, trailing in short grass on hard ground where a blood spot was a dry, black blister on a[Pg 260] grass blade, difficult to see; that you must find the next little black spot perhaps twenty yards away, one holding the last blood while the other found the next, then going on, one on each side of the trail; pointing with a grass stem at the spots to save talking, until it ran out again and you marked the last blood with your eye and both made casts to pick it up again, signalling with a hand up, my mouth too dry to talk, a heat shimmer over the ground now when you straightened up to let your neck stop aching and looked ahead, I knew M’Cola was immeasurably the better man and the better tracker.
Have to tell Pop, I thought.
At this point M’Cola made a joke.
My mouth was so dry that it was hard to talk.
‘B’wana,’ M’Cola said, looking at me when I had straightened up and was leaning my neck back to get the crick out of it.
‘Yes?’.
‘Whisky?’ and he offered me the flask.
‘You bastard,’ I said in English, and he chuckled and shook his head.
‘Hapana whisky?’.
‘You savage,’ I said in Swahili.
We started tracking again, M’Cola shaking his head and very amused, and in a little while the grass was longer and it was easier again.
We crossed all that semi-open country we had seen from the hillside in the morning and going down a slope the tracks swung back into high grass.
In this higher grass I found that by half shutting my eyes I could see his trail where he had[Pg 261] shouldered through the grass and I went ahead fast without trailing by the blood, to M’Cola’s amazement, but then we came out on very short grass and rock again and now the trailing was the hardest yet.
He was not bleeding much now; the sun and the heat must have dried the wounds and we found only an occasional small starry splatter on the rocky ground.
Garrick came up and made a couple of brilliant discoveries of blood spots, then sat down under a tree.
Under another tree I could see the poor old Wanderobo-Masai holding his first and last job as gun-bearer.
Under another was the old man, the sable head beside him like some black-mass symbol, his equipment hanging from his shoulders.
M’Cola and I went on trailing very slowly and laboriously across the long stony slope and back and up into another tree-scattered meadow, and through it, and into a long field with piled up boulders at the end.
In the middle of this field we lost the trail completely and circled and hunted for nearly two hours before we found blood again.
The old man found it for us below the boulders and to the right half a mile away.
He had gone ahead down there on his own idea of what the bull would have done.
The old man was a hunter.
Then we trailed him very slowly, on to hard stony ground a mile away.
But we could not trail from there.
The ground was too hard to leave a track and we never found blood again.
Then we hunted on our various theories of where the bull would go, but the country was too big and we had no luck.
[Pg 262]‘No good,’ M’Cola said.
I straightened up and went over to the shade of a big tree.
It felt cool as water and the breeze cooled my skin through the wet shirt.
I was thinking about the bull and wishing to God I had never hit him.
Now I had wounded him and lost him.
I believe he kept right on travelling and went out of that country.
He never showed any tendency to circle back.
To-night he would die and the hyenas would eat him, or, worse, they would get him before he died, hamstringing him and pulling his guts out while he was alive.
The first one that hit that blood spoor would stay with it until he found him.
Then he would call up the others.
I felt a son of a bitch to have hit him and not killed him.
I did not mind killing anything, any animal, if I killed it cleanly, they all had to die and my interference with the nightly and the seasonal killing that went on all the time was very minute and I had no guilty feeling at all.
We ate the meat and kept the hides and horns.
But I felt rotten sick over this sable bull.
Besides, I wanted him, I wanted him damned badly, I wanted him more than I would admit.
Well, we had played our string out with him.
Our chance was at the start when he was down and we missed him.
We had lost that.
No, our best chance, the only chance a rifleman should ever ask, was when I had a shot and shot at the whole animal instead of calling the shot.
It was my own lousy fault.
I was a son of a bitch to have gut-shot him.
It came from over-confidence in being able to do a thing and then omitting one of the steps in how it is done.
Well, we had lost him.
I doubted if there was a dog in the[Pg 263] world could trail him now in that heat.
Still that was the only chance.
I got out the dictionary and asked the old man if there were any dogs at the Roman’s place.
‘No,’ said the old man.
‘Hapana.
We made a very wide circle and I sent the brother and the husband out in another circle.
We found nothing, no trace, no tracks, no blood, and I told M’Cola we would start for camp.
The Roman’s brother and the husband went up the valley to get the meat of the sable cow we had shot.
We were beaten.
M’Cola and I ahead, the other following, we went across the long heat haze of the open country, down to cross the dry watercourse, and up and into the grateful shade of the trail through the woods.
As we were going along through the broken sunlight and shadow, the floor of the forest smooth and springy where we cut across to save distance from the trail, we saw, less than a hundred yards away, a herd of sable standing in the timber looking at us.
I pulled back the bolt and looked for the best pair of horns.
‘Doumi,’ Garrick whispered.
‘Doumi kubwa sana!’.
I looked where he pointed.
It was a very big cow sable, dark chestnut, white marks on the face, white belly, heavy built and with a fine curving pair of horns.
She was standing broadside to us with her head turned, looking.
I looked carefully at the whole lot.
They were all cows; evidently the bunch whose bull I had wounded and lost, and they had come over the hill and herded up again together here.
‘We go to camp,’ I said to M’Cola.
[Pg 264]As we started forward the sable jumped and ran past us, crossing the trail ahead.
At every good pair of cow horns, Garrick said, ‘Bull, B’wana.
Big, big bull.
Shoot, B’wana.
Shoot, oh shoot!’.
‘All cows,’ I said to M’Cola when they were past, running in a panic through the sun-splashed timber.
‘Yes,’ he agreed.
‘Old man,’ I said.
The old man came up.
‘Let the guide carry that,’ I said.
The old man lowered the cow sable head.
‘No,’ said Garrick.
‘Yes,’ I said.
‘Bloody well yes.
We went on through the woods toward camp.
I was feeling better, much better.
All through the day I had never thought once of the kudu.
Now we were coming home to where they were waiting.
It seemed much longer coming home although, usually, the return over a new trail is shorter.
I was tired all the way into my bones, my head felt cooked, and I was thirstier than I had ever been in my life.
But suddenly, walking through the woods, it was much cooler.
A cloud had come over the sun.
We came out of the timber and down on to the flat and in sight of the thorn fence.
The sun was behind a bank of clouds now and then in a little while the sky was covered completely and the clouds looked heavy and threatening.
I thought perhaps this had been the last clear hot day; unusual heat before the rains.
First I thought: if it had only rained, so that the ground would hold a track, we could have stayed with that bull for ever;[Pg 265] then, looking at the heavy, woolly clouds that so quickly had covered all the sky, I thought that if we were going to join the outfit, and get the car across that ten-mile stretch of black cotton road on the way to Handeni, we had better start.
I pointed to the sky.
‘Bad,’ M’Cola agreed.
‘Go to the camp of B’wana M’Kubwa?’.
‘Better.
’ Then, vigorously, accepting the decision, ‘N’Dio.
N’Dio.
‘We go,’ I said.
Arrived at the thorn fence and the hut, we broke camp fast.
There was a runner there from our last camp who had brought a note, written before P.
and Pop had left, and bringing my mosquito net.
There was nothing in the note, only good luck and that they were starting.
I drank some water from one of our canvas bags, sat on a petrol tin and looked at the sky.
I could not, conscientiously, chance staying.
If it rained here we might not even be able to get out to the road.
If it rained heavily on the road, we would never get out to the coast that season.
Both the Austrian and Pop had said that, I had to go.
That was settled, so there was no use to think how much I wanted to stay.
The day’s fatigue helped make the decision easy.
Everything was being loaded into the car and they were all gathering up their meat from the sticks around the ashes of the fire.
‘Don’t you want to eat, B’wana?’ Kamau asked me.
‘No,’ I said.
Then in English, ‘Too bloody tired.
‘Eat.
You are hungry.
[Pg 266]‘Later, in the car.
M’Cola went by with a load, his big, flat face completely blank again.
It only came alive about hunting or some joke.
I found a tin cup by the fire and called to him to bring the whisky, and the blank face cracked at the eyes and mouth into a smile as he took the flask out of his pocket.
‘With water better,’ he said.
‘You black Chinaman.
They were all working fast and the Roman’s women came over and stood a little way away watching the carrying and the packing of the car.
There were two of them, good-looking, well built, and shy, but interested.
The Roman was not back yet.
I felt very badly to go off like this with no explanation to him.
I liked the Roman very much and had a high regard for him.
I took a drink of the whisky and water and looked at the two pairs of kudu horns that leaned against the wall of the chicken coop hut.
From the white, cleanly picked skulls the horns rose in slow spirals that spreading made a turn, another turn, and then curved delicately into those smooth, ivory-like points.
One pair was narrower and taller against the side of the hut.
The other was almost as tall but wider in spread and heavier in beam.
They were the colour of black walnut meats and they were beautiful to see.
I went over and stood the Springfield against the hut between them and the tips reached past the muzzle of the rifle.
As Kamau came back from carrying a load to the car I told him to bring the camera and then had him stand beside them while I took a[Pg 267] picture.
Then he picked them up, each head a load, and carried them over to the car.
Garrick was talking loudly and in a roostery way to the Roman’s women.
As near as I could make out he was offering them the empty petrol boxes in exchange for a piece of something.
‘Come here,’ I called to him.
He came over still feeling smart.
‘Listen,’ I told him in English.
‘If I get through this safari without socking you it’s going to be a bloody marvel.
And if I ever hit you I’ll break your mucking jaw.
That’s all.
He did not understand the words but the tone made it clearer than if I had got something out of the dictionary to tell him.
I stood up and motioned to the women that they could have the petrol tins and the cases.
I was damned if I could not have anything to do with them if I would let Garrick make any passes.
‘Get in the car,’ I told him.
‘No,’ as he started to make delivery of one of the petrol tins, ‘in the car.
’ He went over to the car.
We were all packed now and ready to go.
The horns were curling out the back of the car, tied on to the loads.
I left some money for the Roman and one of the kudu hides with the boy.
Then we got in the car.
I got in the front seat with the Wanderobo-Masai.
Behind were M’Cola, Garrick, and the runner, who was a man from the old man’s village by the road.
The old man was crouched on top of the loads at the back, close under the roof.
[Pg 268]We waved and started, passing more of the Roman’s household, the older and uglier part, roasting up piles of meat by a log fire beside the trail that came up from the river through the maize field.
We made the crossing all right, the creek was down and the banks had dried and I looked back at the field, the Roman’s huts, and the stockade where we had camped, and the blue hills, dark under the heavy sky, and I felt very badly not to have seen the Roman and explain why we had gone off like this.
Then we were going through the woods, following our trail and trying to make time to get out before dark.
We had trouble, twice, at boggy places and Garrick seemed to be in a state of great hysteria, ordering people about when we were cutting brush and shovelling, until I was certain I would have to hit him.
He called for corporal punishment the way a showing-off child does for a spanking.
Kamau and M’Cola were both laughing at him.
He was playing the victorious leader home from the chase now.
I thought it was really a shame that he could not have his ostrich plumes.
Once when we were stuck and I was shovelling and he was stooping over in a frenzy of advice and command-giving, I brought the handle of the shovel, with manifest un-intention, up hard into his belly and he sat down, backwards.
I never looked toward him, and M’Cola, Kamau, and I could not look at each other for fear we would laugh.
‘I am hurt,’ he said in astonishment, getting to his feet.
[Pg 269]‘Never get near a man shovelling,’ I said in English.
‘Damned dangerous.
‘I am hurt,’ said Garrick holding his belly.
‘Rub it,’ I told him and rubbed mine to show him how.
We all got into the car again and I began to feel sorry for the poor, bloody, useless, theatrical bastard, so I told M’Cola I would drink a bottle of beer.
He got one out from under the loads in the back, we were going through the deer-park-looking country now, opened it, and I drank it slowly.
I looked around and saw Garrick was all right now, letting his mouth run freely again.
He rubbed his belly and seemed to be telling them what a hell of a man he was and how he had never felt it.
I could feel the old man watching me from up under the roof as I drank the beer.
‘Old man,’ I said.
‘Yes, B’wana.
‘A present,’ and I handed what was left in the bottle back.
There wasn’t much left but the foam and a very little beer.
‘Beer?’ asked M’Cola.
‘By God, yes,’ I said.
I was thinking about beer and in my mind was back to that year in the spring when we walked on the mountain road to the Bains de Alliez and the beer-drinking contest where we failed to win the calf and came home that night around the mountain with the moonlight on the fields of narcissi that grew on the meadows, and how we were drunk and talked about how you would describe that light on that paleness, and the brown beer sitting at the wood tables under the[Pg 270] wistaria vine at Aigle when we came in across the Rhone Valley from fishing the Stockalper with the horse chestnut trees in bloom, and Chink and I again discussing writing and whether you could call them waxen candelabras.
God, what bloody literary discussions we had; we were literary as hell then just after the war, and later there was the good beer at Lipp’s at midnight after Mascart-Ledoux at the Cirque de Paris or Routis-Ledoux, or after any other great fight where you lost your voice and were still too excited to turn in; but beer was mostly those years just after the war with Chink and in the mountains.
Flags for the Fusilier, crags for the Mountaineer, for English poets beer, strong beer for me.
That was Chink then, quoting Robert Graves, then.
We outgrew some countries and we went to others but beer was still a bloody marvel.
The old man knew it too.
I had seen it in his eye the first time he saw me take a drink.
‘Beer,’ said M’Cola.
He had it open, and I looked out at that park-like country, the engine hot under my boots, the Wanderobo-Masai as strong as ever beside me, Kamau watching the grooves of the tyre tracks in the green turf, and I hung my booted legs over the side to let my feet cool and drank the beer and wished old Chink was along.
Captain Eric Edward Dorman-Smith, M.
, of His Majesty’s Fifth Fusiliers.
Now if he were here we could discuss how to describe this deer-park country and whether deer-park was enough to call it.
Pop and Chink were much alike.
Pop was older and more tolerant for his years and the same sort of company.
I was learning under Pop, while Chink and I had discovered a big[Pg 271] part of the world together and then our ways had gone a long way apart.
But that damned sable bull.
I should have killed him; but it was a running shot.
To hit him at all I had to use him all as a target.
Yes, you bastard, but what about the cow you missed twice, prone, standing broadside? Was that a running shot? No.
If I’d gone to bed last night I would not have done that.
Or if I’d wiped out the bore to get the oil out she would not have thrown high the first time.
Then I would not have pulled down and shot under her the second shot.
Every damned thing is your own fault if you’re any good.
I thought I could shoot a shot-gun better than I could and I had lost plenty of money backing my opinion, but I knew, coldly, and outside myself, that I could shoot a rifle on game as well as any son of a bitch that ever lived.
Like hell I could.
So what? So I gut-shot a sable bull and let him get away.
Could I shoot as well as I thought I could? Sure.
Then why did I miss on that cow? Hell, everybody is off sometime.
You’ve got no bloody business to be off.
Who the hell are you? My conscience? Listen, I’m all right with my conscience.
I know just what kind of a son of a bitch I am and I know what I can do well.
If I hadn’t had to leave and pull out I would have got a sable bull.
You know the Roman was a hunter.
There was another herd.
Why did I have to make a one-night stand? Was that any way to hunt? Hell, no.
I’d make some money some way and when we came back we would come to the old man’s village in lorries, then pack in with porters so there wouldn’t be any damned car to[Pg 272] worry about, send the porters back, and make a camp in the timber up the stream above the Roman’s and hunt that country slowly, living there and hunting out each day, sometimes laying off and writing for a week, or writing half the day, or every other day, and get to know it as I knew the country around the lake where we were brought up.
I’d see the buffalo feeding where they lived, and when the elephants came through the hills we would see them and watch them breaking branches and not have to shoot, and I would lie in the fallen leaves and watch the kudu feed out and never fire a shot unless I saw a better head than this one in the back, and instead of trailing that sable bull, gut-shot to hell, all day, I’d lie behind a rock and watch them on the hillside and see them long enough so they belonged to me for ever.
Sure, if Garrick didn’t take his B’wana Simba car in there and shoot the country out.
But if he did I’d go on down beyond those hills and there would be another country where a man could live and hunt if he had time to live and hunt.
They’d gone in wherever a car could go.
But there must be pockets like this all over, that no one knows of, that the cars pass all along the road.
They all hunt the same places.
‘Beer?’ asked M’Cola.
‘Yes,’ I said.
Sure, you couldn’t make a living.
Everyone had explained that.
The locusts came and ate your crops and the monsoon failed, and the rains did not come, and everything dried up and died.
There were ticks and fly to kill the stock, and the mosquitoes gave you fever and[Pg 273] maybe you got blackwater.
Your cattle would die and you would get no price for your coffee.
It took an Indian to make money from sisal and on the coast every coconut plantation meant a man ruined by the idea of making money from copra.
A white hunter worked three months out of the year and drank for twelve and the Government was ruining the country for the benefit of the Hindu and the natives.
That was what they told you.
Sure.
But I did not want to make money.
All I wanted was to live in it and have time to hunt.
Already I had had one of the diseases and had experienced the necessity of washing a three-inch bit of my large intestine with soap and water and tucking it back where it belonged an unnumbered amount of times a day.
There were remedies which cured this and it was well worth going through for what I had seen and where I had been.
Besides I caught that on the dirty boat out from Marseilles.
hadn’t been ill a day.
Neither had Karl.
I loved this country and I felt at home and where a man feels at home, outside of where he’s born, is where he’s meant to go.
Then, in my grandfather’s time, Michigan was a malaria ridden state.
They called it fever and ague.
And in Tortugas, where I’d spent months, a thousand men once died of yellow fever.
New continents and islands try to frighten you with disease as a snake hisses.
The snake may be poisonous too.
You kill them off.
Hell, what I had a month ago would have killed me in the old days before they invented the remedies.
Maybe it would and maybe I would have got well.
It is easier to keep well in a good country by taking[Pg 274] simple precautions than to pretend that a country which is finished is still good.
A continent ages quickly once we come.
The natives live in harmony with it.
But the foreigner destroys, cuts down the trees, drains the water, so that the water supply is altered, and in a short time the soil, once the sod is turned under, is cropped out, and next it starts to blow away as it has blown away in every old country and as I had seen it start to blow in Canada.
The earth gets tired of being exploited.
A country wears out quickly unless man puts back in it all his residue and that of all his beasts.
When he quits using beasts and uses machines the earth defeats him quickly.
The machine can’t reproduce, nor does it fertilize the soil, and it eats what he cannot raise.
A country was made to be as we found it.
We are the intruders and after we are dead we may have ruined it but it will still be there and we don’t know what the next changes are.
I suppose they all end up like Mongolia.
I would come back to Africa but not to make a living from it.
I could do that with two pencils and a few hundred sheets of the cheapest paper.
But I would come back to where it pleased me to live; to really live.
Not just to let my life pass.
Our people went to America because that was the place to go then.
It had been a good country and we had made a mess of it and I would go, now, somewhere else as we had always had the right to go somewhere else and as we had always gone.
You could always come back.
Let the others come to America who did not know that they had come too late.
Our[Pg 275] people had seen it at its best and fought for it when it was well worth fighting for.
Now I would go somewhere else.
We always went in the old days and there were still good places to go.
I knew a good country when I saw one.
Here there was game, plenty of birds, and I liked the natives.
Here I could shoot and fish.
That, and writing, and reading, and seeing pictures was all I cared about doing.
And I could remember all the pictures.
Other things I liked to watch but they were what I liked to do.
That and ski-ing.
But my legs were bad now and it was not worth the time you spent hunting good snow any more.
You saw too many people ski-ing now.
Now, the car making a turn around a bank and crossing a green, grassy field, we came in sight of the Masai village.
When the Masai saw us they started running and we stopped, surrounded by them, just below the stockade.
There were the young warriors who had run with us, and now their women and the children all came out to see us.
The children were all quite young and the men and women all seemed the same age.
There were no old people.
They all seemed to be our great friends and we gave a very successful party with refreshments in the shape of our bread which they all ate with much laughing, the men first, then the women.
Then I had M’Cola open the two cans of mincemeat and the plum pudding and I cut these into rations and passed them out.
I had heard and read that the Masai subsisted only on the blood of their cattle mixed with milk, drawing the blood off[Pg 276] from a wound in a vein of the neck made by shooting an arrow at close range.
These Masai, however, ate bread, cold mincemeat, and plum pudding with great relish and much laughter and joking.
One very tall and handsome one kept asking me something that I did not understand and then five or six more joined in.
Whatever this was they wanted it very badly.
Finally the tallest one made a very strange face and emitted a sound like a dying pig.
I understood finally: he was asking if we had one of those, and I pressed the button of the klaxon.
The children ran screaming, the warriors laughed and laughed, and then as Kamau, in response to popular demand, pressed the klaxon again and again, I watched the look of utter rapture and ecstasy on the women’s faces and knew that with that klaxon he could have had any woman in the tribe.
Finally we had to go and after distributing the empty beer bottles, the labels from the bottles, and finally the bottle caps, picked up by M’Cola from the floor, we left, klaxoning the women into ecstasy, the children into panic, and the warriors into delight.
The warriors ran with us for a good way but we had to make time, the going was good through the park-like country and, in a little while, we waved to the last of them standing straight and tall, in their brown skin garments, their clubbed pig-tails hanging, their faces stained a red-brown, leaning on their spears, looking after us and smiling.
The sun was almost down and as I did not know the road I had the runner get up in front to sit with the Wanderobo-Masai and help direct Kamau and I sat in the[Pg 277] back with M’Cola and Garrick.
We were out of the park country and on to the dry bush-spattered plain before the sun went down and I had another bottle of the German beer and, watching the country, saw, suddenly, that all the trees were full of white storks.
I did not know whether they were there in migration or were following the locusts but, in the twilight, they were lovely to see and, deeply moved by them, I gave the old man a good two fingers of beer that was left in the bottom of the bottle.
On the next bottle I forgot and drank it all before I remembered the old man.
(There were still storks in the trees and we saw some Grant’s gazelles feeding off to the right.
A jackal, like a grey fox, trotted across the road.
) So I told M’Cola to open another bottle and we were through the plain and climbing the long slope toward the road and the village, the two mountains in sight now, and it almost dark and quite cold when I handed the bottle to the old man, who took it where he was crouched up under the roof, and nursed it tenderly.
At the village we stopped in the road in the dark, and I paid the runner the amount it said to give him in the note he had brought.
I paid the old man the amount Pop said to pay him and a bonus.
Then there was a big dispute among them all.
Garrick was to go to the main camp to get his money.
Abdullah insisted upon going along.
He did not trust Garrick.
The Wanderobo-Masai insisted pitifully that he go.
He was sure the others would cheat him out of his share and I was fairly sure they would, too.
There was petrol that had been left[Pg 278] for us to use in case we were short and for us to bring in any event.
We were overloaded and I did not know how the road was ahead.
But I thought we might carry Abdullah and Garrick and squeeze in the Wanderobo-Masai.
There was no question of the old man going.
He had been paid off and had agreed to the amount, but now he would not leave the car.
He crouched on top of the load and hung on to the ropes saying, ‘I am going with B’wana’.
M’Cola and Kamau had to break his handholds and pull him off to re-load, him shouting, ‘I want to go with B’wana!’.
While they were loading in the dark he held on to my arm and talked very quietly in a language that I could not understand.
‘You have the shillings,’ I said.
‘Yes, B’wana,’ he said.
That was not what it was about.
The money was all right.
Then, when we started to get in the car he broke away and started to climb up through the back and on to the loads.
Garrick and Abdullah pulled him down.
‘You can’t go.
There isn’t room.
He talked to me softly again, begging and pleading.
‘No, there is no room.
I remembered I had a small penknife and I got it out of my pocket and put it in his hand.
He pushed it back in my hand.
‘No,’ he said.
‘No.
He was quiet then and stood by the road.
But when we started, he started to run after the car and I could[Pg 279] hear him in the dark screaming, ‘B’wana! I want to go with B’wana!’.
We went on up the road, the headlights making it seem like a boulevard after where we had been.
We drove fifty-five miles on that road in the dark night without incident.
I stayed awake until after we were through the bad part, a long plain of deeply rutted black cotton where the headlights picked out the trail through bushes and then, when the road was better, I went to sleep, waking occasionally to see the headlights shining on a wall of tall trees, or a naked bank, or when we ground in low gear up a steep place, the light slanting up ahead.
Finally, when the speedometer showed fifty miles, we stopped and woke a native in his hut and M’Cola asked about the camp.
I slept again and then woke as we were turning off the road and on a track through trees with the fires of the camp showing ahead.
Then as we came to where our lights shone on the green tents I shouted and we all commenced to shout and blew the klaxon and I let the gun off, the flame cutting up into the dark and it making a great noise.
Then we were stopped and out from Pop’s tent I saw him coming, thick and heavy in his dressing-gown, and then he had his arms around my shoulders and said, ‘You god damned bull fighter’, and I was clapping him on the back.
And I said, ‘Look at them, Pop’.
‘I saw them,’ he said.
‘The whole back of the car’s full of them.
Then I was holding P.
tight, she feeling very[Pg 280] small inside the quilted bigness of the dressing-gown, and we were saying things to each other.
Then Karl came out and I said, ‘Hi, Karl’.
‘I’m so damned glad,’ he said.
‘They’re marvellous.
M’Cola had the horns down by now and he and Kamau were holding them so they could all see them in the light of the fire.
‘What did you get?’ I asked Karl.
‘Just another one of those.
What do you call them? Tendalla.
‘Swell,’ I said.
I knew I had one no one could beat and I hoped he had a good one too.
‘How big was he?’.
‘Oh, fifty-seven,’ Karl said.
‘Let’s see him,’ I said, cold in the pit of my stomach.
‘He’s over there,’ Pop said, and we went over.
They were the biggest, widest, darkest, longest-curling, heaviest, most unbelievable pair of kudu horns in the world.
Suddenly, poisoned with envy, I did not want to see mine again; never, never.
‘That’s great,’ I said, the words coming out as cheerfully as a croak.
I tried it again.
‘That’s swell.
How did you get him?’.
‘There were three,’ Karl said.
‘They were all as big as that.
I couldn’t tell which was the biggest.
We had a hell of a time.
I hit him four or five times.
‘He’s a wonder,’ I said.
I was getting so I could do it a little better but it would not fool anybody yet.
‘I’m awfully glad you got yours,’ Karl said.
‘They’re beauties.
I want to hear all about them in the morning.
I know you’re tired to-night.
Good night.
[Pg 281]He went off, delicate as always, so we could talk about it if we wanted to.
‘Come on over and have a drink,’ I called.
‘No thanks, I think I better go to bed.
I’ve got a sort of headache.
‘Good night, Karl.
‘Good night.
Good night, Poor Old Mamma,’.
‘Good night,’ we all said.
By the fire, with whisky and soda, we talked and I told them about it all.
‘Perhaps they’ll find the bull,’ Pop said.
‘We’ll offer a reward for the horns.
Have them sent to the Game Department.
How big is your biggest one?’.
‘Fifty-two.
‘Over the curve?’.
‘Yes.
Maybe he’s a little better.
‘Inches don’t mean anything,’ Pop said.
‘They’re damned wonderful kudu.
‘Sure.
But why does he have to beat me so bloody badly?’.
‘He’s got the luck,’ Pop said.
‘God, what a kudu.
I’ve only seen one head killed over fifty in my life before.
That was up on Kalal.
‘We knew he had it when we left the other camp.
The lorry came in and told us,’ P.
said.
‘I’ve spent all my time praying for you.
Ask Mr.
‘You’ll never know what it meant to see that car come into the firelight with those damned horns sticking out,’ Pop said.
‘You old bastard.
‘It’s wonderful,’ P.
said.
‘Let’s go and look at them again.
[Pg 282]‘You can always remember how you shot them.
That’s what you really get out of it,’ Pop said.
‘They’re damned wonderful kudu.
But I was bitter and I was bitter all night long.
In the morning, though, it was gone.
It was all gone and I have never had it again.
Pop and I were up and looking at the heads before breakfast.
It was a grey, overcast morning and cold.
The rains were coming.
‘They’re three marvellous kudu,’ he said.
‘They look all right with the big one this morning,’ I said.
They did, too, strangely enough.
I had accepted the big one now and was happy to see him and that Karl had him.
When you put them side by side they looked all right.
They really did.
They all were big.
‘I’m glad you’re feeling better,’ Pop said.
‘I’m feeling better myself.
‘I’m really glad he has him,’ I said truly.
‘Mine’ll hold me.
‘We have very primitive emotions,’ he said.
‘It’s impossible not to be competitive.
Spoils everything, though.
‘I’m all through with that,’ I said.
‘I’m all right again.
I had quite a trip, you know.
‘Did you not,’ said Pop.
‘Pop, what does it mean when they shake hands and get hold of your thumb and pull it?’.
‘It’s on the order of blood brotherhood but a little less formal.
Who’s been doing that to you?’.
‘Everybody but Kamau.
[Pg 283]‘You’re getting to be a hell of a fellow,’ Pop said.
‘You must be an old timer out here.
Tell me, are you much of a tracker and bird shot?’.
‘Go to hell.
‘M’Cola has been doing that with you too?’.
‘Yes.
‘Well, well,’ said Pop.
‘Let’s get the little Memsahib and have some breakfast.
Not that I’m feeling up to it.
‘I am,’ I said.
‘I haven’t eaten anything since day before yesterday.
‘Drank some beer though, didn’t you?’.
‘Ah, yes.
‘Beer’s a food,’ Pop said.
We got the little Memsahib and old Karl and had a very jolly breakfast.
A month later P.
, Karl, and Karl’s wife who had come out and joined us at Haifa, were sitting in the sun against a stone wall by the Sea of Galilee eating some lunch and drinking a bottle of wine and watching the grebes out on the lake.
The hills made shadows on the water, which was flat calm and rather stagnant looking.
There were many grebes, making spreading wakes in the water as they swam, and I was counting them and wondering why they never were mentioned in the Bible.
I decided that those people were not naturalists.
‘I’m not going to walk on it,’ Karl said, looking out at the dreary lake.
‘It’s been done already.
‘You know,’ P.
said, ‘I can’t remember it.
I can’t remember Mr.
’s face.
And he’s beautiful.
[Pg 284] I think about him and think about him and I can’t see him.
It’s terrible.
He isn’t the way he looks in a photograph.
In a little while I won’t be able to remember him at all.
Already I can’t see him.
‘You must remember him,’ Karl said to her.
‘I can remember him,’ I said.
‘I’ll write you a piece some time and put him in.

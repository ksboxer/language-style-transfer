The lunatic , the lover , and the poet , Are of imagination all compact .
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold ; That is the madman .
The lover , all as frantic , Sees Helen 's beauty in a brow of Egypt .
Such tricks hath strong imagination That , if it would but apprehend some joy , It comprehends some bringer of that joy ; Or in the night , imagining some fear , How easy is a bush supposed a bear ?
But all the story of the night told over , And all their minds transfigured so together , More witnesseth than fancy 's images , And grows to something of great constancy , But howsoever strange and admirable .
Here come the lovers , full of joy and mirth .
Joy , gentle friends , joy and fresh days of love Accompany your hearts !
More than to us Wait in your royal walks , your board , your bed !
Come now ; what masques , what dances shall we have , To wear away this long age of three hours Between our after-supper and bed-time ?
Where is our usual manager of mirth ?
What revels are in hand ?
Is there no play To ease the anguish of a torturing hour ?
Call Philostrate .
Say , what abridgment have you for this evening ?
What masque ?
what music ?
How shall we beguile The lazy time , if not with some delight ?
There is a brief how many sports are ripe ; Make choice of which your Highness will see first .
tedious and brief !
That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow .
How shall we find the concord of this discord ?
What are they that do play it ?
Hard-handed men that work in Athens here , Which never labour 'd in their minds till now ; And now have toil 'd their unbreathed memories With this same play against your nuptial .
And we will hear it .
No , my noble lord , It is not for you .
I have heard it over , And it is nothing , nothing in the world ; Unless you can find sport in their intents , Extremely stretch 'd and conn 'd with cruel pain , To do you service .
I will hear that play ; For never anything can be amiss When simpleness and duty tender it .
I love not to see wretchedness o 'er-charged , And duty in his service perishing .
Why , gentle sweet , you shall see no such thing .
He says they can do nothing in this kind .
The kinder we , to give them thanks for nothing .
Our sport shall be to take what they mistake ; And what poor duty cannot do , noble respect Takes it in might , not merit .
Trust me , sweet , Out of this silence yet I picked a welcome ; And in the modesty of fearful duty I read as much as from the rattling tongue Of saucy and audacious eloquence .
Love , therefore , and tongue-tied simplicity In least speak most to my capacity .
So please your Grace , the Prologue is address 'd .
Let him approach .
If we offend , it is with our good will .
That you should think , we come not to offend , But with good will .
To show our simple skill , That is the true beginning of our end .
Consider then , we come but in despite .
We do not come , as minding to content you , Our true intent is .
All for your delight We are not here .
He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt ; he knows not the stop .
Indeed he hath play 'd on this prologue like a child on a recorder , — a sound , but not in government .
His speech was like a tangled chain ; nothing impaired , but all disordered .
Who is next ?
Gentles , perchance you wonder at this show ; But wonder on , till truth make all things plain .
This man is Pyramus , if you would know ; This beauteous lady Thisbe is certain .
This man , with lanthorn , dog , and bush of thorn , Presenteth Moonshine ; for , if you will know , By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn To meet at Ninus ' tomb , there , there to woo .
This grisly beast , which Lion hight by name , The trusty Thisbe , coming first by night , Did scare away , or rather did affright ; And as she fled , her mantle she did fall ; Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain .
For all the rest , Let Lion , Moonshine , Wall , and lovers twain , At large discourse while here they do remain .
I wonder if the lion be to speak .
Would you desire lime and hair to speak better ?
It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse , my lord .
Pyramus draws near the wall ; silence .
O grim-look 'd night !
O night with hue so black !
O night , which ever art when day is not !
Thanks , courteous wall .
Jove shield thee well for this !
But what see I ?
No Thisbe do I see .
O wicked wall , through whom I see no bliss , Curs 'd he thy stones for thus deceiving me !
The wall , methinks , being sensible , should curse again .
No , in truth , sir , he should not .
Deceiving me is Thisbe 's cue .
She is to enter now , and I am to spy her through the wall .
You shall see it will fall pat as I told you ; yonder she comes .
O wall , full often hast thou heard my moans , For parting my fair Pyramus and me !
I see a voice ; now will I to the chink , To spy an I can hear my Thisbe 's face .
Thisbe !
My love !
thou art my love , I think .
Think what thou wilt , I am thy lover 's grace ; And like Limander am I trusty still .
And I like Helen , till the Fates me kill .
Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true .
As Shafalus to Procrus , I to you .
O , kiss me through the hole of this vile wall .
I kiss the wall 's hole , not your lips at all .
Wilt thou at Ninny 's tomb meet me straightway ?
Tide life , ' tide death , I come without delay .
Thus have I , wall , my part discharged so ; And , being done , thus Wall away doth go .
Now is the mural down between the two neighbors .
No remedy , my lord , when walls are so wilful to hear without warning .
This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard .
The best in this kind are but shadows ; and the worst are no worse , if imagination amend them .
It must be your imagination then , and not theirs .
If we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves , they may pass for excellent men .
Here come two noble beasts in , a man and a lion .
You , ladies , you , whose gentle hearts do fear The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor , May now , perchance , both quake and tremble here , When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar .
A very gentle beast , and of a good conscience .
The very best at a beast , my lord , that e 'er I saw .
This lion is a very fox for his valour .
True ; and a goose for his discretion .
Not so , my lord ; for his valour cannot carry his discretion , and the fox carries the goose .
His discretion , I am sure , cannot carry his valour ; for the goose carries not the fox .
He is no crescent , and his horns are invisible within the circumference .
This lanthorn doth the horned moon present ; Myself the man i ' the moon do seem to be .
How is it else the man i ' the moon ?
He dares not come there for the candle ; for , you see , it is already in snuff .
I am aweary of this moon .
Would he would change !
It appears , by his small light of discretion , that he is in the wane ; but yet , in courtesy , in all reason , we must stay the time .
Proceed , Moon .
All that I have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon ; I , the man i ' the moon ; this thorn-bush , my thorn-bush ; and this dog , my dog .
Why , all these should be in the lantern ; for all these are in the moon .
But silence ; here comes Thisbe .
This is old Ninny 's tomb .
Where is my love ?
Well run , Thisbe .
Well moused , Lion .
And then came Pyramus .
And so the lion vanished .
But stay , O spite !
But mark , poor knight , What dreadful dole is here !
Eyes , do you see ?
How can it he ?
O dainty duck !
O dear !
Thy mantle good , What !
stain 'd with blood ?
Approach , ye Furies fell .
O Fates !
come , come ; Cut thread and thrum ; Quail , crush , conclude , and quell .
This passion , and the death of a dear friend , would go near to make a man look sad .
Beshrew my heart , but I pity the man .
O wherefore , Nature , didst thou lions frame ?
Since lion vile hath here deflower 'd my dear ; Which is — no , no — which was the fairest dame That lived , that loved , that liked , that looked with cheer .
Come , tears , confound ; Out , sword , and wound The pap of Pyramus ; Ay , that left pap , Where heart doth hop .
Thus die I , thus , thus , thus .
Now am I dead , Now am I fled ; My soul is in the sky .
Now die , die , die , die , die .
No die , but an ace , for him ; for he is but one .
Less than an ace , man ; for he is dead ; he is nothing .
With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and yet prove an ass .
How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes back and finds her lover ?
A mote will turn the balance , which Pyramus , which Thisbe , is the better , — he for a man , God warrant us : She for a woman , God bless us !
She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes .
And thus she moans , videlicet : — Asleep , my love ?
What , dead , my dove ?
O Pyramus , arise , Speak , speak .
Quite dumb ?
Dead , dead ?
A tomb Must cover thy sweet eyes .
O Sisters Three , Come , come to me , With hands as pale as milk ; Lay them in gore , Since you have shore With shears his thread of silk .
Dies &ket; &bra; Dies &ket; Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead .
Ay , and Wall too .
No , I assure you ; the wall is down that parted their fathers .
Will it please you to see the epilogue , or to hear a Bergomask dance between two of our company ?
No epilogue , I pray you ; for your play needs no excuse .
Never excuse ; for when the players are all dead there need none to be blamed .
Marry , if he that writ it had played Pyramus , and hanged himself in Thisbe 's garter , it would have been a fine tragedy .
And so it is , truly ; and very notably discharged .
But come , your Bergomask ; let your epilogue alone .
I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn , As much as we this night have overwatch 'd .
Through the house give glimmering light , By the dead and drowsy fire ; Every elf and fairy sprite Hop as light as bird from brier ; And this ditty , after me , Sing and dance it trippingly .
Now , until the break of day , Through this house each fairy stray .
To the best bride-bed will we , Which by us shall blessed be ; And the issue there create Ever shall be fortunate .
Trip away ; make no stay ; Meet me all by break of day .
If we shadows have offended , Think but this , and all is mended , That you have but slumber 'd here While these visions did appear .
And this weak and idle theme , No more yielding but a dream , Gentles , do not reprehend .
So , good night unto you all .
Give me your hands , if we be friends , And Robin shall restore amends .
Tush , never tell me !
I take it much unkindly That thou , Iago , who hast had my purse As if the strings were thine , shouldst know of this .
Sblood , but you will not hear me .
If ever I did dream of such a matter , Abhor me .
Thou told 'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate .
Despise me , if I do not .
By heaven , I rather would have been his hangman .
Why , there 's no remedy .
Tis the curse of service , Preferment goes by letter and affection , And not by old gradation , where each second Stood heir to the first .
Now , sir , be judge yourself Whether I in any just term am affined To love the Moor .
I would not follow him then .
You shall mark Many a duteous and kneecrooking knave , That doting on his own obsequious bondage Wears out his time , much like his master 's ass , For naught but provender ; and , when he 's old , cashier 'd .
Whip me such honest knaves .
Others there are , Who , trimm 'd in forms and visages of duty , Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves , And throwing but shows of service on their lords Do well thrive by them ; and when they have lined their coats Do themselves homage .
These fellows have some soul , And such a one do I profess myself .
For , sir , It is as sure as you are Roderigo , Were I the Moor , I would not be Iago .
What a full fortune does the thicklips owe , If he can carry 't thus !
Though that his joy be joy , Yet throw such changes of vexation on 't As it may lose some color .
Do ; with like timorous accent and dire yell As when , by night and negligence , the fire Is spied in populous cities .
What , ho , Brabantio !
Signior Brabantio , ho !
Awake !
What , ho , Brabantio !
thieves !
thieves !
thieves !
Look to your house , your daughter , and your bags !
Thieves !
thieves !
What is the reason of this terrible summons ?
What is the matter there ?
Signior , is all your family within ?
Are your doors lock 'd ?
Arise , I say !
What , have you lost your wits ?
Most reverend signior , do you know my voice ?
What are you ?
My name is Roderigo .
The worser welcome .
Sir , sir , sir — But thou must needs be sure My spirit and my place have in them power To make this bitter to thee .
Patience , good sir .
What tell 'st thou me of robbing ?
This is Venice ; My house is not a grange .
Most grave Brabantio , In simple and pure soul I come to you .
Zounds , sir , you are one of those that will not serve God , if the devil bid you .
Because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians , you 'll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse ; you 'll have your nephews neigh to you ; you 'll have coursers for cousins , and gennets for germans .
What profane wretch art thou ?
I am one , sir , that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs .
Thou art a villain .
You are — a senator .
Sir , I will answer any thing .
Give me a taper !
Call up all my people !
Farewell , for I must leave you .
It seems not meet , nor wholesome to my place , To be produced — as , if I stay , I shall — Against the Moor .
That you shall surely find him , Lead to the Sagittary the raised search , And there will I be with him .
So farewell .
How didst thou know ' twas she ?
Raise all my kindred .
Are they married , think you ?
Truly , I think they are .
O heaven ! — How got she out ?
O treason of the blood !
Fathers , from hence trust not your daughters ' minds By what you see them act .
Have you not read , Roderigo , Of some such thing ?
Yes , sir , I have indeed .
Call up my brother .
Do you know Where we may apprehend her and the Moor ?
I think I can discover him , if you please To get good guard , and go along with me .
Pray you , lead on .
Though in the trade of war I have slain men , Yet do I hold it very stuff o ' the conscience To do no contrived murder .
I lack iniquity Sometimes to do me service .
Nine or ten times I had thought to have yerk 'd him here under the ribs .
Tis better as it is .
Nay , but he prated And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms Against your honor That , with the little godliness I have , I did full hard forbear him .
But I pray you , sir , Are you fast married ?
Be assured of this , That the magnifico is much beloved , And hath in his effect a voice potential As double as the Duke 's .
He will divorce you , Or put upon you what restraint and grievance The law , with all his might to enforce it on , Will give him cable .
Let him do his spite .
My services , which I have done the signiory , Shall out-tongue his complaints .
But , look !
What lights come yond ?
Those are the raised father and his friends .
You were best go in .
Is it they ?
By Janus , I think no .
The goodness of the night upon you , friends !
What is the news ?
The Duke does greet you , general , And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance , Even on the instant .
What is the matter , think you ?
The galleys Have sent a dozen sequent messengers This very night at one another 's heels ; And many of the consuls , raised and met , Are at the Duke 's already .
You have been hotly call 'd for ; When , being not at your lodging to be found , The Senate hath sent about three quests To search you out .
Tis well I am found by you .
I will but spend a word here in the house And go with you .
Ancient , what makes he here ?
I do not understand .
He 's married .
To who ?
Marry , to — Come , captain , will you go ?
Have with you .
Here comes another troop to seek for you .
It is Brabantio . — General , be advised ; He comes to bad intent .
Holla !
Stand there !
Signior , it is the Moor .
You , Roderigo !
Come , sir , I am for you .
O thou foul thief , where hast thou stow 'd my daughter ?
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee For an abuser of the world , a practicer Of arts inhibited and out of warrant . — Lay hold upon him .
If he do resist , Subdue him at his peril .
To prison ; till fit time Of law and course of direct session , Call thee to answer .
What if I do obey ?
How may the Duke be therewith satisfied , Whose messengers are here about my side , Upon some present business of the state To bring me to him ?
Tis true , most worthy signior ; The Duke 's in council , and your noble self , I am sure , is sent for .
How ?
The Duke in council ?
The Duke himself , Or any of my brothers of the state , Cannot but feel this wrong as ' twere their own ; For if such actions may have passage free , Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be .
There is no composition in these news That gives them credit .
Indeed they are disproportion 'd ; My letters say a hundred and seven galleys .
And mine , a hundred and forty .
And mine , two hundred .
What , ho !
What , ho !
What , ho !
A messenger from the galleys .
Now , what 's the business ?
The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes ; So was I bid report here to the state By Signior Angelo .
How say you by this change ?
Nay , in all confidence , he 's not for Rhodes .
Here is more news .
The Ottomites , reverend and gracious , Steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes , Have there injointed them with an after fleet .
Ay , so I thought .
How many , as you guess ?
Signior Montano , Your trusty and most valiant servitor , With his free duty recommends you thus , And prays you to believe him .
Tis certain then for Cyprus .
Marcus Luccicos , is not he in town ?
He 's now in Florence .
Write from us to him , postposthaste dispatch .
Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor .
Valiant Othello , we must straight employ you Against the general enemy Ottoman .
I did not see you ; welcome , gentle signior ; We lack 'd your counsel and your help tonight .
So did I yours .
Why , what 's the matter ?
My daughter !
O , my daughter !
Dead ?
Whoe 'er he be that in this foul proceeding Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself And you of her , the bloody book of law You shall yourself read in the bitter letter After your own sense .
Humbly I thank your Grace .
Here is the man , this Moor ; whom now , it seems , Your special mandate for the state affairs Hath hither brought .
We are very sorry for 't .
What in your own part can you say to this ?
Nothing , but this is so .
Yet , by your gracious patience , I will a round unvarnish 'd tale deliver Of my whole course of love : what drugs , what charms , What conjuration , and what mighty magic For such proceeding I am charged withal I won his daughter .
A maiden never bold ; Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion Blush 'd at herself ; and she — in spite of nature , Of years , of country , credit , everything — To fall in love with what she fear 'd to look on !
To vouch this , is no proof , Without more certain and more overt test Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods Of modern seeming do prefer against him .
But , Othello , speak .
Did you by indirect and forced courses Subdue and poison this young maid 's affections ?
Or came it by request , and such fair question As soul to soul affordeth ?
Fetch Desdemona hither .
Ancient , conduct them ; you best know the place .
And till she come , as truly as to heaven I do confess the vices of my blood , So justly to your grave ears I 'll present How I did thrive in this fair lady 's love And she in mine .
Say it , Othello .
Her father loved me , oft invited me , Still question 'd me the story of my life From year to year , the battles , sieges , fortunes , That I have pass 'd .
I did consent , And often did beguile her of her tears When I did speak of some distressful stroke That my youth suffer 'd .
This only is the witchcraft I have used .
Here comes the lady ; let her witness it .
I think this tale would win my daughter too .
My noble father , I do perceive here a divided duty .
To you I am bound for life and education ; My life and education both do learn me How to respect you ; you are the lord of duty , I am hitherto your daughter .
But here 's my husband , And so much duty as my mother show 'd To you , preferring you before her father , So much I challenge that I may profess Due to the Moor , my lord .
God be with you !
I have done .
For your sake , jewel , I am glad at soul I have no other child ; For thy escape would teach me tyranny , To hang clogs on them .
I have done , my lord .
Let me speak like yourself , and lay a sentence Which , as a grise or step , may help these lovers Into your favor .
When remedies are past , the griefs are ended By seeing the worst , which late on hopes depended .
To mourn a mischief that is past and gone Is the next way to draw new mischief on .
What cannot be preserved when fortune takes , Patience her injury a mockery makes .
The robb 'd that smiles steals something from the thief ; He robs himself that spends a bootless grief .
These sentences , to sugar or to gall , Being strong on both sides , are equivocal .
I humbly beseech you , proceed to the affairs of state .
The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus .
Othello , the fortitude of the place is best known to you ; and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency , yet opinion , a sovereign mistress of effects , throws a more safer voice on you .
You must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition .
The tyrant custom , most grave senators , Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war My thrice driven bed of down .
I do agnize A natural and prompt alacrity I find in hardness ; and do undertake These present wars against the Ottomites .
Most humbly therefore bending to your state , I crave fit disposition for my wife , Due reference of place and exhibition , With such accommodation and besort As levels with her breeding .
Nor I.
Nor I. I would not there reside To put my father in impatient thoughts By being in his eye .
Most gracious Duke , To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear .
What would you , Desdemona ?
That I did love the Moor to live with him , My downright violence and storm of fortunes May trumpet to the world .
So that , dear lords , if I be left behind , A moth of peace , and he go to the war , The rites for which I love him are bereft me , And I a heavy interim shall support By his dear absence .
Let me go with him .
Let her have your voices .
Tonight , my lord ?
This night .
With all my heart .
At nine i ' the morning here we 'll meet again .
Othello , leave some officer behind , And he shall our commission bring to you ; With such things else of quality and respect As doth import you .
Let it be so .
Good night to everyone .
And , noble signior , If virtue no delighted beauty lack , Your son-in-law is far more fair than black .
Adieu , brave Moor , use Desdemona well .
My life upon her faith !
Iago !
What say 'st thou , noble heart ?
What will I do , thinkest thou ?
Why , go to bed and sleep .
I will incontinently drown myself .
If thou dost , I shall never love thee after .
Why , thou silly gentleman !
It is silliness to live when to live is torment , and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician .
O villainous !
I have looked upon the world for four times seven years , and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury , I never found man that knew how to love himself .
Ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen , I would change my humanity with a baboon .
What should I do ?
I confess it is my shame to be so fond , but it is not in my virtue to amend it .
Virtue ?
a fig !
Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus .
If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality , the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions .
It cannot be .
It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will .
Come , be a man !
Drown thyself ?
Drown cats and blind puppies !
Put money in thy purse ; follow thou the wars ; defeat thy favor with an usurped beard .
It was a violent commencement , and thou shalt see an answer- able sequestration ; put but money in thy purse .
These Moors are changeable in their wills : — fill thy purse with money .
The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts , shall be to him shortly as acerb as the coloquintida .
If thou wilt needs damn thyself , do it a more delicate way than drowning .
A pox of drowning thyself !
It is clean out of the way .
Seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her .
Wilt thou be fast to my hopes , if I depend on the issue ?
I have told thee often , and I retell thee again and again , I hate the Moor .
My cause is hearted ; thine hath no less reason .
Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him .
If thou canst cuckold him , thou dost thyself a pleasure , me a sport .
There are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered .
Traverse , go , provide thy money .
We will have more of this tomorrow .
Adieu .
Where shall we meet i ' the morning ?
At my lodging .
I 'll be with thee betimes .
Go to , farewell .
Do you hear , Roderigo ?
What say you ?
No more of drowning , do you hear ?
Thus do I ever make my fool my purse ; For I mine own gain 'd knowledge should profane , If I would time expend with such a snipe But for my sport and profit .
I hate the Moor ; And it is thought abroad that ' twixt my sheets He has done my office .
I know not if 't be true ; But I for mere suspicion in that kind Will do as if for surety .
He holds me well ; The better shall my purpose work on him .
Cassio 's a proper man .
Let me see now : To get his place , and to plume up my will In double knavery — How , how ?
He hath a person and a smooth dispose To be suspected ; framed to make women false .
The Moor is of a free and open nature , That thinks men honest that but seem to be so ; And will as tenderly be led by the nose As asses are .
I have 't .
It is engender 'd .
Hell and night Must bring this monstrous birth to the world 's light .
What from the cape can you discern at sea ?
Nothing at all .
It is a highwrought flood ; I cannot , ' twixt the heaven and the main , Descry a sail .
What shall we hear of this ?
If that the Turkish fleet Be not enshelter 'd and embay 'd , they are drown 'd ; It is impossible to bear it out .
News , lads !
Our wars are done .
How ?
Is this true ?
I am glad on 't ; ' tis a worthy governor .
But this same Cassio , though he speak of comfort Touching the Turkish loss , yet he looks sadly And prays the Moor be safe ; for they were parted With foul and violent tempest .
Pray heavens he be ; For I have served him , and the man commands Like a full soldier .
Come , let 's do so ; For every minute is expectancy Of more arrivance .
Thanks , you the valiant of this warlike isle , That so approve the Moor !
O , let the heavens Give him defense against the elements , For I have lost him on a dangerous sea .
Is he well shipp 'd ?
His bark is stoutly timber 'd , and his pilot Of very expert and approved allowance ; Therefore my hopes , not surfeited to death , Stand in bold cure .
A sail , a sail , a sail !
What noise ?
The town is empty ; on the brow o ' the sea Stand ranks of people , and they cry , “ A sail ! ” My hopes do shape him for the governor .
I pray you , sir , go forth , And give us truth who ' tis that is arrived .
I shall .
But , good lieutenant , is your general wived ?
How now !
who has put in ?
Tis one Iago , ancient to the general .
What is she ?
She that I spake of , our great captain 's captain , Left in the conduct of the bold Iago ; Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts A se 'nnight 's speed .
O , behold , The riches of the ship is come on shore !
Ye men of Cyprus , let her have your knees .
Hail to thee , lady !
And the grace of heaven , Before , behind thee , and on every hand , Enwheel thee round !
I thank you , valiant Cassio .
What tidings can you tell me of my lord ?
He is not yet arrived ; nor know I aught But that he 's well and will be shortly here .
O , but I fear — How lost you company ?
The great contention of the sea and skies Parted our fellowship — But , hark !
a sail .
See for the news .
Good ancient , you are welcome .
Welcome , mistress .
Sir , would she give you so much of her lips As of her tongue she oft bestows on me , You 'ld have enough .
Alas , she has no speech .
In faith , too much ; I find it still when I have list to sleep : Marry , before your ladyship , I grant She puts her tongue a little in her heart And chides with thinking .
You have little cause to say so .
O , fie upon thee , slanderer !
You shall not write my praise .
No , let me not .
What wouldst thou write of me , if thou shouldst praise me ?
O gentle lady , do not put me to 't ; For I am nothing if not critical .
Ay , madam .
I am not merry , but I do beguile The thing I am by seeming otherwise .
Come , how wouldst thou praise me ?
I am about it ; but indeed my invention Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze ; It plucks out brains and all .
But my Muse labors , And thus she is deliver 'd .
If she be fair and wise , fairness and wit , The one 's for use , the other useth it .
Well praised !
How if she be black and witty ?
If she be black , and thereto have a wit , She 'll find a white that shall her blackness fit .
Worse and worse .
How if fair and foolish ?
She never yet was foolish that was fair ; For even her folly help 'd her to an heir .
These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i ' the alehouse .
What miserable praise hast thou for her that 's foul and foolish ?
Thou praisest the worst best .
But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed , one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself ?
To suckle fools and chronicle small beer .
O most lame and impotent conclusion !
Do not learn of him , Emilia , though he be thy husband .
How say you , Cassio ?
Is he not a most profane and liberal counselor ?
He speaks home , madam .
You may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar .
With as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as Cassio .
Ay , smile upon her , do ; I will gyve thee in thine own courtship .
You say true ; ' tis so , indeed .
If such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry , it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft , which now again you are most apt to play the sir in .
an excellent courtesy !
tis so , indeed .
Yet again your fingers to your lips ?
Would they were clysterpipes for your sake !
The Moor !
I know his trumpet .
Tis truly so .
Let 's meet him and receive him .
Lo , where he comes !
O my fair warrior !
My dear Othello !
It gives me wonder great as my content To see you here before me .
O my soul 's joy !
If after every tempest come such calms , May the winds blow till they have waken 'd death !
And let the laboring bark climb hills of seas Olympus high , and duck again as low As hell 's from heaven !
If it were now to die , ' Twere now to be most happy ; for I fear My soul hath her content so absolute That not another comfort like to this Succeeds in unknown fate .
The heavens forbid But that our loves and comforts should increase , Even as our days do grow !
Amen to that , sweet powers !
I cannot speak enough of this content ; It stops me here ; it is too much of joy : And this , and this , the greatest discords be They kiss .
O , you are well tuned now !
But I 'll set down the pegs that make this music , As honest as I am .
Come , let us to the castle .
News , friends : our wars are done , the Turks are drown 'd .
Honey , you shall be well desired in Cyprus ; I have found great love amongst them .
O my sweet , I prattle out of fashion , and I dote In mine own comforts .
Come , Desdemona , Once more well met at Cyprus .
Do thou meet me presently at the harbor .
Come hither .
If thou be 'st valiant — as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them — list me .
The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard .
First , I must tell thee this : Desdemona is directly in love with him .
With him ?
Why , ' tis not possible .
Lay thy finger thus , and let thy soul be instructed .
Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor , but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies .
And will she love him still for prating ?
Let not thy discreet heart think it .
Her eye must be fed ; and what delight shall she have to look on the devil ?
When the blood is made dull with the act of sport , there should be , again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite , loveliness in favor , sympathy in years , manners , and beauties ; all which the Moor is defec- tive in .
Now sir , this granted — as it is a most pregnant and unforced position — who stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does ?
A knave very voluble ; no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming , for the better com- passing of his salt and most hidden loose affection ?
I cannot believe that in her ; she 's full of most blest condition .
Blest fig 'send !
The wine she drinks is made of grapes .
If she had been blest , she would never have loved the Moor .
Blest pudding !
Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand ?
Didst not mark that ?
Yes , that I did ; but that was but courtesy .
Lechery , by this hand ; an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts .
They met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together .
Villainous thoughts , Roderigo !
When these mutualities so marshal the way , hard at hand comes the master and main exercise , the incorporate conclusion .
Pish !
But , sir , be you ruled by me .
I have brought you from Venice .
Cassio knows you not .
I 'll not be far from you .
Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio , either by speaking too loud , or tainting his discipline , or from what other course you please , which the time shall more favorably minister .
Provoke him , that he may ; for even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny , whose qual- ification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio .
So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them , and the impediment most profitably removed , with- out the which there were no expectation of our prosperity .
I warrant thee .
Meet me by and by at the citadel .
I must fetch his necessaries ashore .
Farewell .
Adieu .
So much was his pleasure should be proclaimed .
All offices are open , and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till the bell have told eleven .
Heaven bless the isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello !
Iago hath direction what to do ; But notwithstanding , with my personal eye Will I look to 't .
Iago is most honest .
Michael , good night .
Tomorrow with your earliest Let me have speech with you .
Come , my dear love , The purchase made , the fruits are to ensue ; That profit 's yet to come ' tween me and you .
Good night .
Welcome , Iago ; we must to the watch .
Not this hour , lieutenant ; ' tis not yet ten o ' the clock .
Our general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona ; who let us not therefore blame .
He hath not yet made wan- ton the night with her , and she is sport for Jove .
She 's a most exquisite lady .
And , I 'll warrant her , full of game .
Indeed she 's a most fresh and delicate creature .
What an eye she has !
Methinks it sounds a parley to provocation .
An inviting eye ; and yet methinks right modest .
And when she speaks , is it not an alarum to love ?
She is indeed perfection .
Well , happiness to their sheets !
Come , lieutenant , I have a stoup of wine , and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black Othello .
I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment .
O , they are our friends !
But one cup ; I 'll drink for you .
I have drunk but one cup tonight , and that was craftily qualified too , and behold what innovation it makes here .
I am unfortunate in the infirmity , and dare not task my weakness with any more .
What , man !
Where are they ?
Here at the door ; I pray you , call them in .
I 'll do 't , but it dislikes me .
If I can fasten but one cup upon him , With that which he hath drunk tonight already , He 'll be as full of quarrel and offense As my young mistress ' dog .
Now , ' mongst this flock of drunkards , Am I to put our Cassio in some action That may offend the isle .
Some wine , ho !
And let me the canakin clink , clink ; &bra; Sings .
Fore God , an excellent song .
I learned it in England , where indeed they are most potent in potting .
Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking ?
Why , he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk ; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain ; he gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled .
To the health of our general !
King Stephen was a worthy peer , His breeches cost him but a crown ; He held them sixpence all too dear , With that he call 'd the tailor lown .
Will you hear 't again ?
It 's true , good lieutenant .
For mine own part — no offense to the general , nor any man of quality — I hope to be saved .
And so do I too , lieutenant .
Let 's have no more of this ; let 's to our affairs .
God forgive us our sins !
Gentlemen , let 's look to our business .
I am not drunk now ; I can stand well enough , and I speak well enough .
Excellent well .
And do but see his vice ; ' Tis to his virtue a just equinox , The one as long as the other .
Tis pity of him .
I fear the trust Othello puts him in On some odd time of his infirmity Will shake this island .
But is he often thus ?
Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep ; He 'll watch the horologe a double set , If drink rock not his cradle .
It were well The general were put in mind of it .
How now , Roderigo !
I pray you , after the lieutenant ; go .
What noise ?
You rogue !
You rascal !
What 's the matter , lieutenant ?
A knave teach me my duty !
But I 'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle .
Beat me !
Nay , good lieutenant ; I pray you , sir , hold your hand .
Let me go , sir , or I 'll knock you o 'er the mazzard .
Come , come , you 're drunk .
Drunk !
What is the matter here ?
Zounds , I bleed still ; I am hurt to the death .
Hold , for your lives !
Hold , ho ! — Lieutenant — sir — Montano — gentlemen — Have you forgot all place of sense and duty ?
Hold !
Why , how now , ho !
from whence ariseth this ?
Are we turn 'd Turks , and to ourselves do that Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites ?
What is the matter , masters ?
Honest Iago , that look 'st dead with grieving , Speak , who began this ?
How comes it , Michael , you are thus forgot ?
I pray you , pardon me ; I cannot speak .
Worthy Montano , you were wont be civil ; The gravity and stillness of your youth The world hath noted , and your name is great In mouths of wisest censure .
What 's the matter , That you unlace your reputation thus , And spend your rich opinion for the name Of a nightbrawler ?
Give me answer to it .
Nor know I aught By me that 's said or done amiss this night ; Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice , And to defend ourselves it be a sin When violence assails us .
Now , by heaven , My blood begins my safer guides to rule , And passion , having my best judgement collied , Assays to lead the way .
If I once stir , Or do but lift this arm , the best of you Shall sink in my rebuke .
Give me to know How this foul rout began , who set it on , And he that is approved in this offense , Though he had twinn 'd with me , both at a birth , Shall lose me .
What !
in a town of war , Yet wild , the people 's hearts brimful of fear , To manage private and domestic quarrel , In night , and on the court and guard of safety !
Tis monstrous .
Iago , who began 't ?
If partially affined , or leagued in office , Thou dost deliver more or less than truth , Thou art no soldier .
Touch me not so near : I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth Than it should do offense to Michael Cassio ; Yet , I persuade myself , to speak the truth Shall nothing wrong him .
Thus it is , general .
Montano and myself being in speech , There comes a fellow crying out for help , And Cassio following him with determined sword , To execute upon him .
He , swift of foot , Outran my purpose ; and I return 'd the rather For that I heard the clink and fall of swords , And Cassio high in oath , which till tonight I ne 'er might say before .
When I came back — For this was brief — I found them close together , At blow and thrust , even as again they were When you yourself did part them .
More of this matter cannot I report .
I know , Iago , Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter , Making it light to Cassio .
Cassio , I love thee ; But never more be officer of mine .
Look , if my gentle love be not raised up !
I 'll make thee an example .
What 's the matter ?
All 's well now , sweeting ; come away to bed .
Sir , for your hurts , myself will be your surgeon .
Lead him off .
Iago , look with care about the town , And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted .
What , are you hurt , lieutenant ?
Ay , past all surgery .
Marry , heaven forbid !
Reputation , reputation , reputation !
O , I have lost my reputation !
I have lost the immortal part of myself , and what remains is bestial .
My reputation , Iago , my reputation !
As I am an honest man , I thought you had received some bodily wound ; there is more sense in that than in reputa- tion .
Reputation is an idle and most false imposition ; oft got without merit and lost without deserving .
You have lost no reputation at all , unless you repute yourself such a loser .
What , man !
there are ways to recover the general again .
You are but now cast in his mood , a punishment more in policy than in malice ; even so as one would beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious lion .
Sue to him again , and he 's yours .
I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight , so drunken , and so indiscreet an officer .
Drunk ?
and speak parrot ?
and squabble ?
swagger ?
swear ?
and discourse fustian with one 's own shadow ?
O thou invisible spirit of wine , if thou hast no name to be known by , let us call thee devil !
What was he that you followed with your sword ?
What had he done to you ?
I know not .
Is 't possible ?
I remember a mass of things , but nothing distinctly ; a quarrel , but nothing wherefore .
O God , that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains !
that we should , with joy , pleasance , revel , and applause , transform ourselves into beasts !
Why , but you are now well enough .
How came you thus recovered ?
Come , you are too severe a moraler .
As the time , the place , and the condition of this country stands , I could heartily wish this had not befallen ; but since it is as it is , mend it for your own good .
I will ask him for my place again ; he shall tell me I am a drunkard !
Had I as many mouths as Hydra , such an answer would stop them all .
To be now a sensible man , by and by a fool , and presently a beast !
O strange !
Every inordinate cup is unblest , and the ingredient is a devil .
Come , come , good wine is a good familiar creature , if it be well used .
Exclaim no more against it .
And , good lieutenant , I think you think I love you .
I have well approved it , sir .
I drunk !
You or any man living may be drunk at some time , man .
I 'll tell you what you shall do .
Confess yourself freely to her ; importune her help to put you in your place again .
She is of so free , so kind , so apt , so blessed a disposition , she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested .
This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter ; and , my fortunes against any lay worth naming , this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before .
You advise me well .
I protest , in the sincerity of love and honest kindness .
You are in the right .
Good night , lieutenant , I must to the watch .
Good night , honest Iago .
And what 's he then that says I play the villain ?
When this advice is free I give and honest , Probal to thinking , and indeed the course To win the Moor again ?
For ' tis most easy The inclining Desdemona to subdue In any honest suit .
She 's framed as fruitful As the free elements .
How am I then a villain To counsel Cassio to this parallel course , Directly to his good ?
Divinity of hell !
So will I turn her virtue into pitch , And out of her own goodness make the net That shall enmesh them all .
How now , Roderigo !
I do follow here in the chase , not like a hound that hunts , but one that fills up the cry .
How poor are they that have not patience !
What wound did ever heal but by degrees ?
Thou know 'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft , And wit depends on dilatory time .
Does 't not go well ?
By the mass , ' tis morning ; Pleasure and action make the hours seem short .
Retire thee ; go where thou art billeted : Away , I say .
Thou shalt know more hereafter : Nay , get thee gone .
Masters , play here , I will content your pains ; Something that 's brief ; and bid “ Good morrow , general . ” Why , masters , have your instruments been in Naples , that they speak i ' the nose thus ?
How , sir , how ?
Are these , I pray you , wind instruments ?
Ay , marry , are they , sir .
Whereby hangs a tale , sir ?
Marry , sir .
Well , sir , we will not .
We have none such , sir .
Then put up your pipes in your bag , for I 'll away .
Dost thou hear , my honest friend ?
No , I hear not your honest friend ; I hear you .
Prithee , keep up thy quillets .
There 's a poor piece of gold for thee .
If the gentlewoman that attends the general 's wife be stirring , tell her there 's one Cassio entreats her a little favor of speech .
Wilt thou do this ?
Do , good my friend .
In happy time , Iago .
You have not been abed , then ?
Why , no ; the day had broke Before we parted .
I have made bold , Iago , To send in to your wife .
My suit to her Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona Procure me some access .
I 'll send her to you presently ; And I 'll devise a mean to draw the Moor Out of the way , that your converse and business May be more free .
I humbly thank you for 't .
I never knew A Florentine more kind and honest .
The general and his wife are talking of it , And she speaks for you stoutly .
Yet , I beseech you , If you think fit , or that it may be done , Give me advantage of some brief discourse With Desdemona alone .
Pray you , come in .
I will bestow you where you shall have time To speak your bosom freely .
I am much bound to you .
Well , my good lord , I 'll do 't .
This fortification , gentlemen , shall we see 't ?
We 'll wait upon your lordship .
Be thou assured , good Cassio , I will do All my abilities in thy behalf .
O , that 's an honest fellow .
Do not doubt , Cassio , But I will have my lord and you again As friendly as you were .
Bounteous madam , Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio , He 's never anything but your true servant .
Ay , but , lady , That policy may either last so long , Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet , Or breed itself so out of circumstances , That I being absent and my place supplied , My general will forget my love and service .
My lord shall never rest ; I 'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience ; His bed shall seem a school , his board a shrift ; I 'll intermingle everything he does With Cassio 's suit .
Therefore be merry , Cassio , For thy solicitor shall rather die Than give thy cause away .
Madam , here comes my lord .
Madam , I 'll take my leave .
Nay , stay and hear me speak .
Madam , not now .
I am very ill at ease , Unfit for mine own purposes .
Well , do your discretion .
Ha !
I like not that .
What dost thou say ?
Was not that Cassio parted from my wife ?
Cassio , my lord !
No , sure , I cannot think it , That he would steal away so guiltylike , Seeing you coming .
I do believe ' twas he .
How now , my lord !
I have been talking with a suitor here , A man that languishes in your displeasure .
Who is 't you mean ?
Why , your lieutenant , Cassio .
Went he hence now ?
Ay , sooth ; so humbled , That he hath left part of his grief with me , To suffer with him .
Good love , call him back .
Not now , sweet Desdemona ; some other time .
But shall 't be shortly ?
The sooner , sweet , for you .
Shall 't be tonight at supper ?
No , not tonight .
Tomorrow dinner then ?
I shall not dine at home ; I meet the captains at the citadel .
In faith , he 's penitent ; And yet his trespass , in our common reason — Save that , they say , the wars must make examples Out of their best — is not almost a fault To incur a private check .
When shall he come ?
Tell me , Othello .
I wonder in my soul , What you would ask me , that I should deny , Or stand so mammering on .
What ?
Nay , when I have a suit — Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed , It shall be full of poise and difficult weight , And fearful to be granted .
Shall I deny you ?
No .
Farewell , my lord .
Emilia , come .
Be as your fancies teach you ; Whate 'er you be , I am obedient .
Excellent wretch !
Perdition catch my soul , But I do love thee !
and when I love thee not , Chaos is come again .
Did Michael Cassio , when you woo 'd my lady , Know of your love ?
He did , from first to last .
Why dost thou ask ?
But for a satisfaction of my thought ; No further harm .
Why of thy thought , Iago ?
I did not think he had been acquainted with her .
O , yes , and went between us very oft .
Indeed !
Indeed ?
ay , indeed .
Discern 'st thou aught in that ?
Is he not honest ?
Honest , my lord ?
Honest ?
Ay , honest .
My lord , for aught I know .
What dost thou think ?
Think , my lord ?
Think , my lord ?
By heaven , he echoes me , As if there were some monster in his thought Too hideous to be shown .
What didst not like ?
If thou dost love me , Show me thy thought .
My lord , you know I love you .
For Michael Cassio , I dare be sworn I think that he is honest .
I think so too .
Men should be what they seem ; Or those that be not , would they might seem none !
Certain , men should be what they seem .
Why then I think Cassio 's an honest man .
Utter my thoughts ?
Why , say they are vile and false ; As where 's that palace where in to foul things Sometimes intrude not ?
Who has a breast so pure , But some uncleanly apprehensions Keep leets and lawdays , and in session sit With meditations lawful ?
Thou dost conspire against thy friend , Iago , If thou but think 'st him wrong 'd and makest his ear A stranger to thy thoughts .
It were not for your quiet nor your good , Nor for my manhood , honesty , or wisdom , To let you know my thoughts .
What dost thou mean ?
By heaven , I 'll know thy thoughts .
You cannot , if my heart were in your hand ; Nor shall not , whilst ' tis in my custody .
Ha !
That cuckold lives in bliss Who , certain of his fate , loves not his wronger ; But O , what damned minutes tells he o 'er Who dotes , yet doubts , suspects , yet strongly loves !
O misery !
Why , why is this ?
Think 'st thou I 'ld make a life of jealousy , To follow still the changes of the moon With fresh suspicions ?
Exchange me for a goat , When I shall turn the business of my soul To such exsufflicate and blown surmises , Matching thy inference .
Tis not to make me jealous To say my wife is fair , feeds well , loves company , Is free of speech , sings , plays , and dances well ; Where virtue is , these are more virtuous .
Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt ; For she had eyes and chose me .
No , Iago , I 'll see before I doubt ; when I doubt , prove ; And on the proof , there is no more but this , Away at once with love or jealousy !
I am glad of it , for now I shall have reason To show the love and duty that I bear you With franker spirit .
Therefore , as I am bound , Receive it from me .
I speak not yet of proof .
Look to your wife ; observe her well with Cassio ; Wear your eye thus , not jealous nor secure .
I know our country disposition well ; In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks They dare not show their husbands ; their best conscience Is not to leave 't undone , but keep 't unknown .
Dost thou say so ?
She did deceive her father , marrying you ; And when she seem 'd to shake and fear your looks , She loved them most .
And so she did .
I am bound to thee forever .
I see this hath a little dash 'd your spirits .
Not a jot , not a jot .
I ' faith , I fear it has .
I hope you will consider what is spoke Comes from my love .
But I do see you 're moved ; I am to pray you not to strain my speech To grosser issues , nor to larger reach Than to suspicion .
I will not .
Should you do so , my lord , My speech should fall into such vile success Which my thoughts aim not at .
No , not much moved .
I do not think but Desdemona 's honest .
Long live she so !
and long live you to think so !
But pardon me .
I do not in position Distinctly speak of her ; though I may fear , Her will , recoiling to her better judgement , May fall to match you with her country forms , And happily repent .
Leave me , Iago .
My lord , I take my leave .
Why did I marry ?
This honest creature doubtless Sees and knows more , much more , than he unfolds .
In the meantime , Let me be thought too busy in my fears — As worthy cause I have to fear I am — And hold her free , I do beseech your honor .
Fear not my government .
I once more take my leave .
This fellow 's of exceeding honesty , And knows all qualities , with a learned spirit , Of human dealings .
If I do prove her haggard , Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings , I 'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind To prey at fortune .
O curse of marriage , That we can call these delicate creatures ours , And not their appetites !
I had rather be a toad , And live upon the vapor of a dungeon , Than keep a corner in the thing I love For others ' uses .
Yet , ' tis the plague of great ones ; Prerogatived are they less than the base ; ' Tis destiny unshunnable , like death : Even then this forked plague is fated to us When we do quicken .
I 'll not believe 't .
How now , my dear Othello !
Your dinner , and the generous islanders By you invited , do attend your presence .
I am to blame .
Why do you speak so faintly ?
Are you not well ?
I have a pain upon my forehead here .
Come , I 'll go in with you .
I am very sorry that you are not well .
I 'll have the work ta 'en out , And give 't Iago .
What he will do with it Heaven knows , not I ; I nothing but to please his fantasy .
Do not you chide ; I have a thing for you .
A thing for me ?
It is a common thing — Ha !
To have a foolish wife .
O , is that all ?
What will you give me now For that same handkerchief ?
What handkerchief ?
What handkerchief ?
Why , that the Moor first gave to Desdemona ; That which so often you did bid me steal .
Hast stol 'n it from her ?
Look , here it is .
A good wench ; give it me .
What will you do with 't , that you have been so earnest To have me filch it ?
Why , what is that to you ?
If 't be not for some purpose of import , Give 't me again .
Poor lady , she 'll run mad When she shall lack it .
Be not acknown on 't ; I have use for it .
Go , leave me .
I will in Cassio 's lodging lose this napkin , And let him find it .
Not poppy , nor mandragora , Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world , Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep Which thou owedst yesterday .
Why , how now , general !
No more of that .
Avaunt !
be gone !
How now , my lord ?
What sense had I of her stol 'n hours of lust ?
I am sorry to hear this .
I had been happy if the general camp , Pioners and all , had tasted her sweet body , So I had nothing known .
O , now forever Farewell the tranquil mind !
Farewell content !
Farewell the plumed troop and the big wars That make ambition virtue !
O , farewell , Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump , The spiritstirring drum , the earpiercing fife , The royal banner , and all quality , Pride , pomp , and circumstance of glorious war !
And O you mortal engines , whose rude throats The immortal Jove 's dread clamors counterfeit , Farewell !
Othello 's occupation 's gone !
Is 't possible , my lord ?
Villain , be sure thou prove my love a whore ; Be sure of it .
Give me the ocular proof ; Or , by the worth of man 's eternal soul , Thou hadst been better have been born a dog Than answer my waked wrath !
Is 't come to this ?
Make me to see 't ; or at the least so prove it , That the probation bear no hinge nor loop To hang a doubt on ; or woe upon thy life !
O grace !
O heaven defend me !
Are you a man ?
have you a soul or sense ?
God be wi ' you ; take mine office .
O wretched fool , That livest to make thine honesty a vice !
O monstrous world !
Take note , take note , O world , To be direct and honest is not safe .
I thank you for this profit , and from hence I 'll love no friend sith love breeds such offense .
I should be wise ; for honesty 's a fool , And loses that it works for .
By the world , I think my wife be honest , and think she is not ; I think that thou art just , and think thou art not .
I 'll have some proof .
Her name , that was as fresh As Dian 's visage , is now begrimed and black As mine own face .
If there be cords or knives , Poison or fire , or suffocating streams , I 'll not endure it .
Would I were satisfied !
You would be satisfied ?
Would ?
Nay , I will .
And may .
But , how ?
how satisfied , my lord ?
Death and damnation !
O !
It were a tedious difficulty , I think , To bring them to that prospect .
Damn them then , If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster More than their own !
What then ?
how then ?
What shall I say ?
Where 's satisfaction ?
It is impossible you should see this Were they as prime as goats , as hot as monkeys , As salt as wolves in pride , and fools as gross As ignorance made drunk .
But yet , I say , If imputation and strong circumstances , Which lead directly to the door of truth , Will give you satisfaction , you may have 't .
Give me a living reason she 's disloyal .
I do not like the office ; But sith I am enter 'd in this cause so far , Prick 'd to 't by foolish honesty and love , I will go on .
I lay with Cassio lately And , being troubled with a raging tooth , I could not sleep .
Nay , this was but his dream .
And this may help to thicken other proofs That do demonstrate thinly .
I 'll tear her all to pieces .
Tell me but this ; Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief Spotted with strawberries in your wife 's hand ?
I gave her such a one ; ' twas my first gift .
Now do I see ' tis true .
Arise , black vengeance , from thy hollow cell !
Yield up , O love , thy crown and hearted throne To tyrannous hate !
Swell , bosom , with thy fraught , For ' tis of aspics ' tongues !
Yet be content .
O , blood , blood , blood !
Patience , I say ; your mind perhaps may change .
Let him command , And to obey shall be in me remorse , What bloody business ever .
Damn her , lewd minx !
O , damn her !
Come , go with me apart ; I will withdraw , To furnish me with some swift means of death For the fair devil .
Now art thou my lieutenant .
I am your own forever .
Do you know , sirrah , where Lieutenant Cassio lies ?
I dare not say he lies anywhere .
Why , man ?
He 's a soldier ; and for one to say a soldier lies , is stab- bing .
To tell you where he lodges , is to tell you where I lie .
Can anything be made of this ?
I know not where he lodges , and for me to devise a lodging , and say he lies here or he lies there , were to lie in mine own throat .
Can you inquire him out and be edified by report ?
I will catechize the world for him ; that is , make ques- tions and by them answer .
Seek him , bid him come hither .
Tell him I have moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will be well .
To do this is within the compass of man 's wit , and therefore I will attempt the doing it .
Where should I lose that handkerchief , Emilia ?
I know not , madam .
Believe me , I had rather have lost my purse Full of crusadoes ; and , but my noble Moor Is true of mind and made of no such baseness As jealous creatures are , it were enough To put him to ill thinking .
Is he not jealous ?
Who , he ?
I think the sun where he was born Drew all such humors from him .
Look , where he comes .
I will not leave him now till Cassio Be call 'd to him .
How is 't with you , my lord ?
Well , my good lady .
O , hardness to dissemble !
How do you , Desdemona ?
Well , my good lord .
Give me your hand .
This hand is moist , my lady .
This hand of yours requires A sequester from liberty , fasting and prayer , Much castigation , exercise devout , For here 's a young and sweating devil here That commonly rebels .
Tis a good hand , A frank one .
You may , indeed , say so ; For ' twas that hand that gave away my heart .
A liberal hand .
The hearts of old gave hands ; But our new heraldry is hands , not hearts .
I cannot speak of this .
Come now , your promise .
What promise , chuck ?
I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you .
I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me ; Lend me thy handkerchief .
Here , my lord .
That which I gave you .
I have it not about me .
Not ?
No , faith , my lord .
That 's a fault .
That handkerchief Did an Egyptian to my mother give ; She was a charmer , and could almost read The thoughts of people .
She dying gave it me , And bid me , when my fate would have me wive , To give it her .
Is 't possible ?
Indeed !
is 't true ?
Most veritable ; therefore look to 't well .
Then would to God that I had never seen 't !
Ha !
wherefore ?
Why do you speak so startingly and rash ?
Is 't lost ?
is 't gone ?
speak , is it out o ' the way ?
Heaven bless us !
Say you ?
It is not lost ; but what an if it were ?
How ?
I say , it is not lost .
Fetch 't , let me see it .
Why , so I can , sir , but I will not now .
This is a trick to put me from my suit .
Pray you , let Cassio be received again .
Come , come ; You 'll never meet a more sufficient man .
The handkerchief !
A man that all his time Hath founded his good fortunes on your love , Shared dangers with you — The handkerchief !
In sooth , you are to blame .
Away !
Is not this man jealous ?
I ne 'er saw this before .
Sure there 's some wonder in this handkerchief ; I am most unhappy in the loss of it .
Go and importune her .
How now , good Cassio !
What 's the news with you ?
I would not be delay 'd .
Alas , thrice gentle Cassio !
My advocation is not now in tune ; My lord is not my lord , nor should I know him Were he in favor as in humor alter 'd .
So help me every spirit sanctified , As I have spoken for you all my best And stood within the blank of his displeasure For my free speech !
You must awhile be patient .
What I can do I will ; and more I will Than for myself I dare .
Let that suffice you .
Is my lord angry ?
He went hence but now , And certainly in strange unquietness .
Can he be angry ?
Something of moment then .
I prithee , do so .
Something sure of state , Either from Venice or some unhatch 'd practice Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him , Hath puddled his clear spirit ; and in such cases Men 's natures wrangle with inferior things , Though great ones are their object .
Tis even so ; For let our finger ache , and it indues Our other healthful members even to that sense Of pain .
Nay , we must think men are not gods , I was , unhandsome warrior as I am , Arraigning his unkindness with my soul ; But now I find I had suborn 'd the witness , And he 's indicted falsely .
Pray heaven it be state matters , as you think , And no conception nor no jealous toy Concerning you .
Alas the day , I never gave him cause !
But jealous souls will not be answer 'd so ; They are not ever jealous for the cause , But jealous for they are jealous .
Tis a monster Begot upon itself , born on itself .
Heaven keep that monster from Othello 's mind !
Lady , amen .
I will go seek him .
Cassio , walk hereabout .
If I do find him fit , I 'll move your suit , And seek to effect it to my uttermost .
I humbly thank your ladyship .
Save you , friend Cassio !
What make you from home ?
How is it with you , my most fair Bianca ?
I 'faith , sweet love , I was coming to your house .
seven days and nights ?
Eight score eight hours ?
and lovers ' absent hours , More tedious than the dial eight score times ?
O weary reckoning !
O Cassio , whence came this ?
This is some token from a newer friend .
Well , well .
Go to , woman !
Throw your vile guesses in the devil 's teeth , From whence you have them .
You are jealous now That this is from some mistress , some remembrance : No , by my faith , Bianca .
Why , whose is it ?
I know not , sweet .
I found it in my chamber .
I like the work well .
Leave you !
wherefore ?
I do attend here on the general ; And think it no addition , nor my wish , To have him see me woman 'd .
Why , I pray you ?
Not that I love you not .
But that you do not love me .
I pray you , bring me on the way a little ; And say if I shall see you soon at night .
Tis very good ; I must be circumstanced .
Will you think so ?
Think so , Iago ?
What , To kiss in private ?
An unauthorized kiss .
Or to be naked with her friend in bed An hour or more , not meaning any harm ?
Naked in bed , Iago , and not mean harm !
Why , then , ' tis hers , my lord , and being hers , She may , I think , bestow 't on any man .
Ay , what of that ?
That 's not so good now .
What if I had said I had seen him do you wrong ?
He hath , my lord ; but be you well assured , No more than he 'll unswear .
What hath he said ?
Faith , that he did — I know not what he did .
What ?
what ?
With her , on her , what you will .
Zounds , that 's fulsome !
Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some instruction .
It is not words that shakes me thus .
Pish !
Noses , ears , and lips .
Is 't possible ?
Confess ? — Handkerchief ? — O devil !
Work on , My medicine , work !
Thus credulous fools are caught : And many worthy and chaste dames even thus , All guiltless , meet reproach .
What , ho !
My lord !
My lord , I say !
Othello !
How now , Cassio !
What 's the matter ?
Rub him about the temples .
Look , he stirs : Do you withdraw yourself a little while , He will recover straight .
When he is gone , I would on great occasion speak with you .
How is it , general ?
Have you not hurt your head ?
Dost thou mock me ?
I mock you ?
No , by heaven .
Would you would bear your fortune like a man !
A horned man 's a monster and a beast .
There 's many a beast then in a populous city , And many a civil monster .
Did he confess it ?
Good sir , be a man ; Think every bearded fellow that 's but yoked May draw with you .
There 's millions now alive That nightly lie in those unproper beds Which they dare swear peculiar .
Your case is better .
O , ' tis the spite of hell , the fiend 's archmock , To lip a wanton in a secure couch , And to suppose her chaste !
No , let me know ; And knowing what I am , I know what she shall be .
O , thou art wise ; ' tis certain .
Stand you awhile apart ; Confine yourself but in a patient list .
Whilst you were here o 'erwhelmed with your grief — A passion most unsuiting such a man — Cassio came hither .
I shifted him away , And laid good ‘ scuse upon your ecstasy ; Bade him anon return and here speak with me ; The which he promised .
Marry , patience , Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen , And nothing of a man .
Dost thou hear , Iago ?
That 's not amiss ; But yet keep time in all .
Will you withdraw ?
Now will I question Cassio of Bianca , A housewife that by selling her desires Buys herself bread and clothes .
It is a creature That dotes on Cassio , as ' tis the strumpet 's plague To beguile many and be beguiled by one .
He , when he hears of her , cannot refrain From the excess of laughter .
Here he comes .
As he shall smile , Othello shall go mad ; And his unbookish jealousy must construe Poor Cassio 's smiles , gestures , and light behavior , Quite in the wrong .
How do you now , lieutenant ?
The worser that you give me the addition Whose want even kills me .
Ply Desdemona well , and you are sure on 't .
Now , if this suit lay in Bianca 's power , How quickly should you speed !
Alas , poor caitiff !
Look , how he laughs already !
I never knew a woman love man so .
Alas , poor rogue !
I think , i 'faith , she loves me .
Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out .
Do you hear , Cassio ?
Now he importunes him To tell it o 'er .
Go to ; well said , well said .
Ha , ha , ha !
Do you triumph , Roman ?
Do you triumph ?
I marry her !
What ?
A customer !
I prithee , bear some charity to my wit ; do not think it so unwholesome .
Ha , ha , ha !
So , so , so , so .
They laugh that win .
Faith , the cry goes that you shall marry her .
Prithee , say true .
I am a very villain else .
Have you scored me ?
Well .
This is the monkey 's own giving out .
She is persuaded I will marry her , out of her own love and flattery , not out of my promise .
Iago beckons me ; now he begins the story .
She was here even now ; she haunts me in every place .
So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me ; so hales and pulls me .
Ha , ha , ha !
Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber .
O , I see that nose of yours , but not that dog I shall throw it to .
Well , I must leave her company .
Before me !
look where she comes .
Tis such another fitchew !
marry , a perfumed one .
What do you mean by this haunting of me ?
Let the devil and his dam haunt you !
What did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now ?
I was a fine fool to take it .
I must take out the work ?
A likely piece of work that you should find it in your chamber and not know who left it there !
This is some minx 's token , and I must take out the work ?
There , give it your hobby-horse .
Wheresoever you had it , I 'll take out no work on 't .
How now , my sweet Bianca !
how now !
how now !
By heaven , that should be my handkerchief !
An you 'll come to supper tonight , you may ; an you will not , come when you are next prepared for .
After her , after her .
Faith , I must ; she 'll rail i ' the street else .
Will you sup there ?
Faith , I intend so .
Well , I may chance to see you , for I would very fain speak with you .
Prithee , come ; will you ?
Go to ; say no more .
How shall I murder him , Iago ?
Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice ?
O Iago !
And did you see the handkerchief ?
Was that mine ?
Yours , by this hand .
And to see how he prizes the fool- ish woman your wife !
She gave it him , and he hath given it his whore .
I would have him nine years akilling .
A fine woman !
a fair woman !
a sweet woman !
Nay , you must forget that .
Ay , let her rot , and perish , and be damned tonight , for she shall not live .
No , my heart is turned to stone ; I strike it , and it hurts my hand .
O , the world hath not a sweeter creature .
She might lie by an emperor 's side , and command him tasks .
Nay , that 's not your way .
Hang her !
I do but say what she is .
O , she will sing the savageness out of a bear .
Of so high and plenteous wit and invention !
She 's the worse for all this .
O , a thousand , a thousand times .
And then , of so gentle a condition !
Ay , too gentle .
Nay , that 's certain .
But yet the pity of it , Iago !
O Iago , the pity of it , Iago !
If you are so fond over her iniquity , give her patent to offend , for , if it touch not you , it comes near nobody .
I will chop her into messes .
Cuckold me !
O , ' tis foul in her .
With mine officer !
That 's fouler .
Get me some poison , Iago , this night .
I 'll not expostulate with her , lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again .
And for Cassio , let me be his undertaker .
You shall hear more by midnight .
Excellent good .
A trumpet without .
What trumpet is that same ?
Something from Venice , sure .
Tis Lodovico Come from the Duke .
And , see your wife is with him .
God save the worthy general !
With all my heart , sir .
The Duke and Senators of Venice greet you .
I kiss the instrument of their pleasures .
And what 's the news , good cousin Lodovico ?
I am very glad to see you , signior ; Welcome to Cyprus .
I thank you .
How does Lieutenant Cassio ?
Lives , sir .
Cousin , there 's fall 'n between him and my lord An unkind breech ; but you shall make all well .
Are you sure of that ?
My lord ?
Is there division ' twixt my lord and Cassio ?
A most unhappy one .
I would do much To atone them , for the love I bear to Cassio .
Fire and brimstone !
My lord ?
Are you wise ?
What , is he angry ?
May be the letter moved him ; For , as I think , they do command him home , Deputing Cassio in his government .
By my troth , I am glad on 't .
Indeed !
My lord ?
I am glad to see you mad .
I have not deserved this .
My lord , this would not be believed in Venice , Though I should swear I saw 't .
O devil , devil !
If that the earth could teem with woman 's tears , Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile .
Out of my sight !
I will not stay to offend you .
Mistress !
My lord ?
What would you with her , sir ?
Who , I , my lord ?
Proceed you in your tears .
Concerning this , sir — O well-painted passion ! — I am commanded home .
Get you away ; I 'll send for you anon .
Sir , I obey the mandate , And will return to Venice .
Hence , avaunt !
Cassio shall have my place .
And , sir , tonight , I do entreat that we may sup together .
You are welcome , sir , to Cyprus .
Goats and monkeys !
Is this the noble Moor whom our full Senate Call all in all sufficient ?
This the nature Whom passion could not shake ?
whose solid virtue The shot of accident nor dart of chance Could neither graze nor pierce ?
He is much changed .
Are his wits safe ?
Is he not light of brain ?
He 's that he is .
What , strike his wife !
Faith , that was not so well ; yet would I knew That stroke would prove the worst !
Is it his use ?
Or did the letters work upon his blood , And new create this fault ?
Alas , alas !
It is not honesty in me to speak What I have seen and known .
I am sorry that I am deceived in him .
You have seen nothing , then ?
Nor ever heard , nor ever did suspect .
Yes , you have seen Cassio and she together .
But then I saw no harm , and then I heard Each syllable that breath made up between them .
What , did they never whisper ?
Never , my lord .
Nor send you out o ' the way ?
Never .
To fetch her fan , her gloves , her mask , nor nothing ?
Never , my lord .
That 's strange .
I durst , my lord , to wager she is honest , Lay down my soul at stake .
If any wretch have put this in your head , Let heaven requite it with the serpent 's curse !
For if she be not honest , chaste , and true , There 's no man happy ; the purest of their wives Is foul as slander .
She says enough ; yet she 's a simple bawd That cannot say as much .
My lord , what is your will ?
Pray , chuck , come hither .
What is your pleasure ?
Let me see your eyes ; Look in my face .
What horrible fancy 's this ?
Upon my knees , what doth your speech import ?
I understand a fury in your words , But not the words .
Why , what art thou ?
Your wife , my lord , your true and loyal wife .
Come , swear it , damn thyself ; Lest , being like one of heaven , the devils themselves Should fear to seize thee .
Therefore be doubledamn 'd ; Swear thou art honest .
Heaven doth truly know it .
Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell .
To whom , my lord ?
with whom ?
how am I false ?
O Desdemona !
Away !
away !
away !
Alas the heavy day !
Why do you weep ?
Am I the motive of these tears , my lord ?
If haply you my father do suspect An instrument of this your calling back , Lay not your blame on me .
If you have lost him : Why , I have lost him too .
Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads To knot and gender in !
Turn thy complexion there , Patience , thou young and roselipp 'd cherubin , Ay , there , look grim as hell !
I hope my noble lord esteems me honest .
O , ay , as summer flies are in the shambles , That quicken even with blowing .
O thou weed , Who art so lovely fair and smell 'st so sweet That the sense aches at thee , would thou hadst ne 'er been born !
Alas , what ignorant sin have I committed ?
Was this fair paper , this most goodly book , Made to write “ whore ” upon ?
What committed ?
Committed !
O thou public commoner !
I should make very forges of my cheeks , That would to cinders burn up modesty , Did I but speak thy deeds .
What committed !
Heaven stops the nose at it , and the moon winks ; The bawdy wind , that kisses all it meets , Is hush 'd within the hollow mine of earth , And will not hear it .
What committed .
Impudent strumpet !
By heaven , you do me wrong .
Are not you a strumpet ?
No , as I am a Christian .
If to preserve this vessel for my lord From any other foul unlawful touch Be not to be a strumpet , I am none .
What , not a whore ?
No , as I shall be saved .
Is 't possible ?
O , heaven forgive us !
You , mistress , That have the office opposite to Saint Peter , And keep the gate of hell !
You , you , ay , you !
Alas , what does this gentleman conceive ?
How do you , madam ?
How do you , my good lady ?
Faith , half asleep .
Good madam , what 's the matter with my lord ?
With who ?
Why , with my lord , madam .
Who is thy lord ?
He that is yours , sweet lady .
I have none .
Do not talk to me , Emilia ; I cannot weep , nor answer have I none But what should go by water .
Prithee , tonight Lay on my bed my wedding sheets .
Remember ; And call thy husband hither .
Here 's a change indeed !
Tis meet I should be used so , very meet .
How have I been behaved , that he might stick The small 'st opinion on my least misuse ?
What is your pleasure , madam ?
How is 't with you ?
I cannot tell .
What 's the matter , lady ?
Alas , Iago , my lord hath so bewhored her , Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her , As true hearts cannot bear .
Am I that name , Iago ?
What name , fair lady ?
Such as she says my lord did say I was .
Why did he so ?
I do not know ; I am sure I am none such .
Do not weep , do not weep .
Alas the day !
Hath she forsook so many noble matches , Her father and her country and her friends , To be call 'd whore ?
Would it not make one weep ?
It is my wretched fortune .
How comes this trick upon him ?
Nay , heaven doth know .
I will be hang 'd , if some eternal villain , Some busy and insinuating rogue , Some cogging cozening slave , to get some office , Have not devised this slander ; I 'll be hang 'd else .
Fie , there is no such man ; it is impossible .
If any such there be , heaven pardon him !
A halter pardon him !
And hell gnaw his bones !
Why should he call her whore ?
Who keeps her company ?
What place ?
What time ?
What form ?
What likelihood ?
The Moor 's abused by some most villainous knave , Some base notorious knave , some scurvy fellow .
O heaven , that such companions thou 'ldst unfold , And put in every honest hand a whip To lash the rascals naked through the world Even from the east to the west !
Speak within door .
O , fie upon them !
Some such squire he was That turn 'd your wit the seamy side without , And made you to suspect me with the Moor .
You are a fool ; go to .
O good Iago , What shall I do to win my lord again ?
Good friend , go to him , for by this light of heaven , I know not how I lost him .
Unkindness may do much , And his unkindness may defeat my life , But never taint my love .
If ' twere no other — ' Tis but so , I warrant .
Hark , how these instruments summon to supper !
How now , Roderigo !
I do not find that thou dealest justly with me .
What in the contrary ?
Every day thou daffest me with some device , Iago ; and rather , as it seems to me now , keepest from me all conve- niency than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope .
Will you hear me , Roderigo ?
Faith , I have heard too much , for your words and per- formances are no kin together .
You charge me most unjustly .
With nought but truth .
I have wasted myself out of my means .
The jewels you have had from me to deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a votarist .
Well , go to , very well .
Very well !
go to !
I cannot go to , man ; nor ' tis not very well .
By this hand , I say ' tis very scurvy , and begin to find myself fopped in it .
Very well .
I tell you ' tis not very well .
You have said now .
Ay , and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing .
Why , now I see there 's mettle in thee ; and even from this instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before .
Give me thy hand , Roderigo .
Thou hast taken against me a most just exception ; but yet , I protest , have dealt most directly in thy affair .
It hath not appeared .
I grant indeed it hath not appeared , and your suspicion is not without wit and judgement .
Well , what is it ?
Is it within reason and compass ?
Sir , there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othello 's place .
Is that true ?
Why , then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice .
O , no ; he goes into Mauritania , and takes away with him the fair Desdemona , unless his abode be lingered here by some accident ; wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio .
How do you mean , removing of him ?
Why , by making him uncapable of Othello 's place ; knocking out his brains .
And that you would have me to do ?
Ay , if you dare do yourself a profit and a right .
He sups tonight with a harlotry , and thither will I go to him .
He knows not yet of his honorable fortune .
Come , stand not amazed at it , but go along with me ; I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him .
It is now high sup- pertime , and the night grows to waste .
About it .
I will hear further reason for this .
And you shall be satisfied .
I do beseech you , sir , trouble yourself no further .
O , pardon me ; ‘ twill do me good to walk .
Madam , good night ; I humbly thank your ladyship .
Your honor is most welcome .
Will you walk , sir ?
O — Desdemona — My lord ?
I will , my lord .
How goes it now ?
He looks gentler than he did .
Dismiss me ?
It was his bidding ; therefore , good Emilia , Give me my nightly wearing , and adieu .
We must not now displease him .
I would you had never seen him !
So would not I.
My love doth so approve him , That even his stubbornness , his checks , his frowns — Prithee , unpin me — have grace and favor in them .
I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed .
All 's one .
Good faith , how foolish are our minds !
If I do die before thee , prithee shroud me In one of those same sheets .
Come , come , you talk .
My mother had a maid call 'd Barbara ; She was in love , and he she loved proved mad And did forsake her .
She had a song of “ willow ” ; An old thing ' twas , but it express 'd her fortune , And she died singing it .
Prithee , dispatch .
Shall I go fetch your nightgown ?
No , unpin me here .
This Lodovico is a proper man .
A very handsome man .
He speaks well .
I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip .
The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree , Sing all a green willow ; Her hand on her bosom , her head on her knee , Sing willow , willow , willow .
It 's the wind .
I call 'd my love false love ; but what said he then ?
Mine eyes do itch ; Doth that bode weeping ?
Tis neither here nor there .
I have heard it said so .
O , these men , these men !
Dost thou in conscience think — tell me , Emilia — That there be women do abuse their husbands In such gross kind ?
There be some such , no question .
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world ?
Why , would not you ?
No , by this heavenly light !
Nor I neither by this heavenly light ; I might do 't as well i ' the dark .
Wouldst thou do such a thing for all the world ?
The world 's a huge thing ; it is a great price For a final vice .
In troth , I think thou wouldst not .
In troth , I think I should , and undo 't when I had done .
I should venture purgatory for 't .
Beshrew me , if I would do such a wrong For the whole world .
Why , the wrong is but a wrong i ' the world ; and hav- ing the world for your labor , ' tis a wrong in your own world , and you might quickly make it right .
I do not think there is any such woman .
Yes , a dozen , and as many to the vantage as would store the world they played for .
What is it that they do When they change us for others ?
Is it sport ?
I think it doth .
Is 't frailty that thus errs ?
It is so too .
And have not we affections , Desires for sport , and frailty , as men have ?
Good night , good night .
Heaven me such uses send , Not to pick bad from bad , but by bad mend !
Quick , quick ; fear nothing ; I 'll be at thy elbow .
It makes us , or it mars us ; think on that , And fix most firm thy resolution .
Be near at hand ; I may miscarry in 't .
Forth , my sword ; he dies .
I have rubb 'd this young quat almost to the sense , And he grows angry .
Now , whether he kill Cassio , Or Cassio him , or each do kill the other , Every way makes my gain .
Live Roderigo , He calls me to a restitution large Of gold and jewels that I bobb 'd from him , As gifts to Desdemona ; It must not be .
If Cassio do remain , He hath a daily beauty in his life That makes me ugly ; and besides , the Moor May unfold me to him ; there stand I in much peril : No , he must die .
I know his gait ; ' tis he .
Villain , thou diest !
O , I am slain !
I am maim 'd forever .
Help , ho !
Murder !
Murder !
O , villain that I am !
It is even so .
O , help , ho !
Light !
A surgeon !
Tis he .
O brave Iago , honest and just , That hast such noble sense of thy friend 's wrong !
Strumpet , I come !
Forth of my heart those charms , thine eyes , are blotted ; Thy bed , lust-stain 'd shall with lust 's blood be spotted .
What , ho !
No watch ?
No passage ?
Murder !
Murder !
Tis some mischance ; the cry is very direful .
O , help !
Hark !
O wretched villain !
Nobody come ?
Then shall I bleed to death .
Hark !
Here 's one comes in his shirt , with light and weapons .
Who 's there ?
Did not you hear a cry ?
Here , here !
for heaven 's sake , help me !
What 's the matter ?
This is Othello 's ancient , as I take it .
The same indeed ; a very valiant fellow .
What are you here that cry so grievously ?
Iago ?
O , I am spoil 'd , undone by villains !
Give me some help .
O me , lieutenant !
What villains have done this ?
I think that one of them is hereabout , And cannot make away .
O treacherous villains !
What are you there ?
Come in and give some help .
O , help me here !
That 's one of them .
O murderous slave !
O villain !
O damn 'd Iago !
O inhuman dog !
Kill men i ' the dark !
Where be these bloody thieves ?
How silent is this town !
Ho !
Murder !
Murder !
What may you be ?
Are you of good or evil ?
As you shall prove us , praise us .
Signior Lodovico ?
He , sir .
I cry you mercy .
Here 's Cassio hurt by villains .
Cassio ?
How is 't , brother ?
My leg is cut in two .
Marry , heaven forbid !
What is the matter , ho ?
Who is 't that cried ?
Who is 't that cried !
O my dear Cassio , my sweet Cassio !
O Cassio , Cassio , Cassio !
O notable strumpet !
Cassio , may you suspect Who they should be that have thus mangled you ?
No .
Lend me a garter .
So .
O , for a chair , To bear him easily hence !
Alas , he faints !
O Cassio , Cassio , Cassio !
Gentlemen all , I do suspect this trash To be a party in this injury .
Patience awhile , good Cassio .
Come , come ; Lend me a light .
Know we this face or no ?
Alas , my friend and my dear countryman Roderigo ?
No — yes , sure .
O heaven !
Roderigo .
What , of Venice ?
Even he , sir .
Did you know him ?
Know him !
ay .
Signior Gratiano ?
I cry you gentle pardon ; These bloody accidents must excuse my manners , That so neglected you .
O , a chair , a chair !
Roderigo !
He , he , ’ tis he .
Some good man bear him carefully from hence ; I 'll fetch the general 's surgeon .
For you , mistress , Save you your labor .
None in the world ; nor do I know the man .
What , look you pale ?
O , bear him out o ' the air .
Stay you , good gentlemen .
Look you pale , mistress ?
Do you perceive the gastness of her eye ?
Nay , if you stare , we shall hear more anon .
Behold her well ; I pray you , look upon her .
Do you see , gentlemen ?
Nay , guiltiness will speak , Though tongues were out of use .
Las , what 's the matter ?
What 's the matter , husband ?
Alas , good gentleman !
alas , good Cassio !
This is the fruit of whoring .
Prithee , Emilia , Go know of Cassio where he supp 'd tonight .
What , do you shake at that ?
He supp 'd at my house ; but I therefore shake not .
O , did he so ?
I charge you , go with me .
Fie , fie upon thee , strumpet !
I am no strumpet , but of life as honest As you that thus abuse me .
As I !
foh !
fie upon thee !
Kind gentlemen , let 's go see poor Cassio dress 'd .
Come , mistress , you must tell 's another tale .
Emilia , run you to the citadel , And tell my lord and lady what hath happ 'd !
Will you go on ?
Aside .
This is the night That either makes me or fordoes me quite .
It is the cause .
Yet I 'll not shed her blood , Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow And smooth as monumental alabaster .
Yet she must die , else she 'll betray more men .
Put out the light , and then put out the light .
O , balmy breath , that dost almost persuade Justice to break her sword !
One more , one more ; Be thus when thou art dead , and I will kill thee , And love thee after .
One more , and this the last : So sweet was ne 'er so fatal .
She wakes .
Who 's there ?
Othello ?
Ay , Desdemona .
Will you come to bed , my lord ?
Have you pray 'd tonight , Desdemona ?
Ay , my lord .
If you bethink yourself of any crime Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace , Solicit for it straight .
Alas , my lord , what may you mean by that ?
I would not kill thy soul .
Talk you of killing ?
Ay , I do .
Then heaven have mercy on me !
Amen , with all my heart !
If you say so , I hope you will not kill me .
Hum !
And yet I fear you , for you are fatal then When your eyes roll so .
Why I should fear I know not , Since guiltiness I know not ; but yet I feel I fear .
Think on thy sins .
They are loves I bear to you .
Ay , and for that thou diest .
That death 's unnatural that kills for loving .
Alas , why gnaw you so your nether lip ?
Peace , and be still !
I will so .
What 's the matter ?
That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee Thou gavest to Cassio .
No , by my life and soul !
Send for the man , and ask him .
Sweet soul , take heed , Take heed of perjury ; thou are on thy deathbed .
Ay , but not yet to die .
Thou art to die .
Then Lord have mercy on me !
I say , amen .
And have you mercy too !
I never did Offend you in my life ; never loved Cassio But with such general warranty of heaven As I might love .
I never gave him token .
By heaven , I saw my handkerchief in ‘ s hand .
O perjured woman !
He found it then ; I never gave it him .
He hath confess 'd .
What , my lord ?
That he hath used thee .
How ?
unlawfully ?
Ay .
He will not say so .
No , his mouth is stopp 'd ; Honest Iago hath ta 'en order for 't .
O , my fear interprets !
What , is he dead ?
Had all his hairs been lives , my great revenge Had stomach for them all .
Alas , he is betray 'd , and I undone !
Out , strumpet !
Weep 'st thou for him to my face ?
O , banish me , my lord , but kill me not !
Down , strumpet !
Kill me tomorrow ; let me live tonight !
Nay , if you strive — But half an hour !
Being done , there is no pause .
But while I say one prayer !
It is too late .
My lord , my lord !
What , ho !
my lord , my lord !
What noise is this ?
Not dead ?
not yet quite dead ?
I that am cruel am yet merciful ; I would not have thee linger in thy pain .
So , so .
What , ho !
my lord , my lord !
Who 's there ?
O , good my lord , I would speak a word with you !
By and by .
She 's dead .
Ha !
no more moving ?
Still as the grave .
Shall she come in ?
were 't good ?
I think she stirs again .
No .
What 's best to do ?
If she come in , she 'll sure speak to my wife .
My wife !
My wife !
What wife ?
I have no wife .
O , insupportable !
O heavy hour !
Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse Of sun and moon , and that the affrighted globe Should yawn at alteration .
I do beseech you That I may speak with you , O , good my lord !
I had forgot thee .
O , come in , Emilia .
Soft , by and by .
Let me the curtains draw .
Where art thou ?
What 's the matter with thee now ?
O , my good lord , yonder 's foul murders done !
What , now ?
But now , my lord .
It is the very error of the moon ; She comes more nearer earth than she was wont And makes men mad .
Cassio , my lord , hath kill 'd a young Venetian Call 'd Roderigo .
Roderigo kill 'd ?
And Cassio kill 'd ?
No , Cassio is not kill 'd .
Not Cassio kill 'd !
Then murder ' s out of tune , And sweet revenge grows harsh .
O , falsely , falsely murdered !
Alas , what cry is that ?
That ?
what ?
Out , and alas !
That was my lady 's voice .
Help !
help , ho !
help !
O lady , speak again !
Sweet Desdemona !
O sweet mistress , speak !
A guiltless death I die .
O , who hath done this deed ?
Nobody ; I myself .
O , farewell !
Why , how should she be murdered ?
Alas , who knows ?
You heard her say herself , it was not I.
O , the more angel she , And you the blacker devil !
She turn 'd to folly , and she was a whore .
Thou dost belie her , and thou art a devil .
She was false as water .
Thou art rash as fire , to say That she was false .
O , she was heavenly true !
Cassio did top her ; ask thy husband else .
O , I were damn 'd beneath all depth in hell , But that I did proceed upon just grounds To this extremity .
Thy husband knew it all .
My husband !
Thy husband .
That she was false to wedlock ?
Ay , with Cassio .
Nay , had she been true , If heaven would make me such another world Of one entire and perfect chrysolite , I 'ld not have sold her for it .
My husband !
My husband ?
What needs this iteration , woman ?
I say thy husband .
O mistress , villainy hath made mocks with love !
My husband say that she was false !
He , woman ; I say thy husband .
Dost understand the word ?
My friend , thy husband , honest , honest Iago .
If he say so , may his pernicious soul Rot half a grain a day !
He lies to the heart .
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain .
Ha !
Peace , you were best .
Thou hast not half that power to do me harm As I have to be hurt .
O gull !
O dolt !
As ignorant as dirt !
Thou hast done a deed — I care not for thy sword ; I 'll make thee known , Though I lost twenty lives .
Help !
help , ho !
help !
The Moor hath kill 'd my mistress !
Murder , murder !
What is the matter ?
How now , general ?
O , are you come , Iago ?
You have done well , That men must lay their murders on your neck .
What is the matter ?
Speak , for my heart is full .
I told him what I thought , and told no more Than what he found himself was apt and true .
But did you ever tell him she was false ?
I did .
You told a lie , an odious , damned lie ; Upon my soul , a lie , a wicked lie !
She false with Cassio ?
Did you say with Cassio ?
With Cassio , mistress .
Go to , charm your tongue .
I will not charm my tongue ; I am bound to speak .
My mistress here lies murdered in her bed .
O heavens forfend !
And your reports have set the murder on .
Tis a strange truth .
O monstrous act !
Villainy , villainy , villainy !
I think upon 't , I think , I smell 't , O villainy !
What , are you mad ?
I charge you , get you home .
Perchance , Iago , I will ne 'er go home .
O !
O !
O !
Nay , lay thee down and roar ; For thou hast kill 'd the sweetest innocent That e 'er did lift up eye .
O , she was foul !
I scarce did know you , uncle ; there lies your niece , Whose breath indeed these hands have newly stopp 'd .
I know this act shows horrible and grim .
Poor Desdemon !
I saw it in his hand : It was a handkerchief , an antique token My father gave my mother .
O heaven !
O heavenly powers !
Hold your peace .
Twill out , ' twill .
I peace !
Be wise , and get you home .
I will not .
Fie !
Your sword upon a woman ?
O thou dull Moor !
That handkerchief thou speak 'st of I found by fortune and did give my husband ; For often with a solemn earnestness , More than indeed belong 'd to such a trifle , He begg 'd of me to steal it .
Villainous whore !
She give it Cassio ?
No , alas , I found it , And I did give 't my husband .
Filth , thou liest !
By heaven , I do not , I do not , gentlemen .
O murderous coxcomb !
What should such a fool Do with so good a wife ?
Are there not stones in heaven But what serve for thunder ?
Precious villain !
The woman falls ; sure , he hath kill 'd his wife .
Ay , ay !
O , lay me by my mistress ’ side .
He 's gone , but his wife 's kill 'd .
Tis a notorious villain .
I 'll after that same villain , For ' tis a damned slave .
I am not valiant neither , But every puny whipster gets my sword .
But why should honor outlive honesty ?
Let it go all .
What did thy song bode , lady ?
Hark , canst thou hear me ?
I will play the swan , And die in music .
Sings .
Moor , she was chaste ; she loved thee , cruel Moor ; So come my soul to bliss , as I speak true ; So speaking as I think , I die , I die .
Uncle , I must come forth .
If thou attempt it , it will cost thee dear : Thou hast no weapon , and perforce must suffer .
Look in upon me then , and speak with me , Or , naked as I am , I will assault thee .
What is the matter ?
Behold , I have a weapon ; A better never did itself sustain Upon a soldier 's thigh .
I have seen the day That with this little arm and this good sword I have made my way through more impediments Than twenty times your stop .
But , O vain boast !
Who can control his fate ?
Tis not so now .
Be not afraid , though you do see me weapon 'd ; Here is my journey 's end , here is my butt And very seamark of my utmost sail .
Do you go back dismay 'd ?
Tis a lost fear : Man but a rush against Othello 's breast , And he retires .
Where should Othello go ?
Now , how dost thou look now ?
O ill-starr 'd wench !
Pale as thy smock !
When we shall meet at compt , This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven , And fiends will snatch at it .
O cursed , cursed slave !
Whip me , ye devils , From the possession of this heavenly sight !
Blow me about in winds !
Roast me in sulphur !
Wash me in steepdown gulfs of liquid fire !
O Desdemon !
dead , Desdemon !
dead !
Where is this rash and most unfortunate man ?
Where is that viper ?
Bring the villain forth .
I look down towards his feet ; but that 's a fable .
If that thou be 'st a devil , I cannot kill thee .
Wrench his sword from him .
I bleed , sir , but not kill 'd .
I am not sorry neither .
I 'ld have thee live , For , in my sense , ' tis happiness to die .
O thou Othello , that wert once so good , What shall be said to thee ?
Why , anything ; An honorable murderer , if you will , For nought did I in hate , but all in honor .
This wretch hath part confess 'd his villainy .
Did you and he consent in Cassio 's death ?
Ay .
Dear general , I never gave you cause .
I do believe it , and I ask your pardon .
Will you , I pray , demand that demidevil Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body ?
From this time forth I never will speak word .
What , not to pray ?
Torments will ope your lips .
Well , thou dost best .
Sir , you shall understand what hath befall 'n , Which , as I think , you know not .
Here is a letter Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo , And here another .
The one of them imports The death of Cassio to be undertook By Roderigo .
O villain !
Most heathenish and most gross !
Now here 's another discontented paper , Found in his pocket too ; and this , it seems , Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain ; But that , belike , Iago in the interim Came in and satisfied him .
O the pernicious caitiff !
How came you , Cassio , by that handkerchief That was my wife 's ?
I found it in my chamber ; And he himself confess 'd but even now That there he dropp 'd it for a special purpose Which wrought to his desire .
O fool !
fool !
fool !
For this slave , If there be any cunning cruelty That can torment him much and hold him long , It shall be his .
You shall close prisoner rest , Till that the nature of your fault be known To the Venetian state .
Come , bring away .
Soft you ; a word or two before you go .
I have done the state some service , and they know 't .
No more of that .
I pray you , in your letters , When you shall these unlucky deeds relate , Speak of me as I am ; nothing extenuate , Nor set down aught in malice .
Set you down this ; And say besides , that in Aleppo once , Where a malignant and a turban 'd Turk Beat a Venetian and traduced the state , I took by the throat the circumcised dog And smote him , thus .
O bloody period !
All that 's spoke is marr 'd .
I kiss 'd thee ere I kill 'd thee .
No way but this , Killing myself , to die upon a kiss .
This did I fear , but thought he had no weapon ; For he was great of heart .
O Spartan dog , More fell than anguish , hunger , or the sea !
Look on the tragic loading of this bed ; This is thy work .
The object poisons sight ; Let it be hid .
Gratiano , keep the house , And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor , For they succeed on you .
Myself will straight aboard , and to the state This heavy act with heavy heart relate .
Good , speak to the mariners .
Bestir Heigh , my hearts !
Cheerly , cheerly , my hearts !
Yare , yare !
Take in the topsail .
Tend to the Master 's whistle !
Blow , till thou burst thy wind , if room enough !
Where 's the Master ?
To the Mariners &ket; Play the men !
To the Mariners &ket; Play the I pray now , keep below .
Where is the Master , Boatswain ?
Do you not hear him ?
Nay , good , be patient .
When the sea is .
Hence !
What cares these roarers for the name of the king ?
Trouble us not .
Good , yet remember whom thou has aboard .
None that I more love than myself .
You are a counsellor ; if you can command these elements to silence , and work the peace of the present , we will not hand a rope more ; use your authority .
I have great comfort from this fellow .
Methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him ; his complexion is perfect gallows .
Stand fast , good Fate , to his hanging .
Make the rope of his destiny our cable , for our own doth little advantage .
If he be not born to be hanged , our case is miserable .
Down with the topmast !
Yare !
Lower , lower !
A cry within &ket; A plague &bra; A cry within &ket; A plague upon this howling !
What do you here ?
Shall we give o 'er and drown ?
Have you a mind to sink ?
A pox o ’ your throat , you bawling , blasphemous , incharitable dog !
Work you , then .
Hang , cur , hang , you whoreson , insolent noise- maker !
We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art .
I 'll warrant him for drowning , though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench .
All lost !
To prayers , to prayers !
All lost !
What , must our mouths be cold ?
The king and prince at prayers !
Let 's assist them , For our case is theirs .
I 'm out of patience .
He 'll be hanged yet , Though every drop of water swear against it , And gape at wid 'st to glut him .
Let 's take leave of him .
Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground — long heath , brown furze , anything .
If by your art , my dearest father , you have Put the wild waters in this roar , allay them .
The sky , it seems , would pour down stinking pitch , But that the sea , mounting to th ’ welkin 's cheek , Dashes the fire out .
Poor souls , the perished .
Had I been any god of power , I would Have sunk the sea within the earth , or ere It should the good ship so have swallowed and The fraughting souls within her .
No harm .
More to know Did never meddle with my thoughts .
Tis time I should inform thee farther .
Lend thy hand , And pluck my magic garment from me . — So : &bra; Lays down his cloak &ket; &bra; Lays down his cloak &ket; Lie there , my art . — Wipe thou thine eyes ; have comfort .
Sit down ; For thou must now know farther .
You have often Begun to tell me what I am , but stopped And left me to a bootless inquisition , Concluding ‘ Stay , not yet . ’ The hour 's now come ; The very minute bids thee ope thine ear , Obey , and be attentive .
Canst thou remember A time before we came unto this cell ?
I do not think thou canst , for then thou wast not Out three years old .
Certainly , sir , I can .
By what ?
Tis far off , And rather like a dream than an assurance That my remembrance warrants .
Had I not Four or five women once that tended me ?
Thou hadst , and more , Miranda .
But how is it That this lives in thy mind ?
What seest thou else In the dark backward and abyss of time ?
If thou rememb 'rest aught ere thou cam 'st here , How thou cam 'st here thou mayst .
But that I do not .
Thy mother was a piece of virtue , and She said thou wast my daughter ; and thy father Was Duke of Milan , and his only heir And princess no worse issued .
O , the heavens !
What foul play had we that we came from thence ?
Or blessèd was 't we did ?
Both , both , my girl .
By foul play , as thou sayst , were we heaved thence , But blessedly holp hither .
Please you , farther .
Thy false uncle — Dost thou attend me ?
Sir , most heedfully .
O good sir , I do .
I pray thee mark me .
Your tale , sir , would cure deafness .
To have no screen between this part he played And him he played it for ; he needs will be Absolute Milan .
O the heavens !
Mark his condition and th ’ event ; then tell me If this might be a brother .
I should sin To think but nobly of my grandmother : Good wombs have borne bad sons .
Now the condition .
Alack , for pity !
I , not rememb 'ring how I cried out then , Will cry it o 'er again : it is a hint That wrings mine eyes to 't .
Hear a little further , And then I 'll bring thee to the present business Which now 's upon 's ; without the which this story Were most impertinent .
Wherefore did they not That hour destroy us ?
Well demanded , wench ; My tale provokes that question .
There they hoist us , To cry to th ’ sea that roared to us , to sigh To th ’ winds , whose pity , sighing back again , Did us but loving wrong .
Alack , what trouble Was I then to you !
O , a cherubin Thou wast that did preserve me .
Thou didst smile , Infused with a fortitude from heaven , When I have decked the sea with drops full salt , Under my burden groaned ; which raised in me An undergoing stomach , to bear up Against what should ensue .
How came we ashore ?
By Providence divine .
Would I might But ever see that man !
Here in this island we arrived , and here Have I , thy schoolmaster , made thee more profit Than other princesess ’ can , that have more time For vainer hours and tutors not so careful .
Heavens thank you for 't .
And now I pray you , sir — For still ’ tis beating in my mind , — your reason For raising this sea-storm .
Know thus far north .
I am ready now .
Approach , my Ariel , come !
To every article .
My brave spirit !
Who was so firm , so constant , that this coil Would not infect his reason ?
Not a soul But felt a fever of the mad and played Some tricks of desperation .
But was not this nigh shore ?
Close by , my master .
But are they , Ariel , safe ?
Not a hair perished ; On their sustaining garments not a blemish , But fresher than before ; and as thou bad 'st me , In troops I have dispersed them ’ bout the isle .
The King 's son have I landed by himself , Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs In an odd angle of the isle , and sitting , His arms in this sad knot .
Of the King 's ship , The mariners , say how thou hast disposed , And all the rest o 'th ’ fleet .
Ariel , thy charge Exactly is performed ; but there 's more work .
What is the time o 'th ’ day ?
Past the mid season .
At least two glasses .
The time ’ twixt six and now Must by us both be spent most preciously .
Is there more toil ?
Since thou dost give me pains Let me remember thee what thou hast promised , Which is not yet performed me .
How now ?
Moody ?
What is 't thou canst demand ?
My liberty .
Before the time be out ?
No more !
I prithee , Remember I have done thee worthy service , Told thee no lies , made thee no mistakings , served Without or grudge or grumblings .
Thou did promise To bate me a full year .
Dost thou forget From what a torment I did free thee ?
No .
Thou dost , and think 'st it much to tread the ooze Of the salt deep , To run upon the sharp wind of the north , To do me business in the veins o 'th ’ earth When it is baked with frost .
I do not , sir .
Thou liest , malignant thing !
Hast thou forgot The foul witch Sycorax , who with age and envy Was grown into a hoop ?
Hast thou forgot her ?
No , sir .
Thou hast .
Where was she born ?
Speak ; tell me .
Sir , in Algiers .
I must Once in a month recount what thou hast been , Which thou forget 'st .
This damned witch Sycorax , For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible To enter human hearing , from Algiers Thou know 'st was banished — for one thing she did They would not take her life .
Is not this true ?
Ay , sir .
This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child , And here was left by th ’ sailors .
Then was this island — Save for the son that she did litter here , A freckled whelp , hag-born — not honoured with A human shape .
Yes , Caliban her son .
Dull thing , I say so : he , that Caliban Whom now I keep in service .
I thank thee , master .
If thou more murmur 'st , I will rend an oak , And peg thee in his knotty entrails till Thou hast howled away twelve winters .
Do so , and after two days I will discharge thee .
That 's my noble master !
What shall I do ?
Go take this shape , And hither come in 't : go ; hence with diligence !
Exit Ariel &ket; &bra; Exit Ariel &ket; Awake , dear heart , awake !
Thou hast slept well ; Awake .
The strangeness of your story put Heaviness in me .
Shake it off .
Come on ; We 'll visit Caliban my slave , who never Yields us kind answer .
Tis a villain , sir , I do not love to look on .
But as ’ tis , We cannot miss him : he does make our fire , Fetch in our wood , and serves in offices That profit us .
There 's wood enough within .
When ?
Fine apparition !
My lord , it shall be done .
Thou poisonous slave , got by the devil himself Upon thy wicked dam , come forth !
As wicked dew as e 'er my mother brushed With raven 's feather from unwholesome fen Drop on you both !
A south-west blow on ye And blister you all o 'er !
I must eat my dinner .
This island 's mine , by Sycorax my mother , Which thou tak 'st from me .
All the charms Of Sycorax , toads , beetles , bats , light on you !
For I am all the subjects that you have , Which first was mine own king , and here you sty me In this hard rock , whiles you do keep from me The rest o ‘ th ’ island .
Thou most lying slave , Whom stripes may move , not kindness !
I have used thee , Filth as thou art , with human care , and lodged thee In mine own cell , till thou didst seek to violate The honour of my child .
Would 't had been done !
Thou didst prevent me ; I had peopled else This isle with Calibans .
Abhorrèd slave , Which any print of goodness wilt not take , Being capable of all ill !
Hag-seed , hence !
Fetch us in fuel , and be quick , thou 'rt best , To answer other business . — Shrug 'st thou , malice ?
So , slave , hence !
sings &ket; &bra; sings &ket; Come unto these yellow sands , And than take hands ; Curtsied when you have and the kissed — The wild waves whist — Foot it featly here and there , And , sweet sprites , bear The burden .
Hark , hark !

Hark , hark !
I 'th ’ air or th ’ earth ?
It sounds no more ; and sure it waits upon Some god o 'th ’ island .
No , it begins again .
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell : Ding dong .
The ditty does remember my drowned father .
This is no mortal business , nor no sound That the earth owes . — I hear it now above me .
What is 't ?
A spirit ?
Lord , how it looks about !
He hath lost his fellows , And strays about to find ’ em I might call him A thing divine , for nothing natural I ever saw so noble .
Aside &ket; It goes on , I see , &bra; Aside &ket; As my soul prompts it .

No wonder , sir , But certainly a maid .
My language !
How ?
The best ?
What wert thou if the King of Naples heard thee ?
A single thing , as I am now , that wonders To hear thee speak of Naples .
He does hear me , And that he does I weep ; myself am Naples , Who with mine eyes , never since at ebb , beheld The King my father wrecked .
Alack , for mercy !
Yes , faith , and all his lords , the Duke of Milan And his brave son being twain .
Aside &ket; Why speaks my father so urgently ?
This &bra; Aside &ket; Why speaks my father so urgently ?
Soft , sir !
One word more .
to Ferdinand &ket; One word more ; I &bra; to Ferdinand &ket; One word more ; I charge thee That thou attend me .
Thou dost here usurp The name thou ow 'st not ; and hast put thyself Upon this island as a spy , to win it From me , the lord on 't .
No , as I am a man .
Follow .
No ; I will resist such entertainment till Mine enemy has more power .
What , I say , My foot my tutor ?
Hang not on my garments .
Sir , have pity ; I 'll be his surety .
Silence !
One word more Shall make me chide thee , if not hate thee .
Hush !
To th ’ most of men this is a Caliban , And they to him are angels .

Twas a sweet marriage , and we prosper well in our return .
Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their queen .
Not since widow Dido 's time .
Widow ?
A pox o 'that !
How came that widow in ?
Widow Dido !
to Gonzalo &ket; ‘ Widow Dido ’ said you ?
You make me study of that : she was of Carthage , not of Tunis .
This Tunis , sir , was Carthage .
Carthage ?
I assure you , Carthage .

I think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple .

I mean , in a sort .
You cram these words into mine ears against The stomach of my sense .
Would I have never Married my daughter there !
For , coming thence , My son is lost , and , in my rate , she too , Who is so far from Italy removed I ne 'er again shall see her .
No , no ; he 's gone .
Prithee , peace .
You were kneeled to an importuned otherwise By all of us , and the fair soul herself Weighed between loathness and obedience at Which end o 'th ’ beam should bow .
So is the dear 'st o 'th ’ loss .
My lord Sebastian , The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness And time to speak it in — you rub the sore , When you should bring the plaster .
Very well .
And most chirurgeonly .

Long live Gonzalo !
I do well believe your highness , and did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen , who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing .
Twas you we laughed at .
Who , in this kind of merry fooling , am nothing to you ; so you may continue and laugh at nothing still .
What a blow was there given !
An it had not fallen flat-long .
You are gentlemen of brave mettle ; you would lift the moon out of her sphere , if she would continue in it five weeks without changing .
We would so , and then go a-bat-fowling .. &bra; to Gonzalo &ket; Nay , good my lord , be not angry .
to Gonzalo &ket; Nay , good my lord , be not angry .
No , I warrant you ; I will not adventure my discre- tion so weakly .
Will you laugh me asleep , for I am very heavy ?
Go sleep , and hear us .
I wish mine eyes Would , with themselves , shut up my thoughts : I find They are inclined to do so .
We two , my lord , Will guard your person while you take your rest , And watch your safety .
Thank you .
Wondrous heavy .
What a strange drowsiness possesses them !
It is the quality o 'th ’ climate .
Why Doth it not then our eyelids sink ?
I find not Myself disposed to sleep .
Nor I ; my spirits are nimble .
They fell together all , as by consent ; They dropped , as by a thunder-stroke .
Do you not hear me speak ?
I do ; and surely It is a sleepy language and thou speak 'st Out of thy sleep .
What is it thou didst say ?
This is a strange repose , to be asleep With eyes wide open ; standing , speaking , moving , And yet so fast asleep .
Noble Sebastian , Thou let 'st thy fortune sleep — die rather ; wink 'st Whiles thou art waking .
Thou dost snore distinctly ; There 's meaning in thy snores .
Well , I am standing water .
I 'll teach you how to flow .
Do so : to ebb Hereditary sloth instructs me .
O , If you but knew how you the purpose cherish Whiles thus you mock it ; how in stripping it .
You more invest it !
Ebbing men , indeed , Most often do so near the bottom run By their own fear or sloth .
I have no hope That he 's undrowned .
No hope that way is Another way so high a hope that even Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond , But doubt discovery there .
Will you grant with me That Ferdinand is drowned ?
He 's gone .
Then , tell me , Who 's the next heir of Naples ?
Claribel .
How say you ?
Tis true my brother 's daughter 's Queen of Tunis ; So is she heir of Naples ; ’ twixt which regions There is some space .
There be that can rule Naples As well as he that sleeps , lords that can prate As amply and unnecessarily As this Gonzalo ; I myself could make A chough of as deep chat .
O , that you bore The mind that I do !
what a sleep were this For your advancement !
Do you understand me ?
Methinks I do .
And how does your content Tender your own good fortune ?
For all the rest , They 'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk ; They 'll tell the clock to any business that We say befits the hour .
Thy case , dear friend , Shall be my precedent : as thou got 'st Milan , I 'll come by Naples .
Draw thy sword — one stroke Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest , And I the King shall love thee .
Draw together , And when I rear my hand , do you the like , To fall it on Gonzalo .

Ho , awake !
waking &ket; Why , how now ?
to Gonzalo &ket; Wherefore this What 's the matter ?
It struck mine ear most terribly .
I heard nothing .
Heard you this , Gonzalo ?
Upon mine honour , sir , I heard a humming , And that a strange one too , which did awake me .
Lead off this ground , and let 's make further search For my poor son .
Heavens keep him from these beasts !
For he is sure i 'th ’ island .
Lead away .
All the infections that the sun sucks up From bogs , fens , flats , on Prosper fall , and make him By inch-meal disease !
A noise of thunder heard &ket; &bra; A noise of thunder heard &ket; His spirits hear me , And yet I needs must curse .
Here comes a spirit of his , and to torment me For bringing wood in slowly , I 'll fall flat .
Perchance he will not mind me .
A fish : he smells like a fish ; a very ancient and fish-like smell ; a kind of not- of-the-newest Poor-John .
A strange fish !
When they will not give a dolt to relieve a lame beggar , they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian .
Legged like a man , and his fins like arms !
Warm o 'my troth !
I do now let loose my opinion ; hold it no longer : this is no fish , but an islander that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt .
Thunder &ket; &bra; Thunder &ket; Alas , the storm is come again !
I will here , shroud till the dregs of the storm be past .
This is a scurvy tune too : but here 's my comfort .
What 's the matter ?
Have we devils here ?
This is some monster of the isle with four legs , who hath got , as I tak it , an ague .
Where the devil should he learn our language ?
He 's in his fit now , and does not talk after the wisest .
Four legs and two voices — a most delicate monster !
His forward voice now is to speak well of his friend ; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract .
If all the wine in my bottle will recover him , I will help his ague .
Come .
Caliban drinks &ket; Amen !
I will pour some in &bra; Caliban drinks &ket; thy other mouth .
Stephano !
Doth thy other mouth call me ?
If thou beest Trinculo , come forth .
He pulls Trinculo out from under Caliban 's cloak by the legs &ket; Thou art very Trinculo indeed !
How cam 'st thou to be the siege of this moon-calf ?
can he vent Trinculos ?
I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke .
But art thou not drowned , Stephano ?
I hope now thou art not drowned .
Is the storm overblown ?
I hid me under the dead moon-calf 's gaberdine for fear of the storm .
And art thou living , Stephano ?
O Stephano , two Neapolitans scaped !
Prithee , do not turn me about ; my stomach is not constant .
to Trinculo &ket; How didst thou ’ scape ?
How cam 'st thou hither ?
Swear by this bottle how thou cam 'st hither .
I escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors heaved o 'erboard — by this bottle , which I made of the bark of a tree with mine own hands since I was cast ashore .
I 'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject , for the liquor is not earthly .
Here , kiss the book .
Though thou canst swim like a duck , thou art made like a goose .
Hast thou not dropped from heaven ?
Out o 'th ’ moon , I do assure thee : I was the man i 'th ’ moon when time was .
The man i 'th ’ moon ?
I 'll show thee every fertile inch o 'th ’ island ; And I will kiss thy foot .
I prithee , be my god .
Come on then ; down , and swear .
I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed monster .
A most scurvy monster !
I could find in my heart to beat him — Come , kiss .
I 'll show thee the best springs ; I 'll pluck thee berries ; I 'll fish for thee , and get thee wood enough .
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve !
I 'll bear him no more sticks , but follow thee , Thou wondrous man .
A most ridiculous monster , to make a wonder of a poor drunkard !
Wilt thou go with me ?

Freedom , high-day , freedom !
O brave monster !
Lead the way .
This my mean task Would be as heavy to me as odious , but The mistress which I serve quickens what 's dead And makes my labours pleasures .
O , she is Ten times more gentle than her father 's crabbed , And he 's composed of harshness .
I forget , But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours , Most busil 'est , when I do it .
O most dear mistress , The sun will set before I shall discharge What I must strive to do .
If you 'll sit down I 'll bear your logs the while .
Pray , give me that ; I 'll carry it to the pile .
It would become me As well as it does you ; and I should do it With much more ease , for my good will is to it , And yours it is against .
aside &ket; Poor worm , thou art infected !
You look wearily .
No , noble mistress , ’ tis fresh morning with me When you are by at night .
I do beseech you — Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers — What is your name ?
Miranda .
O my father , I have broke your hest to say so !
Admired Miranda !
Indeed the top of admiration , worth What 's dearest to the world !
But you , O you , So perfect and so peerless , are created Of every creature 's best !
But I prattle Something too wildly , and my father 's precepts I therein do forget .
Do you love me ?

But this is trifling , And all the more it seeks to hide itself The bigger bulk it shows .
Hence , bashful cunning !
And prompt me , plain and holy innocence !
I am your wife , if you will marry me .
If not , I 'll die your maid : to be your fellow You may deny me , but I 'll be your servant Whether you will or no .

The folly of this island !
They say there 's but five upon this isle : we are three of them ; if th 'other two be brained like us , the state totters .
Where should they be set else ?
He were a brave mon- ster indeed , if they were set in his tail My man-monster hath drowned his tongue in sack .
By this light , thou shalt be my lieutenant , monster , or my standard .
Your lieutenant , if you list , he 's no standard .
We 'll not run , Monsieur Monster .
Nor go neither ; but you 'll lie like dogs and yet say nothing neither .
Moon-calf , speak once in thy life , if thou beest a good moon-calf .
How does thy honour ?
Let me lick thy shoe .
I 'll not serve him ; he 's not valiant .
Why , thou debauched fish , thou , was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as I to-day ?
Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie , being but half a fish and half a monster ?

Wilt thou let him , my lord ?
Bite him to death , I &bra; to Stephano &ket; Lo , lo , again !
Bite him to death , I prithee .
The poor monster 's my subject , and he shall not suffer indignity .
I thank my noble lord .
Wilt thou be pleased to hearken once again to the suit I made to thee ?
As I told thee before , I am subject to a tyrant , a sorcerer , that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island .
Thou liest .
Trinculo , if you trouble him any more in 's tale , by this hand , I will supplant some of your teeth .
Why , I said nothing .
Thou shalt be lord of it , and I 'll server thee .
How now shall this be compassed ?
Canst thou bring me to the party ?
Thou liest ; thou canst not .
What a pied ninny 's this !
Trinculo , run into no further danger : interrupt the monster one word further , and , by this hand , I 'll turn my mercy out o 'doors and make a stockfish of thee .
Why , what did I ?
I did nothing .
I 'll go farther off .
Didst thou not say he lied ?
Thou liest .
Do I so ?
Take thou that .
Beating Trinculo &ket; As you like &bra; Beating Trinculo &ket; As you like this , give me the lie another time .

Remember First to possess his books , for without them He 's but a sot , as I am , nor hath not One spirit to command — they all do hate him As rootedly as I.
Is it so brave as lass ?
Dost thou like the plot , Trinculo ?
Excellent .
Ay , on mine honour .
Thou mak 'st me merry ; I am full of pleasure .
At thy request , monster , I will do reason , any reason .
Come on , Trinculo , let us sing .
Flout ’ em and scout ’ em , And scout ’ em and flout ’ em Thought is free .
That 's not the tune .
What is this same ?
This is the tune of our catch , played by the picture of Nobody .
O , forgive me my sins !
Art thou afeared ?
No , monster , not I.
This will prove a brave kingdom to me , where I shall have my music for nothing .
When Prospero is destroyed .
He lays it on .
Wilt come ?
I 'll follow , Stephano .
By your patience , I needs must rest me .

Sit down and rest .

Or that there were such men Whose heads stood in their breasts ?
Which now we find Each putter-out of five for one will bring us Good warrant of .
I have made you mad , And even with suchlike valour men hang and drown Their proper selves .

If you could hurt , Your swords are now too massy for your strengths And will not be uplifted .

Therefore my son i 'th ’ ooze is bedded , and I 'll seek him deeper than e 'er plummet sounded , And with him there lie mudded .

Do not approach Till thou dost hear me call .
Well , I conceive .

Well . — Now come , my Ariel !
Bring a corollary , Rather than want a spirit .
Appear and pertly !
No tongue , all eyes !
Be silent .
Approach , rich Ceres , her to entertain .
A contract of true love to celebrate ; And some donation freely to estate On the blest lovers .
Tell me , heavenly bow , If Venus or her son , as thou dost know , Do now attend the queen .
Since they did plot The means that dusky Dis my daughter got , Her and her blind boy 's scandaled company I have forsworn .
Of her society Be not afraid .
Here thought they to have done Some wanton charm upon this man and miad , Whose vows are that no bed-right shall be paid Till Hymen 's torch be lighted — but in vain .
High 'st queen of state , Great Juno , comes ; I know her by her gait .
How does my bounteous sister ?
Go with me To bless this twain , that they may Prospus be And honoured in their issue .
Honour , riches , marriage-blessing , Long continuance , and increasing , Hourly joys be still upon you !
Juno sings her blessings upon you .
Earth 's increase , foison plenty , Barns and garners never empty , Vines and clust 'ring bunches growing , Plants and goodly burden bowing ; Spring come to you at the farthest In the very end of harvest !
Scarcity and want shall shun you , Ceres ’ blessing so is on you .
Spirits , which by mine art I have from their confines call 'd to enact My present fancies .
Sweet now , silence !
Your nymphs , called naiads of the wandering brooks , With your sedged crowns and over-harmless looks , Leave your crisp channels and on this green land Answer your summons ; Juno does command .
You sunburnt sicklemen , of August weary , Come hither from the furrow and be merry ; Make holiday , your rye-straw hats put on , And these fresh nymphs encounter every one In country footing .

Spirit , We must prepare to meet with Caliban .
Say again : where didst thou leave these variets ?
I told you , sir , they were red-hot with drinking ; So fun of valour that they smote the air For breathing in their faces , beat the ground For kissing of their feet ; yet always bending Towards their project .
This was well done , my bird .
A devil , a born devil , on whose nature Nurture can never stick ; on whom my pains , Humanely taken , all , all lost , quite lost , And , as with age his body uglier grows , So his mind cankers .

Come , hang them on this line .
Monster , you fairy , which you say is a harmless fairy , has done little better than played the Jack with us .

As great to me as late ; and supportable To make the dear loss have I means much weaker Than you may call to comfort you , for I Have lost my daughter .
A daughter ?
When did you lose your daughter ?
In this last tempest .
I perceive these lords At this encounter do so much admire That they devour their reason and scarce think Their eyes do offices of truth , these words Are natural breath .
No more yet of this , For ‘ tis a chronicle of day by day , Not a relation for a breakfast , nor Befitting this first meeting .
Here have I few attendants And subjects none abroad .
Pray you , look in .

Sweet lord , you play me false .
No , my dear 'st love , I would not for the world .
Yes , for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle , And I would call it fair play .

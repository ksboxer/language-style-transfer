the spectacle of a matron of classical deportment , seizing an ancient woman by the throat , and hauling her into a dwelling-house , would have been under any circumstances , sufficient temptation to all true english stragglers so blest as to witness it , to force a way into that dwelling-house and see the matter out .
i am going out , she said without looking at it .
yes , sir , returned young john .
why , wait patiently , my dear , until he thinks better of it , replied mr .
she is in italy , with all her family , flora , he said , when the dreaded lady was occupied again .
micawber , with the same genteel air , and in another burst of confidence--i live there .
i want to know , said arthur clennam , --and again stated his case in the same barrel-organ way .
the father had positively refused to see his son from the moment of his apprehension ; and it was a matter of indifference to him whether he lived or died .
my dear , replied the jew , you must get up very early in the morning , to win against the dodger .
i dare say my friend dombey ; for the general attention was concentrated on cousin feenix ; may remember jack adams , jack adams , not joe ; that was his brother .
i have not intended to do much harm , but i seem to have been capable of nothing else .
the latter gentleman at once burst into the exclamation : a beadle .
there they are , said herbert , coming out of the tap .
bob sawyer , with desperate sternness .
find it a little dull , miss dorrit ?
a people there are , no doubt--a certain large number of supernumeraries , who are to be occasionally addressed , and relied upon for shouts and choruses , as on the theatrical stage ; but boodle and buffy , their followers and families , their heirs , executors , administrators , and assigns , are the born first-actors , managers , and leaders , and no others can appear upon the scene for ever and ever .
and thats not all .
he thought , then , that her cheek was more strained than usual , and that it was colder .
mr dorrit was enraptured by these attentions .
she was not born here as i was , you know , father .
you made mention of the young lady as a golden-haired doll .
in another minute , mr panckss arms were on the desk , and mr panckss head was bowed down upon them ; and for some time they remained in these attitudes , idle and silent , with the width of the little room between them .
' will you speak ?
he had looked at him on opening the door , and he now looked at him again (stealthily this time) , and the result of his looking was , that he asked him no question .
they are much inclined to moralise .

yes , i think it seems full three years , quilp , was the unfortunate reply .
there were a white bank , and a red brewery , and a yellow town-hall ; and in one corner there was a large house , with all the wood about it painted green : before which was the sign of the george .
and the world shall deal by you as it does by me , till one or both of us shall quit it for a better .

let us walk .
' inquired fagin .
we , sir , we , are guided entirely by the statement of our client .
his face was flushed and eager , his eyes were strained , his teeth set , his breath came short and thick , and the hand he laid upon her arm trembled so violently that she shook beneath its grasp .
sikes , meanwhile , flinging himself on the bed , and composing himself to sleep away the time until the young ladys return .
it doubles our income , doctor strong , said i .
' one of us .
oliver having ' caught it , ' in fulfilment of noah ' s prediction , followed that young gentleman down the stairs to breakfast .
weeks off ?
next to nothing .
she was quite mad , and had to be held by force ; or , if she couldnt have got to a knife , or got to the sea , shed have beaten her head against the marble floor .
or he wont , and thats the same thing .
' growled this engaging ruffian .
as this change stole on annie , once like sunshine in the doctors house , the doctor became older in appearance , and more grave ; but the sweetness of his temper , the placid kindness of his manner , and his benevolent solicitude for her , if they were capable of any increase , were increased .
i knowed old squire tom , sir .
i lifted up the leaden hand , and held it to my heart ; and all the world seemed death and silence , broken only by his mothers moaning .
it wasnt any impudence from any of them male paupers as-- no , no , love !
i ask , because i take an interest in you ; and because i believe i was your friend when you had no other who could serve you .
but she is wholly and entirely dependent upon the pleasure of my grandfather ; and if he were to know that she favoured my passion , she would lose her home and everything she possesses in the world .
i should think she couldnt wery well be off o that , said sam .
i am at your disposal .
the pope made reginald pole a cardinal ; but , so much against his will , that it is thought he even aspired in his own mind to the vacant throne of england , and had hopes of marrying the princess mary .
the former would have been easy , but very ineffectual ; the latter seemed very difficult , but , if accomplished , very effectual .
your other self !
the culprit falters excuses , and professes a determination to do better tomorrow .
handle them never so lightly , and they fell to pieces with such ease that you might suspect them of having been flawed before .
you dont mean to say that there is any affinity between nautical matters and ecclesiastical matters ?
said that gentleman ; i have dropped my whip .
and this brings me to a point on which i have , ever since i landed in the united states last november , observed a strict silence , though sometimes tempted to break it , but in reference to which i will , with your good leave , take you into my confidence now .
winkle , deeply affected .
ruth , my love !
i beg your pardon , observed my aunt with a keen look .
she darted to him , and caught him by the hand .
it became important now that the king himself should be married ; and divers foreign monarchs , not very particular about the character of their son-in-law , proposed their daughters to him .
it passed with me as i suppose it would with most people under such circumstances .
the hard-headed man looked dubiously round , but finding himself in a minority , assumed a compassionate air and said no more .
gradgrind , adjusting her shawls after the affectionate ceremony , i shall be worrying myself , morning , noon , and night , to know what i am to call him !
" for the last time !
we knows each others ways , and often gives relief when others fail .
if youve come down for a country life , come to me , and ill give you plenty of it .
i trip over another word .

traddles would be often at the bottom of the staircase , looking on , and taking charge of sportive messages from dora to the dearest girl in the world .
the wooden-legged man turned me about so as to exhibit the placard ; and having afforded time for a full survey of it , turned me about again , with my face to mr .
waldengarver , said the owner of that property , or youll bust em .
he took an extraordinary interest in her fortunes when he first happened to encounter her ; and we gather from the inquiries we have made of him , that it was she in whose behalf he made that turmoil which led to your first acquaintance .
and so the vision fadeth .
that would have been agreeable .
he had a good ear for wheels , and the trampling of hoofs ; but there appeared to be so many horses and carriages rattling towards them , from a distance , that it was impossible to form a guess at their number .
it would pain her very much to know that you were watching thus , said the bachelor .
the first goblin was a most astonishing leaper , and none of the others could come near him ; even in the extremity of his terror the sexton could not help observing , that while his friends were content to leap over the common-sized gravestones , the first one took the family vaults , iron railings and all , with as much ease as if they had been so many street-posts .
cruncher , in case he should observe any symptoms of her saying grace .
if you dont stop his mouth , youre not his friend !
you can tell father if you will .
mr pinch looked up into his face with increased interest .
but bless my soul , mark , said mr pinch , who in the progress of his observation just then made the discovery that the bosom of his companions shirt was as much exposed as if it was midsummer , and was ruffled by every breath of air , why dont you wear a waistcoat ?
just so had she first dimly seen the face which she now dimly saw again .
the night was not so dark but that , besides the lights at bows and mastheads gliding to and fro , they could discern some shadowy bulk attached ; and now and then a ghostly lighter with a large dark sail , like a warning arm , would start up very near them , pass on , and vanish .
i am entirely ignorant of it , and cannot be supposed likely to be able to form the remotest guess at its nature ; her habitual frown became stronger , as she very slowly and weightily emphasised those words ; but , when the gentleman proceeds to explain his object , as i shall beg him to have the goodness to do to myself and flintwinch , when flintwinch returns , it will prove , no doubt , to be one more or less in the usual way of our business , which it will be both our business and our pleasure to advance .
come on thursday fortnight , and bring the other chaps with you , said mr .
it is our duty so to do .
bless my soul , john , is it nothing to see a man moved to that extent and know ones self to be the cause !
you have come here to be educated , and taught a useful trade , said the red-faced gentleman in the high chair .
youd ha made an uncommon fine oyster , sammy , if youd been born in that station o life .
' she has pretty well settled that , in her own mind , already .
well , that certainly is most capital cold punch , said mr .
vapour ?
not for your sake , but for the sake of others .
a glass of something warm here !
i have known him set out in the night , on a misgiving that the light might not be , by some accident , in the window of the old boat , and walk to yarmouth .
the ungainly piece of honesty beamed and blushed as he said it , quite enraptured with the remembrance of having been serviceable .
" " miss summerson , ma ' am !
is he hurt ?
i intend to take jerry .
it made him shrink and shudder even now , when its faintest hum was hushed , and when the lines of iron road he could trace in the moonlight , running to a point , were as empty and as silent as a desert .
during this short colloquy , the active smallweed , who is of the dinner party , has written in legal characters on a slip of paper , " return immediately .
im blest if it aint , returned that gentleman .
cried kits mother , falling back in extreme surprise , only think of this !
proudly as she opposed herself to him , with her commanding face exacting his humility , her disdainful lip repulsing him , her bosom angry at his intrusion , and the dark lashes of her eyes sullenly veiling their light , that no ray of it might shine upon him--and submissively as he stood before her , with an entreating injured manner , but with complete submission to her will--she knew , in her own soul , that the cases were reversed , and that the triumph and superiority were his , and that he knew it full well .
he laid down his pen , and went off to seek paul , whom he found at last , after a long search , looking through the window of his little bedroom .
he was not a man of whom it could properly be said that he was ever startled , or shocked ; but he certainly had a sense within him , that if his wife should sicken and decay , he would be very sorry , and that he would find a something gone from among his plate and furniture , and other household possessions , which was well worth the having , and could not be lost without sincere regret .
cried her old friend with some archness .
we should be rather disposed to say that the result was attained by combining the two sources of consolation , for he repeated the second in a low tone , very frequently ; ringing the bell meanwhile , to order in the first .
it broke , a dreadful smell arose , the people hurried out into the air , and , for the third time , it was left alone .
i said i should be delighted to accept his hospitality .
ralph smiled again , but made no answer .
a beautiful show , sir , rejoined tacker .
the sitiwation of mrs kenwigs , sir , is no obstacle to a little conversation between you and me , i hope ?
here he is , said the doctor , entering the dark room at the moment .
you cant think how it pleases him .
a buzz then went round among the young gentlemen , of dombeys going !
bardell specially said , however , observed fogg , glancing at dodson , that she would not compromise for a farthing less .
bumbles heavy accusation .
we have none of us long to wait for death .
no description i could give of her would do justice to my recollection of her , or to her entire deliverance of herself to her anger .
ill tell you more , said fagin , after he had reassured the girl , by dint of friendly nods and muttered encouragements .
cruncher , who was all in a tremble , and who spoke with an ashy and solemn visage , them poor things well out o ' this , never no more will i do it , never no more !
i suppose it will cost money ?
we three went out of the prison and walked up and down at some short distance from the gate , which was in a retired place .
bumble , beginning at the bottom , proceeded to make himself acquainted with the contents of the three long drawers : which , being filled with various garments of good fashion and texture , carefully preserved between two layers of old newspapers , speckled with dried lavender : seemed to yield him exceeding satisfaction .
you didnt tell it right when you were sitting there .
[perpetual vice- president--member pickwick club] , presiding .
seated on it , against no more romantic object than a blackened chimney-stack over which some bumble creeper had been trained , they both pored over one book ; both with attentive faces ; jenny with the sharper ; lizzie with the more perplexed .
" " how changed it must be now !

he knocked the ashes out of his pipe , and put it on a ledge in the back of his chair , expressly made for its reception .
they had not walked many yards , before the major encountered somebody he knew , nor many yards farther before the major encountered somebody else he knew , but he merely shook his fingers at them as he passed , and led mr dombey on : pointing out the localities as they went , and enlivening the walk with any current scandal suggested by them .
i wish i had had the pleasure of seeing you before .
this figure was the first to perceive that mr .
' so do i , ' rejoined the undertaker .
all the girls were in tears and white muslin , except a select two or three , who were being honoured with a private view of the bride and bridesmaids , upstairs .

my heart is a little lightened when we turn towards it , even for a few miles , and with the knowledge that we are soon to turn away again .
three oclock !
snodgrass acknowledged the compliment .
he has talked upon religious matters with the gentleman who visits him , and has read his bible , and has written a prayer upon his slate , and hung it up as a kind of protection , and an assurance of heavenly companionship .
we have been--we have been--toasting your lovely daughter , mrs nickleby , whispered sir mulberry , sitting down behind her .
but you must tell me , lizzie , what is the matter ?
alfred , my darling alfred .
and now florence began to think , if she were to fall ill , if she were to fade like her dear brother , would he then know that she had loved him ; would she then grow dear to him ; would he come to her bedside , when she was weak and dim of sight , and take her into his embrace , and cancel all the past ?
i put up at the jolly sandboys and nowhere else .
' ' just so , ' rejoined the other , nodding his head .
cried tom pinch , faintly .
' i won ' t stand by and see it done , fagin , ' cried the girl .
but tom had thought of london before , and had coupled with it thoughts of his sister , and of his old friend john westlock , whose advice he naturally felt disposed to seek in this important crisis of his fortunes .
he said drugs , and never used any other word .
dora made him lie down by her , with a good deal of persuasion ; and when he was quiet , drew one of his long ears through and through her hand , repeating thoughtfully , even little jip !
and , i believe , said mrs todgers , putting back her handkerchief again , that she considers me a good friend too .
one of us is , said the owner of that name .
his coffee was produced , by the special activity of mr .
without any conciliation of him , scarcely addressing him , rather speaking as if she were speaking to her own looking-glass for the justification of her own stubbornness , she said , as she gave them to him : now you may know what i mean by hating !
it had once been noted at the bar , that while mr .
" as richard seemed quite willing , and even anxious , that we should see them safely to their destination , we agreed to do so .
it didnt come to a end there , said mr .
now , said squeers , giving the desk a great rap with his cane , which made half the little boys nearly jump out of their boots , is that physicking over ?
he held his breath , and listened at the key-hole .
i cant help thinking what he must have suffered himself .
i am pretty sure it ought to be .
a robbery of a daring and aggravated nature occasioned a vigilance of pursuit , and a strictness of search , they had not calculated on .
there , mr blandois !
and do you recollect them ?
therefore the precedents would seem to show that mr pecksniff had (as things go) good argument for what he said and might be permitted to say it , and did not say it presumptuously , vainly , or arrogantly , but in a spirit of high faith and great wisdom .
so after he had been a little while with ada , i went in and found my darling (as i knew she would be) prepared to consider him thoroughly right in whatever he said .
this gentleman had been in her company , i believe , but very seldom , and certainly had not seen her for many months .
you get the distressed lady , and the little child , and the attached servant , into the poor lodgings , dont you ?
whatever you can and will tell me .
i was more than ever frightened of myself , thinking anew of her against whom i was a witness , of the owner of chesney wold , of the new and terrible meaning of the old words now moaning in my ear like a surge upon the shore , " your mother , esther , was your disgrace , and you are hers .
sentence , transportation for life .
they had not traversed many steps of the long main staircase when he stopped , and stared at the roof and round at the walls .
bardell felt it proper to be agitated ; and as none of the three exactly knew whether under existing circumstances , any communication , otherwise than through dodson & fogg , ought to be held with mr .
what has come over you , my dear , in the name of goodness ?
the captain had his presentiments , too , sometimes , that he would come on such a day ; and one particular sunday , even ordered a double allowance of dinner , he was so sanguine .
" " krook ' s last lodger died there , " observes mr .
this would attract similar lights from various dark quarters , like so many insects , and a fresh consultation would be held .
she hasn ' t much strength in her , so i easily kept her quiet .
i think you scarcely understand who and what i am , mrs dombey .
talk to me of fiery dragons !
a wild destiny for that mother to have foreseen !
but ever while he laughs , he glances over his paralytic shoulder at mr .
do you see those grovelling and wandering eyes ?
is it justice with the bandage off her eyes , and without the sword and scales ?
you ' ve got a mark upon you somewheres or another , i suppose ?
he asked me , with his head on one side , and not looking at me , but looking in a listening way at the floor .
never , sir , rejoined pott , pot-valiant in a double sense--never .
when was the peace of mind of man or woman broken or disturbed by a warming-pan , which is in itself a harmless , a useful , and i will add , gentlemen , a comforting article of domestic furniture ?
snodgrass got into the bin ; mr .
the gentleman then beckoned to the young lady , and they , too , went out .
open your mouth and say wot youve got to say in plain words .
for it would be easy to see that she has always been brought up in a tender and happy home , even if she had not told me so with great love for it .
the old sydney carton of old shrewsbury school , said stryver , nodding his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the past , the old seesaw sydney .
with a scared face the younger man complies by casting his eyes downward at the ashes on the hearth .

then the question is-- the boy waited so long for the question , while the schoolmaster looked at a new side of his finger , and bit it , and looked at it again , that at length the boy repeated : the question is , sir-- ?
thank you , sir , returned wegg , as if there were nothing new in his reading at all .
pickwick had replaced on the table the glass which , during the last few sentences of the tale , he had retained in his hand ; and had just made up his mind to speak--indeed , we have the authority of mr .
another of the fathers says , speculated without knowing that speculation is a science .
he trembled very much though ; for , even in his terror , oliver could see that the knife quivered in the air .

the pretty old lady , after reading it , had just laid it down upon the breakfast-cloth .
oh thank god !
it would overcome me with joy to see them , but i dont think it would surprise me much , at first .
rosa thanked him , but said she could only take a cup of tea .
by heavens , its the couple , pickwick , exclaimed the old gentleman .
mr job potterson , mr inspector continued , i drink your health .
why , my dear , i said , i suppose its all very well ; i hope its for the best .
it was even harder than he could have believed possible , to separate in his own conscience his abandonment by all his fellows from a baseless sense of shame and disgrace .
' and what have you got , my dear ?
how many children sophy could have taken care of in her time , i cant imagine ; but she seemed to be famous for knowing every sort of song that ever was addressed to a child in the english tongue ; and she sang dozens to order with the clearest little voice in the world , one after another (every sister issuing directions for a different tune , and the beauty generally striking in last) , so that i was quite fascinated .
but what do you want with me ?
i don ' t regret that i have not a strong will and an immense power of business detail to throw myself into objects with surprising ardour .
but such a woman as mrs .
" another being brought , he falls to with great goodwill .
standing on a seat at the side of the hall , the better to peer into the curtained sanctuary , is a little mad old woman in a squeezed bonnet who is always in court , from its sitting to its rising , and always expecting some incomprehensible judgment to be given in her favour .
his eyes encountered jonas , who looked earnestly towards him , and moved his lips as if he were whispering .
to walk when we cant .
but , the stout earl of warwick leading for the young king , and the young king himself closely following him , and the english people crowding round the royal standard , the white and the red roses met , on a wild march day when the snow was falling heavily , at towton ; and there such a furious battle raged between them , that the total loss amounted to forty thousand men--all englishmen , fighting , upon english ground , against one another .
he paused for a moment before opening a door on the second story .
stars were yet visible , but there was dull light in the east that was not the light of night .
we must not shipwreck ada upon it .
the roads are closing so fast in every direction , that in a months time , unless my aunt sends me a remittance , i shall have to go three or four miles out of town to get over the way .
" " he is very weak , " said the trooper in a low voice .
after which he knocked again .
i am such a vagabond still , even at my present time of life , that i couldn ' t hold to the gallery a month together if it was a regular pursuit or if i didn ' t camp there , gipsy fashion .
cluppins , with sympathising resignation .
weller took it from the pocket-book .
' good-bye , boy , ' said the man .
now , fair !
truly eloquent indeed .
i consider it no unreasonable return for the worldly advancement that has befallen you ; and i believe nobody will be surprised , either at its being required from you , or at your making it .

monsieur defarge sold a very thin wine at the best of times , but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that he sold at this time .
where was it ?
the lanterns glimmered , as the men ran to and fro ; the horses hoofs clattered on the uneven paving of the yard ; the chaise rumbled as it was drawn out of the coach-house ; and all was noise and bustle .
really the person should be more care- wait !
nor yet your mother .
another blank .
cried john westlock , with the utmost disgust and disdain the monosyllable is capable of expressing .
" caddy was not at all deficient in natural affection for her mother , but mentioned this with tears as an undeniable fact , which i am afraid it was .
there could have been no such revolution , if all laws , forms , and ceremonies , had not first been so monstrously abused , that the suicidal vengeance of the revolution was to scatter them all to the winds .
hes in the parlour , reading , is he , jane ?
a year and more , said alice , thoughtfully intent upon her face .

have i lost my smell for fruits , or is it a apple pie , sir ?
(a cry of it is , and great cheering .
bumble stepped in ; and ordering something to drink , as he passed the bar , entered the apartment into which he had looked from the street .
he was young--one-and-twenty , perhaps--and handsome ; with a keen dark eye , and a quickness of look and manner which made tom sensible of a great contrast in his own bearing , and caused him to feel even more shy than usual .
it may be the companionship of the nightly stir , or it may be the companionship of the gin and beer that slop about among carters and hucksters , or it may be the companionship of the trodden vegetable refuse which is so like their own dress that perhaps they take the market for a great wardrobe ; but be it what it may , you shall see no such individual drunkards on doorsteps anywhere , as there .
micawber has accepted ?
he no more gathers grapes from thorns or figs from thistles than older men did in old times .

mantalini had got by this time into the passage , and was making his way to the door of ralphs office with very little ceremony , when newman interposed his body ; and hinting that mr .
he warnt one of the family , at that time ; and one night he was robbed of three hundred and twenty-seven guineas in a canvas bag , that was stole out of his bedroom in the dead of night , by a tall man with a black patch over his eye , who had concealed himself under the bed , and after committing the robbery , jumped slap out of window : which was only a story high .
spenlow solemnly , in conclusion ; but when the price of wheat per bushel had been highest , the commons had been busiest ; and a man might lay his hand upon his heart , and say this to the whole world , --touch the commons , and down comes the country !
' now listen to me , ' said the dying woman aloud , as if making a great effort to revive one latent spark of energy .
ahh !
god bless you , pip , old chap !
a murmur of voices had been audible on the outside , and , at the moment of our entrance , a clapping of hands : which latter noise , i was surprised to see , proceeded from the generally disconsolate mrs .

weller , junior .
its down by blackheath , he said .
in some old battle-fields , british spear-heads and roman armour have been found , mingled together in decay , as they fell in the thick pressure of the fight .
we will go and see the lions for an hour or two--its something to have a fresh fellow like you to show them to , copperfield--and then well journey out to highgate by the coach .
secondly , because wherever there was a square yard of ground in british occupation under the sun or moon , with a public post upon it , sticking to that post was a barnacle .

before , and after them , i walked about--supervised , as i have mentioned , by the man with the wooden leg .
this occurred so often , that kit , nothing doubting but that they came from the single gentleman who had already rewarded his mother with great liberality , could not enough admire his generosity ; and bought so many cheap presents for her , and for little jacob , and for the baby , and for barbara to boot , that one or other of them was having some new trifle every day of their lives .
" returned the boy , with all his might of wonder .
shall i incommode you , if i put mine up too ?
the best way is to keep gently up with the object of pursuit , to be wary and cautious , to watch your opportunity well , get gradually before it , then make a rapid dive , seize it by the crown , and stick it firmly on your head ; smiling pleasantly all the time , as if you thought it as good a joke as anybody else .
micawber , god bless you !
the master refusing to entertain the subject until the journeyman was in a better temper , orlick plunged at the furnace , drew out a red-hot bar , made at me with it as if he were going to run it through my body , whisked it round my head , laid it on the anvil , hammered it out , as if it were i , i thought , and the sparks were my spirting blood , and finally said , when he had hammered himself hot and the iron cold , and he again leaned on his hammer , now , master !

in answer to which message , the native brought back a very small note with a very large quantity of scent about it , indited by the honourable mrs skewton to major bagstock , and briefly saying , you are a shocking bear and i have a great mind not to forgive you , but if you are very good indeed , which was underlined , you may come .

bounderbys house stood .
from out the most spare and hungry room in all this spare and hungry house there came , one morning , the tremulous tones of old grides voice , as it feebly chirruped forth the fag end of some forgotten song , of which the burden ran : ta--ran--tan--too , throw the old shoe , and may the wedding be lucky !
the waiter returned , and ushered three gentlemen into the room .

but , quickly recovering his self-possession , he threw down his stick and book , and dropping on one knee beside her , endeavoured , by such simple means as occurred to him , to restore her to herself ; while her grandfather , standing idly by , wrung his hands , and implored her with many endearing expressions to speak to him , were it only a word .
liberty and hope would be so dear , bought at such a price , that i could never support their weight , never bear the reproach of possessing them .
this done , mr .
he found himself in a little floor-clothed room , with a high desk railed off in one corner , behind which sat a lean youth with cunning eyes and a protruding chin , whose performances in capital-text darkened the window .

i took agnes in my arm to the back of her chair , and we both leaned over her .

a few more horrors , and this reign is over .
poor fellow , he is always disposed to do his best ; but he is not gifted .
they walked about the city for two or three hours ; seeing it from the best points of view , and pausing in the principal streets , and before such public buildings as mr bevan pointed out .
bounderby ; you wont do so any more .
its oh do and oh do .
(his last teeth , he explained to the company , are going , poor old boy .
is there nothing you can tell me if you will ?
i have been expecting him , said mrs plornish , this half an hour , at any minute of time .
ill knock , i swear , till i have your neighbours up in arms , said ralph , if you dont tell me what you mean by lurking there , you whining cur .
you know , returned clennam , with a bitter sense of his helplessness , that when i sought you , i was not a prisoner .

and he faintly understands , poor mr toots , that they are saying something of a time when he was sensible of being brighter and not addle-brained ; and the tears rising in his eyes when he fears that he is dull and stupid now , and good for little but to be laughed at , diminish his satisfaction in their soothing reminder that he is relieved from present responsibility to the chicken , by the absence of that game head of poultry in the country , training (at tootss cost) for his great mill with the larkey boy .
you are always welcome .
the clock was wrong .
it is our pride , not our trouble , to strive , john , and to strive together !
bella helped him with his supplemental cookery , and made him very happy , but put him in mortal terror too by asking him when they sat down at table again , how he supposed they cooked fowls at the greenwich dinners , and whether he believed they really were such pleasant dinners as people said ?
make this known .
not even by marriage .
calm , tranquil night was reigning in its stead .
by that time we were so anxious and nervous that even richard confessed , as we rattled over the stones of the old street , to feeling an irrational desire to drive back again .
weller began to speak ; it wanted but a feather to turn the scale , and old fireworks did it .
quite right !
said tom ; what is the matter ?
you were talking of tampering , just now .
i assure you she is , my lord , returned mrs .
her eyes were swollen and red ; she rocked herself to and fro ; tossed her head ; and , after a little time , burst out laughing .
he stood close beside me at an open window , his eyes looking in my face , and his hand laid upon my arm .
chillip , smiling very meekly , and shaking his head as he surveyed me , i have a kind of an impression that something in your countenance is familiar to me , sir ; but i couldnt lay my hand upon your name , really .
there was more that she might have said ; more that she knew , or that she suspected ; i clearly saw .
the brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed , elicited from him that he was thinking of an animal , a live animal , rather a disagreeable animal , a savage animal , an animal that growled and grunted sometimes , and talked sometimes , and lived in london , and walked about the streets , and wasn ' t made a show of , and wasn ' t led by anybody , and didn ' t live in a menagerie , and was never killed in a market , and was not a horse , or an ass , or a cow , or a bull , or a tiger , or a dog , or a pig , or a cat , or a bear .

while the meal was in progress , their host remarked that the old man seemed much fatigued , and evidently stood in need of rest .
wet through and through : with her feet squelching and squashing in her shoes whenever she moved ; with a rash of rain upon her classical visage ; with a bonnet like an over-ripe fig ; with all her clothes spoiled ; with damp impressions of every button , string , and hook-and-eye she wore , printed off upon her highly connected back ; with a stagnant verdure on her general exterior , such as accumulates on an old park fence in a mouldy lane ; mrs .
miss fanny understood , with particular distinctness , that mrs gowans good looks had cost her husband very dear ; that there had been a great disturbance about her in the barnacle family ; and that the dowager mrs gowan , nearly heart-broken , had resolutely set her face against the marriage until overpowered by her maternal feelings .
on the second story you will find mr .
there being to my knowledge a respectable lodging-house in essex street , the back of which looked into the temple , and was almost within hail of my windows , i first of all repaired to that house , and was so fortunate as to secure the second floor for my uncle , mr .
this is to be accepted in a double sense , for he contrived a back to his wooden stool , by placing it against the lamp-post .
she was surrounded by boats , and we said how glad the people on board of her must be to come ashore .
grummers mode of proceeding was professional , but peculiar .

this touch and go young barnacle had got up the department in a private secretaryship , that he might be ready for any little bit of fat that came to hand ; and he fully understood the department to be a politico-diplomatic hocus pocus piece of machinery for the assistance of the nobs in keeping off the snobs .
she hands him the nearly-emptied pipe , and sinks back , turning over on her face .

to think of that old gate now !
i heard , with pity and compassion , the repentant man devise a thousand little plans for her comfort and support when he returned ; but i knew that many months before he could reach his place of destination , his mother would be no longer of this world .
i nodded at him , and he nodded back again .

august has no such advantage .
my guardian , with his sweet temper and his quick perception and his amiable face , made something agreeable even out of the ungenial company .
mine , replied smike , as the yorkshireman hurried him to the adjoining room , and pointed out a pair of shoes and a coat which were lying on a chair .
what is this ?
i was solemnly interdicted by her , on her recovery , from touching my brother any more on any pretence whatever ; and my poor mother , who , i could see , wished otherwise , meekly confirmed the interdict , by saying : no doubt you are right , my dear jane .

this led to mr .
when he had finished , she said nothing but these words : you have not yet told me , sir , what i have to do with it , or what the favour is ?
miss rose !

i desire my friend slyme to be present at the remainder of this conference .
that is not all .

snagsby looking at mrs .
there , he said jokingly , im coming here again next monday at the same time , and mind youre here , my lad , to work it out .
but mind you are not made uneasy by this , for she was very well and very happy .
these two chambers , close as to their atmosphere , and swarthy as to their illumination by natural light , were the apartments which mrs .

" he signs to him with his hand not to go away .
well then , misses brown .
" no , it was true .
he never changes them .
millers a conceited coxcomb , and you may tell him i said so .
she said , turning on me with her lightning eyes .
illness had not improved mr .
it is so deplorably underhanded , said mortimer .
why , no considerable change has taken place in the state of my system , since i see you cocked up behind your governors chair in the parlour , a little vile ago , replied sam .
he went to india with his capital , and there , according to a wild legend in our family , he was once seen riding on an elephant , in company with a baboon ; but i think it must have been a baboo--or a begum .
i think i could not , at another time , sir ; but i am sure i did .
on my politely bidding him good-morning , he said , pompously , seven times nine , boy ?
the slight , the very slight , confusion apparent in these expressions is manifest , and is ludicrously easy of correction .
the consumption of tobacco in these towns , continues mr .
the door still had an attraction for him at intervals ; and he went snuffing about it , and growling to himself , unable to forget the subject .
that was very thoughtful !
oh dear , no , replied ben allen .
ah , shes a clever girl , my dears , said the jew , turning round to his young friends , and shaking his head gravely , as if in mute admonition to them to follow the bright example they had just beheld .
how to my father , mr wrayburn ?
oh yes , you may come in , returned her brother .

some mistake , said mr .
that i know nothing of it .

as they would leave the house very early in the morning , the child was anxious to pay for their entertainment before they retired to bed .

even in running away , however , whisker was perverse , for he had not gone very far when he suddenly stopped , and before assistance could be rendered , commenced backing at nearly as quick a pace as he had gone forward .
mantalini turned round , caught sight of kate , and , without another word , leapt at one bound into a bed which stood behind the door , and drew the counterpane over his face : kicking meanwhile convulsively .

he took his usual seat , she took hers , and he began his meal .
mrs general was in her pure element .
but betray the lovely woman , and you shall find her a serpent .
it was much upon my mind (particularly when i first saw him looking about for his file) that i ought to tell joe the whole truth .
this was a charming idea , and having fully discussed it , the friends parted .
well avoid these precious morsels of morality if you please , and talk of business .
barkis , do you mean ?
the military band outside the building struck up god save the queen with great vigour before his excellency had quite finished ; the people shouted ; the ins rubbed their hands ; the outs shook their heads ; the government party said there never was such a good speech ; the opposition declared there never was such a bad one ; the speaker and members of the house of assembly withdrew from the bar to say a great deal among themselves and do a little : and , in short , everything went on , and promised to go on , just as it does at home upon the like occasions .
he then demanded .

not that anybody means to try , she added , for thats all done with , and the place will stand as idle as it is till it falls .

he will start upon his journey to-morrow night .
then mr boffin , with his stick at his ear , like a familiar spirit explaining the office to him , sat staring at a little bookcase of law practice and law reports , and at a window , and at an empty blue bag , and at a stick of sealing-wax , and a pen , and a box of wafers , and an apple , and a writing-pad--all very dusty--and at a number of inky smears and blots , and at an imperfectly-disguised gun-case pretending to be something legal , and at an iron box labelled harmon estate , until mr lightwood appeared .

however , it being the couriers business to get him out of the hands of the banditti , the courier brought him off at every stage ; and so the red-jackets went gleaming merrily along the spring landscape , rising and falling to a regular measure , between mr dorrit in his snug corner and the next chalky rise in the dusty highway .

she began her reign with the great advantage of having a very wise and careful minister , sir william cecil , whom she afterwards made lord burleigh .
the darkness and the mist had vanished with it , for it was a clear , cold , winter day , with snow upon the ground .
as mr pecksniff ceased to speak , she hung her head , and dropped a tear upon his hand .
stay here , he replied .
these continual references to mr carker the junior , mr carker the manager began , as soon as they were alone , are , to a man in my position , uttered before one in yours , so unspeakably distressing-- nonsense , carker , mr dombey interrupted .
i shall be fur away , he repeated slowly .
newman cast a despairing glance at his small store of fuel , but , not having the courage to say no--a word which in all his life he never had said at the right time , either to himself or anyone else--gave way to the proposed arrangement .

the jew , smiling hideously , patted oliver on the head , and said , that if he kept himself quiet , and applied himself to business , he saw they would be very good friends yet .
he said his spirit was up , and wouldnt endure this .
ill see fair between you .

this time he does touch her with his outstretched hand .
joe stood staring ; at which crisis i partially recovered the use of my senses .
wititterly took up the prostrate form of mrs .
i hold myself quite at your disposal .

nothing but the respect and obligation i owe to you , sir-- as it was plain that sampson was bent on a complimentary harangue , unless he received a timely interruption , mr quilp politely tapped him on the crown of his head with the little saucepan , and requested that he would be so obliging as to hold his peace .
he wished to do anything as laid in his power to serve miss dorrit , altogether putting himself out of sight ; and he hoped he did .
" of all his playful speeches (playful , yet always fully meaning what they expressed) none seemed to be more to the taste of mr .
the procession up the aisle was beautiful .
i had the strongest assurances that i should save him ; and i did .
eminently so , was mr dombeys answer .
i couldnt return to him , she said , with an instinctive reference to his having forced her marriage on .
i did mean it .
i will carry it into no blood but my own ; and the reproach shall rest alone on me .
elevated thus to the godmothership of little paul , in virtue of her insignificance , miss tox was from that hour chosen and appointed to office ; and mr dombey further signified his pleasure that the ceremony , already long delayed , should take place without further postponement .

" why , my dear miss clare , " he returned , " i think they may perhaps understand each other ; but you will see them soon , i dare say , and i must learn from you on such a point--not you from me .
she and her husband came in immediately afterwards .
continued miss squeers , who , being excited , aspirated her hs strongly ; this is the hend , is it , of all my forbearance and friendship for that double-faced thing--that viper , that--that--mermaid ?
the curse of those occasions is heavy upon me , for i always remember them .
nothing at all , my lad , replied the captain , shaking his head .
but , he was particular in stipulating that if i were not received with cordiality , or if i were not encouraged to repeat my visit as a visit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude for a favour received , then this experimental trip should have no successor .
mr tigg received this declaration with a grave request that mr pinch would have the goodness to make it again ; and on toms repeating it in a still more emphatic and unmistakable manner , checked it off , sentence for sentence , by nodding his head solemnly at the end of each .
you say the suit is changing me ; john jarndyce says it changes , has changed , and will change everybody who has any share in it .

that a young woman earnestly asks to speak to miss maylie alone , said nancy ; and that if the lady will only hear the first word she has to say , she will know whether to hear her business , or to have her turned out of doors as an impostor .

what surprise , he asked , keeping his left hand over his heart , and there stopping in his speech , while with his right hand he put his glasses exactly level on the table : what such surprise can be in store for me ?

kit stood his ground as if in expectation of an immediate assault , but finding that nothing came of these gestures , snapped his fingers and walked away ; his mother dragging him off as fast as she could , and , even in the midst of his news of little jacob and the baby , looking anxiously over her shoulder to see if quilp were following .

chapter _num_ officiates as a kind of gentleman usher , in bringing various people together the storm had long given place to a calm the most profound , and the evening was pretty far advanced--indeed supper was over , and the process of digestion proceeding as favourably as , under the influence of complete tranquillity , cheerful conversation , and a moderate allowance of brandy-and-water , most wise men conversant with the anatomy and functions of the human frame will consider that it ought to have proceeded , when the three friends , or as one might say , both in a civil and religious sense , and with proper deference and regard to the holy state of matrimony , the two friends , (mr .

flora was so sorry to have kept her waiting , and good gracious why did she sit out there in the cold when she had expected to find her by the fire reading the paper , and hadnt that heedless girl given her the message then , and had she really been in her bonnet all this time , and pray for goodness sake let flora take it off !

returned the jack .
i only wanted that point to be all square and straight between us .

just , replied the fat boy .
why , as to that , rejoined tigg , it certainly is a difficult question .
sometimes these correspondents assumed facetious names , as the brick , bellows , old gooseberry , wideawake , snooks , mops , cutaway , the dogs-meat man ; but he considered this in bad taste , and was always a little hurt by it .

its a considerable invasion of a mans jollity to be made so partickler welcome , but a werb is a word as signifies to be , to do , or to suffer (which is all the grammar , and enough too , as ever i wos taught) ; and if theres a werb alive , im it .

presently afterwards , young john disappeared into the jail .
she had an affectionate and gentle heart , he said ; and it was broken .
he had read many books ; and scotts poetry appeared to have left a strong impression on his mind : especially the opening of the lady of the lake , and the great battle scene in marmion , in which , no doubt from the congeniality of the subjects to his own pursuits and tastes , he had great interest and delight .

it is the fashion , growled the man .

he is often very nervous--or i fancy so .
when he was tired with play i took him back to the table , and he was quite ready to begin again his process of imitation .

i was marvellously changed .

whose name , tom , said mr .
but , if i do no violence to any of them , here--i may !
this old lady had a grandson who was a sailor , and i wrote a letter to him for her and drew at the top of it the chimney-corner in which she had brought him up and where his old stool yet occupied its old place .

the collector fell back in his chair in the intensity of his astonishment .

not to divide with lucie her privilege as your child , companion , and friend ; but to come in aid of it , and bind her closer to you , if such a thing can be .
but , as years went on , my dear boy would have wearied of his child-wife .
a very good substitute for it , at all events , replied mr .
returns wegg , with a greedy relish .
said the king of the goblins , in a more contemptuous tone than before .
i wanted to see how you would come out of the trial , trot ; and you came out nobly--persevering , self-reliant , self-denying !
s neckin other words , breaking his bell short offand silencing that young gentleman , as to my experience and belief , for ever .
the other bird remained as before , except for an impatient glance at the basket .
i set off one morning , accompanied by charley , for somers town .
the more youll want me .

clennam said--not very plainly , seeing those tears glistening in her anxious eyes--that her wish should be sacred with him .
but appearing to remark that mr .

mrs boffin laughed heartily at herself ; but a certain glistening in her honest eyes revealed that she was by no means cured of that dangerous propensity .
yes , i thought it was yours , said mr sparkler .
joe threw his eye over them , and pronounced that the job would necessitate the lighting of his forge fire , and would take nearer two hours than one .

" aye , if you like .
returned the angry mother .
said uriah , with an oath .

he did not gather his eyebrows together , for he had none worth mentioning ; but he frowned to that degree that he almost closed his small eyes , while the hurried raising of his grisly hand to his chin betrayed some trepidation or surprise .
if i take her in hand , i will be bound by a very little coaxing and threatening to bend her to my will .
you know what i am going to say .
interrupted the other , rolling his eye over the landscape .
thats not it ?

alexandre manette , physician .

" " i don ' t find any fault , child--but not to ease my mind , george ?
but as i didnt feel inclined for dinner , i let mrs merdle go by herself just as we were getting into the carriage , and thought id take a stroll instead .
nothing was needed but this ; the wretched man , after loading wretched me with his gold and silver chains for years , had risked his life to come to me , and i held it there in my keeping !

giving the child an encouraging look , intended to reassure her and let her know , that , although she stood in the presence of the original jarley , she must not allow herself to be utterly overwhelmed and borne down , the lady of the caravan unfolded another scroll , whereon was the inscription , one hundred figures the full size of life , and then another scroll , on which was written , the only stupendous collection of real wax-work in the world , and then several smaller scrolls with such inscriptions as now exhibiting within--the genuine and only jarley--jarleys unrivalled collection--jarley is the delight of the nobility and gentry--the royal family are the patrons of jarley .
in this depressed state of the classical market , mrs jarley made extraordinary efforts to stimulate the popular taste , and whet the popular curiosity .

i entirely disapprove of your doing anything for him , my dear sir , which is not dependent on his own exertions and good conduct .
little kate nickleby were the words that caught his ear .
i hope so , aunt .

walter related to him what had happened ; and the difficulty in which he felt respecting his uncle , and the relief it would be to him if captain cuttle , in his kindness , would help him to smooth it away ; captain cuttles infinite consternation and astonishment at the prospect unfolded to him , gradually swallowing that gentleman up , until it left his face quite vacant , and the suit of blue , the glazed hat , and the hook , apparently without an owner .

we have talked it over a good deal , her uncle and myself , and her sweetheart and myself , after business ; and i consider it is principally on account of her being unsettled .
there are other duties , mr .
' oliver made no reply .
this was addressed to mr meagles , who sorrowfully went out .
and he had plenty of unsettled subjects to meditate upon , though he had been walking to the lands end .

the merry old gentleman , placing a snuff-box in one pocket of his trousers , a note-case in the other , and a watch in his waistcoat pocket , with a guard-chain round his neck , and sticking a mock diamond pin in his shirt : buttoned his coat tight round him , and putting his spectacle-case and handkerchief in his pockets , trotted up and down the room with a stick , in imitation of the manner in which old gentlemen walk about the streets any hour in the day .

at the end of the first verse , as though some person without had waited until then to make himself audible , was heard a loud and violent knocking at the street-door ; so loud and so violent , indeed , that the ladies started as by one accord , and john browdie stopped .

those proofs were destroyed by you , and now , in your own words to your accomplice the jew , " _the only proofs of the boy ' s identity lie at the bottom of the river , and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin_ .

squeers made a plunge into the crowd , and at one dive , caught a very little boy , habited still in his night-gear , and the perplexed expression of whose countenance , as he was brought forward , seemed to intimate that he was as yet uncertain whether he was about to be punished or rewarded for the suggestion .

disturbed in their orgies , the party broke up ; some reeled away with looks of tipsy gravity ; others withdrew noisily discussing what had just occurred ; the gentlemen of honour who lived upon their winnings remarked to each other , as they went out , that hawk was a good shot ; and those who had been most noisy , fell fast asleep upon the sofas , and thought no more about it .
ralph relieved her from her perplexity by taking his departure without delay : madame mantalini making many gracious inquiries why he never came to see them ; and mr .

mr dombey , who had been so long shut up within himself , and who had rarely , at any time , overstepped the enchanted circle within which the operations of dombey and son were conducted , began to think this an improvement on his solitary life ; and in place of excusing himself for another day , as he had thought of doing when alone , walked out with the major arm-in-arm .

it was quite enough , she said , that she had told me agnes was going to be married ; and that i now knew better than anyone how true it was .

when she had administered these restoratives , as i was still quite hysterical , and unable to control my sobs , she put me on the sofa , with a shawl under my head , and the handkerchief from her own head under my feet , lest i should sully the cover ; and then , sitting herself down behind the green fan or screen i have already mentioned , so that i could not see her face , ejaculated at intervals , mercy on us !
the strong-room excited his especial admiration ; but , that he might not appear too particular , he limited himself to an approving glance , and , with a graceful recognition of the clerks as a body , that was full of politeness and patronage , passed out into the court .

lastly , ophelia was a prey to such slow musical madness , that when , in course of time , she had taken off her white muslin scarf , folded it up , and buried it , a sulky man who had been long cooling his impatient nose against an iron bar in the front row of the gallery , growled , now the babys put to bed lets have supper !

mr richard swivellers apartments were in the neighbourhood of drury lane , and in addition to this convenience of situation had the advantage of being over a tobacconists shop , so that he was enabled to procure a refreshing sneeze at any time by merely stepping out upon the staircase , and was saved the trouble and expense of maintaining a snuff-box .

therefore , setting aside all question of reality or unreality between us , i represented to him that whoever thoroughly discharged his duty must do well , and that at least it was his comfort that he understood his duty , though he did not understand these confounding appearances .
ralph nickleby and gride , stunned and paralysed by the awful event which had so suddenly overthrown their schemes (it would not otherwise , perhaps , have made much impression on them) , and carried away by the extraordinary energy and precipitation of nicholas , which bore down all before him , looked on at these proceedings like men in a dream or trance .
besides , my dearest edith will be her natural and constant guardian when you return , and i had better not encroach upon her trust , perhaps .

the gentleman of military exterior had so imperfectly awakened clennams curiosity , in the existing state of his mind , that a half-forgetfulness of such a visitors having been referred to , was already creeping over it as a part of the sombre veil which almost always dimmed it now , when a heavy footstep on the stairs aroused him .
woodcourt gave him the strongest assurances that he did him no injustice .

the moment he saw little dorrit , he passed her briskly , said with his finger to his nose (as mrs affery distinctly heard) , pancks the gipsy , fortune-telling , and went away .
repeated mr riderhood , growing intentionally slower of comprehension as the other quickened in his speech .
biddy said no more .
the foot of the bed , which was very close to the fire , answered for a sideboard ; and when he had completed these preparations , he squeezed an old arm-chair into the warmest corner , and sat down to enjoy himself .

brownlow went on , from day to day , filling the mind of his adopted child with stores of knowledge , and becoming attached to him , more and more , as his nature developed itself , and showed the thriving seeds of all he wished him to become--how he traced in him new traits of his early friend , that awakened in his own bosom old remembrances , melancholy and yet sweet and soothing--how the two orphans , tried by adversity , remembered its lessons in mercy to others , and mutual love , and fervent thanks to him who had protected and preserved them--these are all matters which need not to be told .

thus , with her gentle nature yearning to them both , feeling for the misery of both , and whispering doubts of her own duty to both , florence in her wider and expanded love , and by the side of edith , endured more than when she had hoarded up her undivided secret in the mournful house , and her beautiful mama had never dawned upon it .

he smooths it out upon the table with his heavy palm , and thoughtfully walking up and down the gallery , makes a halt before it every now and then to come upon it with a fresh eye .

i walked through the streets ; and , once more seeing my old adversary the butcher--now a constable , with his staff hanging up in the shop--went down to look at the place where i had fought him ; and there meditated on miss shepherd and the eldest miss larkins , and all the idle loves and likings , and dislikings , of that time .
" repeal it , my dear sir ?
there is that in the indolent mortimer , which seems to hint that if good society might on any account allow itself to be impressible , he , one of good society , might have the weakness to be impressed by what he here relates .

" he is alive , at any rate , " says mr .
as a woman , returned john .
you rendered us a very important service this morning , sir , said he , will you allow us to offer a slight mark of our gratitude by begging the favour of your company at dinner ?
at every meal , moral influence alone restrains the more violent among them from cutting the throats of the rest ; but the effect of that influence is reduced to an absolute certainty , and is found , even as a means of restraint , to say nothing of it as a means of cure , a hundred times more efficacious than all the strait-waistcoats , fetters , and handcuffs , that ignorance , prejudice , and cruelty have manufactured since the creation of the world .

i confronted the maid in the chambers in lincoln ' s inn fields with a witness who had been lady dedlock ' s guide , and there couldn ' t be the shadow of a doubt that she had worn the young woman ' s dress , unknown to her .
cried that unfortunate gentleman .

the old man lifted up his eyes again , with one grave look at wrayburn , and one grave glance at lizzie , as she stood looking down .

brownlow had sold off his goods , and gone to the west indies , six weeks before .
richard swiveller , therefore , sticking a pen behind each ear , and carrying another in his mouth as a token of his great importance and devotion to business , hurried out to meet and treat with the single gentleman .

florence passed him as if she were in a dream , and hurried upstairs .
he started as they passed the angle of the trench--it looked like a colossal grave .
with this , number twenty eight retired , after a glance between him and uriah ; as if they were not altogether unknown to each other , through some medium of communication ; and a murmur went round the group , as his door shut upon him , that he was a most respectable man , and a beautiful case .

said mr feeder .
brownlow ; what of him ?
do you observe ?
i was dreaming at a great rate , and am glad to be disturbed from an indigestive after-dinner sleep .
i deplored the untimely death of mr .
pickwick , running forward and grasping wardles hand , my dear friend , pray , for heavens sake , explain to this lady the unfortunate and dreadful situation in which i am placed .
' the man struggled violently , to release his arms ; but those of the girl were clasped round his , and tear her as he would , he could not tear them away .

a father asking pardon of his child , said mr pecksniff , is , i believe , a spectacle to soften the most rugged nature .
wemmick , pleaded mike .

poor sweet dear !
" " but it is a terrible misfortune , guardian .
boy !
taking a mans nightcap from his brow by violent means , and adjusting it on the head of an unknown gentleman , of dirty exterior , however ingenious a witticism in itself , is unquestionably one of those which come under the denomination of practical jokes .

the very servants grinned with pleasure at sight of mr .
if he could lean upon anybodys arm , he would come to me , i know , he said , returning into the room .
but , lord clifford had stabbed the second son of the duke of york--not the first .
lady dedlock has taken a fancy to the pretty girl and is going to keep her about her own fair person--an honour which my young friend himself does not at all appreciate .

mantalini had not yet gathered it all up , when a ring was heard at the bell , and immediately afterwards newman ushered in no less a person than madame mantalini , at sight of whom mr mantalini evinced considerable discomposure , and swept the cash into his pocket with remarkable alacrity .

yes , this is it , said sam .
it was an inconvenient and exacting institution , as requiring everything in the universe to be filed down and fitted to it .
her eyes wandered restlessly over the distant prospect , and she bit her nether lip to stop that busy mouth .

i--i--am used to be alone , said florence .
shropshire , said the bold mild man , finding himself appealed to .
he procured a pipe from a neighbouring public-house , and smoked it , looking in at the railings and maturely considering the spot .
a prison taint was on everything there .
whereat scrooge ' s niece ' s sister--the plump one with the lace tucker : not the one with the roses--blushed .
i think it would hardly serve her to establish her parentage for the information of her husband , and to drag her back to disgrace , after an escape of twenty years , pretty secure to last for life .
smauker ; i promised bantam .
pardon me , forgive me !
at length , much to my relief , my aunt and mr .
observed mr pecksniff .
but as i couldnt wound him in what he has not , and in what he knows nothing of , except in his ability to probe them to the quick in other people , i am afraid i can lay no claim to your compliment .
at which each shuddered from head to foot , and said , oh , perch !
pickwick , looking at his watch .
i ask you again , thundered the doctor , are you , on your solemn oaths , able to identify that boy ?
pickwick , in the same tone .
in fact , a couple of very good country agencies happening to come up to town , at the same time , an agreeable little party had been got together to meet them , comprising mr .
weller ; presenting the singular phenomenon of an elderly gentleman , dripping wet , and without a hat , with his arms bound down to his sides , skimming over the ground , without any clearly-defined purpose , at the rate of six good english miles an hour .
' i have heard enough , already , to assure me that you are the man i ought to talk to .
as it came nearer , i saw it to be magwitch , swimming , but not swimming freely .
she wanders about in the night , and then lays hands on such food as she takes .
nothing wrong , mortimer ?
plays the organ for nothing , sir .
mann , coaxingly .
thrice in the ensuing night , but no return of bradley .
angry !
thereupon she is pleased to compliment .
the prince , himself , going into spain to head the army of relief , soon set pedro on his throne again--where he no sooner found himself , than , of course , he behaved like the villain he was , broke his word without the least shame , and abandoned all the promises he had made to the black prince .
" " well , and you never heard any harm of it !
what does my sister say to that ?
who , indeed , pa !
it was swept and garnished for the reception of a visitor .
among the trees and not far from the residence he pointed out the spire of the little church of which he had spoken .
my right hand was not so badly burnt but that i could move the fingers .
poor fellow , said nicholas , tapping gently at his door , what can be the cause of all this ?
coals !
he said , i thought so .
and wot are you a-goin to do , the while ?
' the reason of all this , ' replied fagin .
" i saw a young lady of that name not long ago .
the child asked how he was , and hoped he was better .
the room was lighted for their reception .
the housebreaker was lying on the bed , wrapped in his white great-coat , by way of dressing-gown , and displaying a set of features in no degree improved by the cadaverous hue of illness , and the addition of a soiled nightcap , and a stiff , black beard of a week ' s growth .
winkle said nothing , but he fixed his eyes on grummer , and bestowed a look upon him , which , if he had had any feeling , must have pierced his brain .
but neither the apprehensions which he plainly entertained , at times , for his life , nor the great pain he underwent , influenced his resolution in the least degree .
in that new presence she would have been bashful enough under any circumstances , and particularly under floras insisting on her drinking a glass of wine and eating of the best that was there ; but her constraint was greatly increased by mr pancks .
ha--you surprise me .
winkle looked perplexed , and bob sawyer and his friend laughed .
the two robbers issued forth with oliver between them .
arthur felt an awkward consciousness of having , in his exultant condition , been a little premature .
the result was , that , after a few struggles , oliver breathed , sneezed , and proceeded to advertise to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been imposed upon the parish , by setting up as loud a cry as could reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been possessed of that very useful appendage , a voice , for a much longer space of time than three minutes and a quarter .
" do you really ?
" i shook my head .
winkle , as they walked along , to the no small surprise of the few stragglers they met .
when i offered to your sister to keep company , and to be asked in church at such times as she was willing and ready to come to the forge , i said to her , and bring the poor little child .
as she was silently trembling , he put her shawl carefully about her , taking it up from the ground for that purpose .
so there is hope for the old ship yet .
he went to it , and found it fastened on the other side ; but she had dropped a veil in going through , and shut it in the door .
" when did he come from london ?
he , self-important , unbending , formal , austere .
i see myself , with agnes at my side , journeying along the road of life .
fact , said mr .
he seized it with the same rapid impatience which had characterised his speech , and hastily made his way to the other side of the screen .
the occasional rattle of applause upon the tables of the snuggery , denoted the successful termination of a morsel of harmony ; or the responsive acceptance , by the united children , of some toast or sentiment offered to them by their father .
mr venus smote the table with his hand .
it would be a poor pride and a false humility , said martin , in a low voice , to say , i do not wish that to be paid , or that i have any present hope of being able to pay it .
dont say it dont do good .
not so very uncommon , youll tell me .
the action of her fingers was like the action of knitting .
, which he begged to enclose .
how a bad name ?
knag once more , heaving a deep sigh as he restored to its parent shelf the book he had been reading .
he couldnt go mollancholy mad , and even if he did , you wouldnt be the better for it .
but perhaps his illness has only just taken a favourable turn , and its too late for him to come out , for its very damp and theres a heavy dew .
indeed , my dear , i will , replied rosa , in a tone of affectionate childishness that went straight and true to her heart ; i will be as good a friend as such a mite of a thing can be to such a noble creature as you .
" " my little woman , " urges mr .
why , said the old gentleman , pretty hot .
the proverb says that threatened men live long , he tells her , lightly .
i know i may trust you two .
all my work !
creakle loomed behind him .
the debauchery gained its height ; glasses were dashed upon the floor by hands that could not carry them to lips ; oaths were shouted out by lips which could scarcely form the words to vent them in ; drunken losers cursed and roared ; some mounted on the tables , waving bottles above their heads and bidding defiance to the rest ; some danced , some sang , some tore the cards and raved .
his interests , mr .
and yet there is a melancholy sweetness in these youthful hopes !
miss shepherd makes a face as she goes by , and laughs to her companion .
i should ha forgot it ; i should certainly ha forgot it !
one of the foremost of these very men , a sir richard willis , reported to oliver everything that passed among them , and had two hundred a year for it .
" lady dedlock , the most disagreeable part of this business interview remains , but it is business .
tell me more of your history .
its nearly eleven oclock , john .
never clapped eyes upon her !
i say , cried tom , in great excitement , he is a scoundrel and a villain !
with his head sunk down between his shoulders , and a hideous grin over-spreading his face , the dwarf stood up and stretched his short arm across the table .
nobody else can understand me , nobody else can comfort me , nobody else knows how unworthy i am , and yet can love me like a little child .
we were , in number and in character , as follows : firstto get my sister and myself out of the waythere were we two .
try to forget them .
now , my dear lucie , drawing his arm soothingly round her waist , i hear them moving in the next room , and miss pross and i , as two formal folks of business , are anxious not to lose the final opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear .
all her action was usually with her left hand because her hands were not a pair ; and left being much the whiter and plumper of the two .
as he is going to do so again , he happens to look at his coat-sleeve .
" oh , as to resting now , " said richard , " or as to doing anything very definite now , that ' s not easy .
i detest the whole thing so that that alone makes my head ache till i can ' t see out of my eyes .
i hoped , faltered mrs .
he sat , with folded hands , upon his pedestal , silently listening .
the plot was discovered ; all the chief conspirators were seized ; some were fined , some were put in prison , some were put to death .
youre a idle willin , says she , and i wish the merrikins joy of their bargain .
mrs granger has been kind enough to promise so , said mr dombey .
sir leicester is perhaps not wholly without an impression , though he has never resolved it into words , that the angel of death in the discharge of his necessary duties may observe to the shades of the aristocracy , " my lords and gentlemen , i have the honour to present to you another dedlock certified to have arrived per the family gout .
extermination .
" i said i would be careful not to do it .
he chuckled , as sinking on his knees before a strong chest screwed down to the floor , he thrust in his arm nearly up to the shoulder , and slowly drew forth this greasy volume .

it consisted of an elderly lady , two grey-haired gentlemen , two young ladies , and their brother .
it was only when the boy rushed at her , and threw his arms round her neck , that she lost her self-restraint .
chadband lays the same on jo ' s arm and considers where to station him .
" " not my flight ?
the father of the marshalsea , even humming a tune , and wearing his black velvet cap a little on one side , so much improved were his spirits , went down into the yard , and found his old pensioner standing there hat in hand just within the gate , as he had stood all this time .
even mrs wilfer relaxed under the influence of her married daughter , and seemed in a majestic manner to imply remotely that if r .
' there ain ' t , ' said sikes , fixing his eyes upon her , and muttering the words to himself ; ' there ain ' t a stauncher-hearted gal going , or i ' d have cut her throat three months ago .
will you take your hat up along with you , or leave it here ?
i dont know how that may have been , returned mrs .
nor did he speak again , except to say good night , until next day ; nor even then upon this subject , but on other topics quite foreign to the purpose .
have you nothing else to say ?
hide yourself , she pursued , if not at home , somewhere .
is that your fidelity to me ?
he had no suspicion that they ran any risk of being houseless until morning ; had no idea of the truth until long , long afterwards .
' ah , bless ' em , that i do , dear as it is , ' replied the nurse .
' demanded oliver .
was he to be told that , he wished to know again , by his own son on his own hearth , to his own face ?
i shouldnt wish to appear ill-mannered , gentlemen , said the third , who had called the dogs back , mr .
the view from my lady dedlock ' s own windows is alternately a lead-coloured view and a view in indian ink .
good fellow !
we must have humbug , we all like humbug , we couldnt get on without humbug .
if you were here alone , and hemmed in by the rising tide on the flow to fifty feet above your head , you could not be in greater danger than the danger you are now to be saved from .
his lucks got fouled under the keels of the barges .
jaggers was at his desk , but , seeing me enter , got up immediately and stood before his fire .
quaint things !
no , but do you know that really--seriously now and without any joking--i was given to understand by fanny herself , that you had made an offer to her , and that you two were going to be engaged quite solemn and regular .
was it possible that flora could have been such a chatterer in the days she referred to ?
this power , being a barbaric one , had no idea of stowing away a great national object in a circumlocution office , as strong wine is hidden from the light in a cellar until its fire and youth are gone , and the labourers who worked in the vineyard and pressed the grapes are dust .
he was alone in the world .
inquired another cabman .
by all means , said doctor blimber .
by this functionary he was referred to the doubtful page , who appeared with dishevelled hair and a very warm and glossy face , as of a page who had just got out of bed .
for example : the day after that on which i was obliged to appear against him , he made certain revelations touching a hamper in the cellar , which we believed to be full of wine , but which had nothing in it except bottles and corks .
i am wholly unacquainted with it .
crisparkle , not even a beloved and beautiful sisters tears under dastardly ill-usage ; he became less severe , in spite of himself , as his indignation rose ; could justify those horrible expressions that you used .
here arises a feature of the circumlocution office , not previously mentioned in the present record .
and in regard to the changes of human life , and the extraordinary manner in which we are perpetually conducting ourselves , all i can say is , with my friend shakespeare--man who wasnt for an age but for all time , and with whom my friend gay is no doubt acquainted--that its like the shadow of a dream .
no , said merry , shrugging her shoulders .

squeers was standing in a box by one of the coffee-room fire-places , fitted with one such table as is usually seen in coffee-rooms , and two of extraordinary shapes and dimensions made to suit the angles of the partition .
the time was at hand when the coach was to call for us .
opposite me was an elderly lady in a great fur cloak , who looked in the dark more like a haystack than a lady , she was wrapped up to such a degree .
they are here , sisters , said the elder lady in a trembling voice .
smallweed ' s only brother ; she had no relation but krook , and krook had no relation but mrs .
did you ever read about him ?
hul--lo !
pickwick , said jackson , in conclusion ; perkers people must guess what weve served these subpoenas for .
" mother , i have been an undutiful trouble to you , and i have my reward ; but of late years i have had a kind of glimmering of a purpose in me too .
but dont do it !
he got fractious and nervous , and i was obliged to let him go into the streets .
pickwick , that if he does not come back to this very house , with you , he will come back with me , for i will come and fetch him .
' ' here !
dont be agitated .
mrs clennams face had changed .
a little fainter .
true !
after holding her to his breast with a passionate cry , he took up his bundle and darted out at the door , with an arm across his eyes .
nicholas stammered out an awkward apology , and was precipitately retiring , when the young lady , turning her head a little , presented to his view the features of the lovely girl whom he had seen at the register-office on his first visit long before .
truly !
murmured the old man , raising his eyebrows , and his spectacles with them .

we went to newman street two or three times , where preparations were in progress too--a good many , i observed , for enhancing the comforts of old mr .
barkis , turning his glance slowly on me again , its as much as to say , that mans a-waitin for a answer .
wont you sip the goblet ?
i shouldn ' t be expected there , if i did ; the beadle ' s too gen-teel for me .
' oh no , no , ' returned oliver quickly ; ' but the eyes look so sorrowful ; and where i sit , they seem fixed upon me .
i cant believe that it is going to be ; and yet i cant believe but that everyone i pass in the street , must have some kind of perception , that i am to be married the day after tomorrow .

he was a long way down the sunny street , and was making expressive gestures for me to stop .
cook sails off with an air of beneficent dignity , highly exasperating to mrs pipchin , and is shortly joined below stairs by the rest of the confederation .
he had attained one of the greatest objects of his ambition .

this was no very great consolation to the child .
tom had retired , and they were alone .
hush , susan !
you are free on saturdays and sundays , you know .
it might be so , says twemlow ; but-- and perplexedly scratching his head , forgetful of the yolks of eggs , is the more discomfited by being reminded how stickey he is .
i should wish to speak to you first .
i would rather have lost , he said , a thousand pounds than lost the boy just now .
jellyby in all things .
the hand slips out of his , for the poor creature sinks down upon the earth , insensible .
that useful lady did as she was requested , and shortly afterwards the tuning of three fiddles was heard .
knots of people , impelled by a fatal attraction , lurked outside any house in which he was known to be , listening for fragments of his discourses to the inmates ; and , when he was rumoured to be coming down the stairs , often could not disperse so quickly but that he would be prematurely in among them , demanding their own arrears , and rooting them to the spot .
" as he evidently has a rooted feeling on this point , and as the depth of it is recognized in mrs .
what would the ruffian say , if we , setting at naught , like him , the decencies of social intercourse , were to raise the curtain which happily conceals _his_ private life from general ridicule , not to say from general execration ?
i wish you good day , mrs pipchin , and sincerely wish i could compliment you on the sweetness of your appearance !
i never knew much of him .
in a word , mr .
i will wager , said jasper , smilinghis lips were still so white that he was conscious of it , and bit and moistened them while speaking : i will wager that she hinted no wish to be released from ned .
tulkinghorn ; nor does he so much as glance at the affidavit in jarndyce and jarndyce , that has been given to him for his inspection (though he still holds it in his hand) , but continues to look at the lawyer with an air of troubled meditation .

i lose by that .
youll say we are a humbug .
" " me , " said the boy , " and emma , " patting the limp bonnet of the child he was nursing .

i wonder , said biler , blubbering outright , and smearing his eyes with his coat-cuff , that i havent been and drownded myself over and over again .
he knew enough of the world to know that there is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart ; so rendered and so free from any mercenary taint , he had such an exalted respect for it , that in the retributive arrangements made by his own mind--we all make such arrangements , more or less--he stationed miss pross much nearer to the lower angels than many ladies immeasurably better got up both by nature and art , who had balances at tellson ' s .
he behaved most nobly , but if anything lay heavy on his mind , it was that earl of essex , whose head he had seen roll off ; and he solemnly said that he had had no hand in bringing him to the block , and that he had shed tears for him when he died .
i have my doubts , too , founded on the acute experience acquired at this period of my life , whether a sound enjoyment of animal food can develop itself freely in any human subject who is always in torment from tight boots .
directly this sound reached his ears , mr abel started up , and hobbled to the door , and opened it ; and behold !
at the first pull of the night-bell i turned out , threw up the window , and put out my head .
asked mr dombey after a short pause , during which mr carker had been fluttering his papers , and muttering little abstracts of their contents to himself .
so cry away .
miss witherfield , said mr .
something of distrust lingered about him still ; for he would often come , even in the dark evenings , and call in a timid voice outside the door to know if she were safe within ; and being answered yes , and bade to enter , would take his station on a low stool at her feet , and sit there patiently until they came to seek , and take him home .
' he said , resuming his former position .
how many were with him ?
its embarrassing , said mr swiveller , in case of fire--even an umbrella would be something--but you did quite right , dear marchioness .
then mr .
when he came to view me--perhaps to bid--he required to see the roll of my accomplishments .
little dorrit had a misgiving that he might blame her father , if he saw them ; that he might think , why did he dine to-day , and leave this little creature to the mercy of the cold stones !
he did what he could to muster a smile , and returned , your fancy .
many and many is the circuit this pony has gone , said mr .
come , eddy ?
an awful company , mysteriously come together !
the doors of both sets of chambers stood open , so that anything said aloud in one set could be heard in the other .
sneered the jew , catching the boy by the arm .
and thus ended his first interview with madeline bray .
said blandois , with a smile .
and then ?
his cursed life is not his own !
she walked on as before , growing more familiar with me as we proceeded and talking cheerfully by the way , but she said no more about her home , beyond remarking that we were going quite a new road and asking if it were a short one .
weller , said the pretty housemaid , meeting sam at the door .
i dont believe the gentlemen will be the gentlemen they were , or anything like it--no , not for weeks to come .
one week , said ralph , turning to his companion , from today .

but merdle , as usual , oozed sluggishly and muddily about his drawing-room , saying never a word .
' so it is , ' acquiesced mr .
sopping and soaking in among the leaves that formed its pillow ; oozing down into the boggy ground , as if to cover itself from human sight ; forcing its way between and through the curling leaves , as if those senseless things rejected and forswore it and were coiled up in abhorrence ; went a dark , dark stain that dyed the whole summer night from earth to heaven .
whenever i fell into a thoughtful state , this subject was sure to present itself , and all my uneasiness was sure to be redoubled .
in the name of heaven , man , cried martin angrily , dont talk of eden in the same breath with that place .

it is creditable to keep up ones spirits here .
bob sawyer in the course of the day , in the hope of seeing or hearing something of the young ladys whereabouts .
the owner of the face has no cravat on , and has opened his tumbled shirt-collar to work with the more ease .

i had then divided my text (if i may be allowed so to call it) into three heads : firstly , sold ; secondly , in pursuance of a writ of execution ; thirdly , issued by a creditor ; with a few moral reflections on each , and winding up with , now to the first lot in a manner that was complimented when i afterwards mingled with my hearers .

he seems in high spirits and happy , she said , at length .
there is a gentleman in company whom two accomplished and delightful females regard with veneration , as the fountain of their existence .

mr inspector , hastily fortifying himself with another glass , strolled out with a noiseless foot and an unoccupied countenance .
but , their leaders followed her lady into her bedchamber , whence she was brought out betimes next morning , and put into a litter to be conveyed to london .

in the meantime , the place became dilapidated , the wind whistled through the cracked walls , the rain fell through the broken roof , the weeds choked the passage to the rotting door .
some young woman or other , replied the collector , rising ; some other friend of henrietta petowkers .
his answer was not cheering to my spirits , for it consisted of two dismal words , with whopping .

bumble , turning out of the main street of the town , directed their course towards a scattered little colony of ruinous houses , distant from it some mile and a-half , or thereabouts , and erected on a low unwholesome swamp , bordering upon the river .
said alice , with a faint smile .
its a bad job ; thats what it is .
it may have been that in all this there were mutterings of an awakened feeling in his breast , however selfishly aroused by his position of disadvantage , in comparison with what she might have made his life .

his friend appeared to hesitate ; and neither to have anticipated this proposal , nor to relish it very much .

mr boffin is a gentleman who inherited a property of which you may have heard some public mention ; the harmon property .
it will have been already gathered from the conversation of these worthies , that they were embarked in an enterprise of some magnitude , in which they addressed the public in general from the strong position of having everything to gain and nothing at all to lose ; and which , based upon this great principle , was thriving pretty comfortably .

a film comes over the eyes she raises for an instant , as though he had turned her faint .

a fine full-coloured young woman , mr clennam , with very dark hair and very dark eyes .
when there was any little hint of anything being in the wind , he got lost directly .
hallo you !
the brother and sister would return as they had come , and be expecting us , when the day closed in , at the fireside .
have you been alone , florence , since i was here last ?
but when i found that your sister , by rejecting my sons advances (i must add , in an unexpected manner) , had brought him to the point of proposing marriage , my feelings were of the profoundest anguish--acute .

in the matter of gravy he is adamant .
" that he cannot be at peace in mind , we have too much reason to know , " i proceeded .
tapley , i believe ?
he resented the girl ' s position , as if the lady had been the commonest of commoners .

cluppins was a little , brisk , busy-looking woman ; mrs .
so you kiss my hand as if i were a queen , eh ?
i have thought of you-- he hesitated what to call her .

i have invited this worthy officer , my dear , said john , to make a short excursion with me in which you shall be a sharer .
' oh , dear lady , why ar ' n ' t those who claim to be god ' s own folks as gentle and as kind to us poor wretches as you , who , having youth , and beauty , and all that they have lost , might be a little proud instead of so much humbler ?

and yet--so proud he was in his ruin , or so reminiscent of her only as something that might have been his , but was lost beyond redemption--that if he could have heard her voice in an adjoining room , he would not have gone to her .
the day was cold and wet , but she scarcely knew it .
tell me when to fire .
brownlow at home ?
well , i dont know about that .
and so natural did this sort of performance come to mr .
said mr pecksniff , shaking his forefinger facetiously .
he would sometimes ask her .
heaven suits the back to the burden .
what have you sworn , or what are you asked to swear , but that at such and such a time a boy was left with you in the name of smike ; that he was at your school for a given number of years , was lost under such and such circumstances , is now found , and has been identified by you in such and such keeping ?

among the days unrealities would be roads where the bright red vines were looped and garlanded together on trees for many miles ; woods of olives ; white villages and towns on hill-sides , lovely without , but frightful in their dirt and poverty within ; crosses by the way ; deep blue lakes with fairy islands , and clustering boats with awnings of bright colours and sails of beautiful forms ; vast piles of building mouldering to dust ; hanging-gardens where the weeds had grown so strong that their stems , like wedges driven home , had split the arch and rent the wall ; stone-terraced lanes , with the lizards running into and out of every chink ; beggars of all sorts everywhere : pitiful , picturesque , hungry , merry ; children beggars and aged beggars .
why , that depends in a great measure on the pattern , replied miss la creevy .
you have been in spain , sir ?
they were taken by water .
i had just come in one night from my dear girl ' s and was sitting in the midst of all my new clothes , looking at them all around me and thinking , when a letter from my guardian was brought to me .

profiting by these and other lessons , which were the result of the personal experience of the two actors , nicholas willingly gave them the best breakfast he could , and , when he at length got rid of them , applied himself to his task : by no means displeased to find that it was so much easier than he had at first supposed .

wheres my alice ?
the other ladies were not at all behind-hand in expressing similar sentiments ; and the children , of whom some scores had now collected , hooted and defied mr pecksniff quite savagely .
the first thing the old lady did , was to shake her head a great many times , and began to cry .
is there no mistake on your part ?
i thought it right that you should know it .
the major entered accordingly , and advancing to the sofa pressed her charming hand to his lips .
something was wanted to be written home , and sophy alone could be trusted to write before breakfast in the morning .
but he did not hint to me that when i had been better looking he had had this same proceeding in his thoughts and had refrained from it .
i must say that i had my doubts about the strict justice of this , and was not even frightened out of them by the bushel of wheat which reconciles all anomalies .

he began to whimper , just as he had done that night in the prison when she afterwards sat at his bedside till morning ; exclaimed that he was a poor ruin and a poor wretch in the midst of his wealth ; and clasped her in his arms .
heres a sink , with the water laid on , sir , and a clean jack towel behind the door .
then , from behind a distant hill , the noble sun rose up , driving the mists in phantom shapes before it , and clearing the earth of their ghostly forms till darkness came again .
--already hanging on its little peg ; the guitar-case quite at home on its heels in a corner ; and everybody tumbling over jips pagoda , which is much too big for the establishment .
the jovial party broke up next morning .
quite the contrary , my love .
to-day , too , she was cast in upon herself , and deprived of the relief of talking freely with her new friend , because the quarrel had been with helenas brother , and helena undisguisedly avoided the subject as a delicate and difficult one to herself .
it is humiliating enough to know that there are among men brutes so obscene and worthless , that they can delight in laying their miserable profanations upon the very steps of natures greatest altar .

youve got half the property , havent you ?
but i was not free from an impression that i had been walking about the two rooms in the night , a little beside myself , though knowing where i was ; and i felt confused at times--with a curious sense of fullness , as if i were becoming too large altogether .
that might not be so long as the marquis supposed .
his figure--what is commonly called rickety from his birth--presented a most ridiculous appearance , dressed in thick padded clothes , as a safeguard against being stabbed (of which he lived in continual fear) , of a grass-green colour from head to foot , with a hunting-horn dangling at his side instead of a sword , and his hat and feather sticking over one eye , or hanging on the back of his head , as he happened to toss it on .
on this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded a pint of this mixture , which was poured down my throat , for my greater comfort , while mrs .

you are not to go , if you please , kit , said the attorney in a mysterious and yet business-like way .
arthur did not see ; and said so .
i dare say you wouldnt .
repeated david .
here is the house .
mr bunsby answered no .

' what fancy have you got in your head now ?
they are , said newman .
yes , wegg .
i told you from the first , mr .
defiance of all suspicion , and unbounded faith in her brother .

on my telling him that i regretted not to see him in his own attire , he threw up his right arm , for a moment , as though he were brandishing some heavy weapon , and answered , as he let it fall again , that his race were losing many things besides their dress , and would soon be seen upon the earth no more : but he wore it at home , he added proudly .
" cried old fezziwig , skipping down from the high desk , with wonderful agility .
said oliver , as the boy ran to the gate , and thrust his thin arm between the rails to greet him .
a mere nothing !
i had to pass through that part , to get at the other .
exclaimed the girl , with most forlorn regret ; for she was always good to me !
" " i should hardly have been more surprised to have seen your friend in the city , " returns mr .
and when bella said again , do you think you could , lizzie ?
i dont know how it was ; it seldom looked well by candle-light .
a room not large enough to skate in ; nor adapted to the easy pursuit of any other occupation .

i have no right to make any further inquiry into the private affairs of a friend , however intimate a friend , said mr .
dont drop that one under your arm .
none are so anxious as those who watch and wait ; at these times , mournful fancies came flocking on her mind , in crowds .
stop , stop , stop !
i am very humble and submissive .
you are gone to try to do me some good , i know !
the carrier put my box down at the garden-gate , and left me .
i will now , my dear , take my leave .
now , god forgive me for saying so , but if this is little bethels doing , i wish little bethel was--was farther off , said kit checking himself , and knocking at the door .
why , i really dont know , rejoined that lady , whether i am justified in calling it so .
i am used to it .
peace , aristocrat !
defarge raised his head thoughtfully , as if there were something in that too .
it was a wretched life , he said , a miserable life .
george came after us .
wes our letter--this wont do .
but when mr pecksniff pondered on this subject (as , in his zealous way , he often did) , and thought with an uplifted heart of the train of circumstances which had delivered the old gentleman into his hands for the confusion of evil-doers and the triumph of a righteous nature , he always felt that mary graham was his stumbling-block .

under the auspices of the three , the bottled ale and the madeira were promptly disposed of ; and when (the horses being once more put to) they resumed their seats , with the case-bottle full of the best substitute for milk-punch that could be procured on so short a notice , the key-bugle sounded , and the red flag waved , without the slightest opposition on mr .
and postponing as he went along the congratulations of his numerous friends until a more convenient season , he soon arrived at mr pecksniffs house .
because they have virtually adopted bella , and will provide for her .

he wore knee breeches , and a kind of leggings rolled up over his silk stockings , and shoes with buckles ; he had ruffles at his wrists , a three-cornered hat on his head , and a long taper sword by his side .
gradgrind felt himself innocently placed in a very distressing predicament , when mr .
when he talked to the mayor , they said , oh , really , what a courtly man he was !
dear me , what a prophet you have proved yourself to be !
the king might possibly have made such a will ; or , having always been fond of the normans , he might have encouraged norman william to aspire to the english crown , by something that he said to him when he was staying at the english court .
) whether it was a son who would never know his father ' s story ; who might even live to weigh the possibility of his father ' s having disappeared of his own will and act .

come , fanny , come , fanny , he said , with his ragged clarionet case under his arm ; the lock , child , the lock !
as this boat came nearer , it was seen to have in it a block , a rusty sword , and an executioner in a black mask .
he stopped , looking up towards the skylight ; and a figure , childish itself , but carrying a child , and singing as it went , seemed to be there again .
i believe i can remember these two at a little distance apart , dwarfed to my sight by stooping down or kneeling on the floor , and i going unsteadily from the one to the other .
i only got my chest away by means of a friend as nobodys a match for .
there was an officer in command of the soldiers ; a stout , serviceable , profoundly calm man , with his drawn sword in his hand , smoking a cigar .
i hadnt any business with you , no more than you had with me .
why--yes--i believe so , assented mr merdle , putting the spoon aside , and clumsily hiding each of his hands in the coat-cuff of the other hand .
only think !
a coach was obtained , and oliver having been carefully laid on the seat , the old gentleman got in and sat himself on the other .
these facts considered , we have done little enough , i think .
i also carried the mysterious letter into the appearance and pursuits of the deceased ; wondering whether he dressed in blue , wore boots (he couldnt have been bald) , was a boy of brains , liked books , was good at bowling , had any skill as a boxer , even in his buoyant boyhood bathed from a bathing-machine at bognor , bangor , bournemouth , brighton , or broadstairs , like a bounding billiard ball ?
on recovering , she expressed her sorrow for the young king ' s death , and said that she knew she was unfit to govern the kingdom ; but that if she must be queen , she prayed god to direct her .
but what i ask is this .
and the coach disappeared from sight , as if the concussion of the air had blown it out of bleeding heart yard .
returned old arthur feigning to be suddenly enlightened .
have you betrayed me too !
theres no accounting for tastes ; but the ladies resolved unanimously that nicholas had an aristocratic air ; and nobody caring to dispute the position , it was established triumphantly .
if i were to relate to you the intrigues and plots that took place in the endeavour to get this divorce , you would think the history of england the most tiresome book in the world .
its not so much saying it that i object to , returned mr venus , as doing it .
let me get at him , pickwick , cried wardle , as he rushed at the ill- starred youth .
there we found , sitting by a fire , a very old man in a flannel coat : clean , cheerful , comfortable , and well cared for , but intensely deaf .
he then proceeded softly on his journey downstairs , towards the room in which the young gentlemen resumed their studies , when , passing by a door that stood ajar , a voice from within cried , is that dombey ?
hes never been heerd fur to complain .
in her sleep , however , florence could not lose an undefined impression of what had so recently passed .
pickwick was apprised that he would remain , until he had undergone the ceremony , known to the initiated as sitting for your portrait .
she helped with great readiness and alacrity to put away the tea-things and other matters that were lying about , and , the horses being by that time harnessed , mounted into the vehicle , followed by her delighted grandfather .
he liked to imagine this--more , at that moment , for the pleasure of imagining her continued remembrance of him , than for any worldly profit he might gain : but another and more sober fancy whispered to him that if he were alive then , he would be beyond the sea and forgotten ; she married , rich , proud , happy .
that you sent him up to the plaintiff s to make some offer of a compromise , i suppose , replied perker .
i never would have spoken , but for your finding out so much .
advantage was taken of this dilemma by mr venus , to pass a scrap of paper into mr boffins hand , and lay his finger on his own lip .
i am sorry to take you away , said montague .
let all sorts alone .
said pancks , softly , touching it with his blunt forefinger .

sawyer , said the little , fierce woman , trying to appear very calm , if youll have the kindness to settle that little bill of mine ill thank you , because ive got my rent to pay this afternoon , and my landlords a-waiting below now .
bella was nervous now , and would have been glad to recall her question .

but as i have experience of the ready goodwill and good help of those who have given occupation to lizzie , i think i will seek them out for myself .
saying which , the old lady , quite unconscious that she had spoken above a whisper , drew herself up , and looked carving-knives at the hard- headed delinquent .

first , with her left hand she jammed the loaf hard and fast against her bib , where it sometimes got a pin into it , and sometimes a needle , which we afterwards got into our mouths .
mr pecksniff made a bow ; a submissive , not to say a grovelling and an abject bow .
they had no right to question toms landlord , even if they could find him , which , according to toms account , it would not be easy to do .

i heard the clocks strike twelve , and was still reading , without knowing what i read , when agnes touched me .
cried the vengeance ; and embraced her .
you shall go .
except well ?
but suppose a man were here for a twelvemonth .
no , i returned ; but cannot the estella help it ?
in time , rob was despatched for a coach , the visitors keeping shop meanwhile ; and when he brought it , they got into it , leaving word for uncle sol that they would be sure to call again , on their way back .
sit down , and there will be no mighty wonder in your music-masters leaning idly against a pedestal and speaking with you , remembering all that has happened , and our shares in it .

upon my honour , returned markham , town seems to sharpen a mans appetite .
for estellas sake .
upon my word , if i thought you were falling among bad companions , i should be quite wretched , for i know how difficult you would find it to shake them off .

sure enough , before long the pony came trotting round the corner of the street , looking as obstinate as pony might , and picking his steps as if he were spying about for the cleanest places , and would by no means dirty his feet or hurry himself inconveniently .
i have no doubt that , girl- like , to enhance her own value and increase the ardour of mr .
the remainder of the party (half-a-dozen perhaps) turned , and went back at a great rate .
squeers , is all philosophy together ; thats what it is .
do me one favour .
i repeated .
the king ' s object was to seize upon the duke ' s dominions .
fully persuaded , however , that newman would not have solicited him to return unless there was some strong reason which required his presence at home , he resolved to go there , and hastened eastwards with all speed .
the blood drinker , added mr .
and off _her_ head comes !
when i had recovered my breath , and had got rid of a stifling sensation in my throat , i rose up and went on .
of spiritual profit ?
' the plan was so successful that i am told it has been imitated since , by other usurpers , in other progresses through other dominions .
said this figure , turning his head towards the door , im glad to see you .
dont leave us in the dark , said kags , taking down a candle from the chimney-piece , and lighting it , with such a trembling hand that the knocking was twice repeated before he had finished .
here and there , the inmate has visitors to see the sight ; then he points his finger , with something of the complacency of a curator or authorised exponent , to this cart and to this , and seems to tell who sat here yesterday , and who there the day before .
not that , said pancks , making , with great seriousness , an imitation of a surprised look and manner that appeared to be unintentionally grotesque .
there was no appointment between us ; but i think i went there to meet him , and i know he came there to meet me .
she had no means of judging of the effect of her concluding remarks upon her young companion ; for she interrupted herself at this point , and exclaimed : there she identically goes !
they should not be looked at .
" i am glad to hear you say so .
bardell announced to him with a solemn face that he might come in now , but that he must be very careful how he behaved towards his wife .
dear nicholas , i only tell you , that you may know what wickedness can prompt , but they accuse you of--a ring is missing , and they dare to say that-- the woman , said nicholas , haughtily , the wife of the fellow from whom these charges come , dropped--as i suppose--a worthless ring among some clothes of mine , early in the morning on which i left the house .
its devilish still .
it is an awful thing to bear .
you know you must say yes ; dont you ?
she may have thought i liked her best , but you didnt .
i am glad , for your sake , to hear it , remarked monks .
my dear sir , returned martin , as they shook hands , how is that possible !
she received nells apology for being so late with perfect good humour , and said that she should not have roused her if she had slept on until noon .
mr twemlow , i think ?
from one half .
be the proud bride of a ducal coronet , and forget me !

how is your ward ?

for cleopatra had her galley again now , and withers , no longer the-wan , stood upright in a pigeon-breasted jacket and military trousers , behind her wheel-less chair at dinner-time and butted no more .
like old iron !
benjamin allen was a coarse , stout , thick-set young man , with black hair cut rather short , and a white face cut rather long .
i had thought , much and often , of my doras shadowing out to me what might have happened , in those years that were destined not to try us ; i had considered how the things that never happen , are often as much realities to us , in their effects , as those that are accomplished .
i see it with pain , repeated bella , and it often makes me miserable .
they dont send many--what was your expression ?
the purpose that sustained me is over , sampson , and there is nothing now to hold me to life .
jarndyce , poking the fire , " i ' ll take an oath it ' s either in the east or going to be .
tupman , mildly .
on the contrary , said he , i thank you , for though we are strictly in our private and personal capacity , still it may be mentioned that there _are_ newgate cobwebs about , and it brushes them away .

his table was covered with papers , and he was hard at work in an old coat .
thank you , master copperfield !
micawber , of your friendly interest in all our affairs , i am well assured .

finish your dinner , and walk out with me .
" and it had such a good effect that i folded my hands upon my basket and quite recovered myself .

but she was not to be so easily left .
on his offering his hand to mrs gowan to lead her down the staircase , she retained little dorrits hand in hers , with a cautious pressure , and said , no , thank you .
pickwick if he would step upstairs .
gregsbury with a solemn aspect .
tom was almost at his wits end what to say between the two , and had already made a gesture as if he would call mr pecksniffs attention to the gentleman who had last addressed him , when martin saved him further trouble , by doing so himself .
no , no , my lad ; was the captains invariable reply to any solicitation of the kind , ive made that there little property over , jintly .
' sitch a rabbit pie , bill , ' exclaimed that young gentleman , disclosing to view a huge pasty ; ' sitch delicate creeturs , with sitch tender limbs , bill , that the wery bones melt in your mouth , and there ' s no occasion to pick ' em ; half a pound of seven and six-penny green , so precious strong that if you mix it with biling water , it ' ll go nigh to blow the lid of the tea-pot off ; a pound and a half of moist sugar that the niggers didn ' t work at all at , afore they got it up to sitch a pitch of goodness , --oh no !

would she have him fire off real guns , and have his hair cut , and his whiskers shaved , and his eyes turned right and left , and his trousers pipeclayed ?
but i cant consent , and i wont consent , and i never did consent , and i never will consent to be lost in you .
theres a fire in the kitchen , said mrs lupin , and very good company there .

surely , said rose , the poor childs story , faithfully repeated to these men , will be sufficient to exonerate him .
and good-bye , john , said little dorrit .
marriage licences and small probates were what we all looked for , and what paid us best ; and the competition for these ran very high indeed .
we are to be married whenever we can , and then i shall go to pa at the office and write to ma .
much influence around him , has that doctor ?
he walks constantly on the terrace during the summer months , with a youthful and jaunty air , which has rendered him the admiration of the numerous elderly ladies of single condition , who reside in the vicinity .
crummles in all the dignity of the outlaws wife , and miss bravassa in all the sweetness of miss snevelliccis confidential friend , and miss belvawney in the white silks of a page doing duty everywhere and swearing to live and die in the service of everybody , he could scarcely contain his admiration , which testified itself in great applause , and the closest possible attention to the business of the scene .
cried mrs todgers , with a show of honest indignation .
ive seen it in his face , when he was no more than a child--ay , many a time !
it seems to me that the objection that nothing wholesome or good has ever had its growth in such unnatural solitude , and that even a dog or any of the more intelligent among beasts , would pine , and mope , and rust away , beneath its influence , would be in itself a sufficient argument against this system .
theyve parted .

mr venus takes gulps of hot tea , shutting his eyes at every gulp , and opening them again in a spasmodic manner ; but does not commit himself to assent .

(for it was not the usual visiting room) and crossed by us on his way out .
the stranger was young , and the widow was flattered .
why , ill tell you , said fledgeby , very deliberately .

tender-hearted in you , miss bella ; but i mean to have it out right through with this young man , having got him into a corner .
in a gloomy corner , where , for years , had stood a silent dusty pile of merchandise , sheltering its colony of mice , and frowning , a dull and lifeless mass , upon the panelled room , save when , responding to the roll of heavy waggons in the street without , it quaked with sturdy tremblings and caused the bright eyes of its tiny citizens to grow brighter still with fear , and struck them motionless , with attentive ear and palpitating heart , until the alarm had passed away--in this dark corner , was arranged , with scrupulous care , all kates little finery for the day ; each article of dress partaking of that indescribable air of jauntiness and individuality which empty garments--whether by association , or that they become moulded , as it were , to the owners form--will take , in eyes accustomed to , or picturing , the wearers smartness .
but the door , as i have said , stood coaxingly open , and plainly said in conjunction with the chair , the portrait , the table , and the books , walk in , gentlemen , walk in !

estellas father would believe i had deserted him , would be taken , would die accusing me ; even herbert would doubt me , when he compared the letter i had left for him with the fact that i had called at miss havishams gate for only a moment ; joe and biddy would never know how sorry i had been that night , none would ever know what i had suffered , how true i had meant to be , what an agony i had passed through .
when we had had our tea , and the ashes were thrown up , and the candles snuffed , i read peggotty a chapter out of the crocodile book , in remembrance of old times--she took it out of her pocket : i dont know whether she had kept it there ever since--and then we talked about salem house , which brought me round again to steerforth , who was my great subject .

the cheeks and arms of peggotty , so hard and red in my childish days , when i wondered why the birds didnt peck her in preference to apples , are shrivelled now ; and her eyes , that used to darken their whole neighbourhood in her face , are fainter (though they glitter still) ; but her rough forefinger , which i once associated with a pocket nutmeg-grater , is just the same , and when i see my least child catching at it as it totters from my aunt to her , i think of our little parlour at home , when i could scarcely walk .

snodgrass , as usual , took a great mass of notes , which would no doubt have afforded most useful and valuable information , had not the burning eloquence of the words or the feverish influence of the wine made that gentlemans hand so extremely unsteady , as to render his writing nearly unintelligible , and his style wholly so .

ralph , in no-wise moved by what had lately passed , further than as he had already expressed himself , walked deliberately on , and turning out of the park and leaving golden square on his right , took his way through some streets at the west end of the town until he arrived in that particular one in which stood the residence of madame mantalini .

raddle paused to listen whether the repetition of the taunt had roused her better half ; and finding that it had not been successful , proceeded to descend the stairs with sobs innumerable ; when there came a loud double knock at the street door ; whereupon she burst into an hysterical fit of weeping , accompanied with dismal moans , which was prolonged until the knock had been repeated six times , when , in an uncontrollable burst of mental agony , she threw down all the umbrellas , and disappeared into the back parlour , closing the door after her with an awful crash .

mr abel being in a thoughtful frame of mind , and having quite enough to do to keep the pony going , went jogging on without looking round : little dreaming of the strange figure that was close behind him , until the marchioness , having in some degree recovered her breath , and the loss of her shoe , and the novelty of her position , uttered close into his ear , the words--i say , sir-- he turned his head quickly enough then , and stopping the pony , cried , with some trepidation , god bless me , what is this !

" it was so delicious to see the clouds about his bright face clearing , and to see him so heartily pleased , and to know , as it was impossible not to know , that the source of his pleasure was the goodness which was tortured by condemning , or mistrusting , or secretly accusing any one , that i saw the tears in ada ' s eyes , while she echoed his laugh , and felt them in my own .

she had laid aside her bonnet , and now appeared in a highly aristocratic and classical cap , meeting beneath her chin : a style of headdress so admirably adapted to her countenance , that if the late mr grimaldi had appeared in the lappets of mrs siddons , a more complete effect could not have been produced .

muttering a curse upon his tardiness , sikes pushed oliver before him ; and they entered a low dark room with a smoky fire , two or three broken chairs , a table , and a very old couch : on which , with his legs much higher than his head , a man was reposing at full length , smoking a long clay pipe .

of all this , and many variations of the same tune , the major would deliver himself with so many apoplectic symptoms , such rollings of his head , and such violent growls of ill usage and resentment , that the younger members of the club surmised he had invested money in his friend dombeys house , and lost it ; though the older soldiers and deeper dogs , who knew joe better , wouldnt hear of such a thing .

nor , how the lightest echo of their united home , directed by herself with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant than any waste , was music to her .
this happened so often , that mr swiveller by degrees began to feel strange influences creeping over him--horrible desires to annihilate this sally brass--mysterious promptings to knock her head-dress off and try how she looked without it .
nathaniel pipkin was a harmless , inoffensive , good-natured being , with a turned-up nose , and rather turned-in legs , a cast in his eye , and a halt in his gait ; and he divided his time between the church and his school , verily believing that there existed not , on the face of the earth , so clever a man as the curate , so imposing an apartment as the vestry-room , or so well-ordered a seminary as his own .
jaspers steadiness of face and figure becomes so marvellous that his breathing seems to have stopped .

the bell is a signal for visitors to retire , and so they have come to say good night ; but there is plenty of time , plenty of time .

harold was now king all over england , though it is doubtful whether the archbishop of canterbury (the greater part of the priests were saxons , and not friendly to the danes) ever consented to crown him .
oh , let him stay , let him stay !
i look upon you , sir , as a man who has placed himself beyond the pale of society , by his most audacious , disgraceful , and abominable public conduct .
pickwick uttered this adieu , the crowd raised a loud shout .
nothing , said the spinster aunt .
" sir leicester and lady dedlock , as i have already apologized for intruding on you , i cannot do better than be very brief .

the landlady , by no means satisfied with this assurance , which she considered an ingenious evasion of the question , rejoined that he had his reasons of course .
the regent then remained there , and henry went on to chester .

this plot got rid of , and sir walter raleigh safely shut up in the tower , his sowship held a great dispute with the puritans on their presenting a petition to him , and had it all his own way--not so very wonderful , as he would talk continually , and would not hear anybody else--and filled the bishops with admiration .

the lady of the caravan sat at one window in all the pride and poetry of the musical instruments , and little nell and her grandfather sat at the other in all the humility of the kettle and saucepans , while the machine jogged on and shifted the darkening prospect very slowly .
or she would be proud , if it wasnt sinful , master copperfield .
mr boffin is anxious on the subject .

he was a tall man of middle age , with two goggle eyes whereof one was a fixture , a rubicund nose , a cadaverous face , and a suit of clothes (if the term be allowable when they suited him not at all) much the worse for wear , very much too small , and placed upon such a short allowance of buttons that it was marvellous how he contrived to keep them on .
mrs dombey , he said , entering , i must beg leave to have a few words with you .
i had not seen the visitor and had not even appeared to myself to hear the conversation .

i was too late , and they was gone .
only to get back there , mark .
regarded from this point of view mr panckss puffings expressed injury and impatience , and each of his louder snorts became a demand for payment .

i should undoubtedly be offended by such proceedings at home , because there they are not the custom , and where they are not , they would be impertinencies ; but in america , the only desire of a good-natured fellow of this kind , is to treat his guests hospitably and well ; and i had no more right , and i can truly say no more disposition , to measure his conduct by our english rule and standard , than i had to quarrel with him for not being of the exact stature which would qualify him for admission into the queens grenadier guards .

sometimes a face would appear behind the dingy glass of a window , and would fade away into the gloom as if it had seen enough of life and had vanished out of it .
it happened to be an iron-grey autumnal day , with a shrewd east wind blowing--a day in keeping with the proceedings .
i should like to hear that same story , said the red-faced man with the cigar .
his constraint was so manifest , and it was so manifest , too , that it originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject , that charles darnay hesitated .
all right , replied noah , scratching his head .
the father of the marshalsea was supposed to know nothing about the matter , of course : his poor dignity could not see so low .

several people delighted , and the game chicken disgusted the midshipman was all alive .
perhaps the major had been pretty near the truth , when he had divined that morning that the great man who was too haughty formally to consult with , or confide in his prime minister , on such a matter , yet wished him to be fully possessed of it .
it would be better for yourself , and all of us , if you were mercenary , mr .
she wishes to know , by an early post , where he expects to go to , if he quarrels with his vittles ; and with what feelings he could turn up his nose at the cows-liver broth , after his good master had asked a blessing on it .
pickwick sat down on the rush-bottomed chair , and leisurely divested himself of his shoes and gaiters .
o , i am such a mite of a thing , and you are so womanly and handsome .
light of head with want of sleep and want of food (his appetite , and even his sense of taste , having forsaken him) , he had been two or three times conscious , in the night , of going astray .
if he would only have brushed up his hair or turned up his collar , it would have been bad enough ; but to know that that absurd figure was always gazing at me , and always in that demonstrative state of despondency , put such a constraint upon me that i did not like to laugh at the play , or to cry at it , or to move , or to speak .
i think , my dear clara , even you must observe it ?
walter , who had by this time recovered his breath , and lost his spirits--or such temporary spirits as his rapid journey had given him--looked at his questioner for a moment , said oh , captain cuttle !
i am so happy with him .
for their two faces were alone with the other flowers .
i asked him to come with us , and we would take care that he had some shelter for the night .
he only hinted this , and very distantly ; knowing that it pained tom pinch to have that gentleman disparaged , and thinking it would be as well to leave the new pupil to his own discoveries .
said tom , with great pleasure .
yes , rejoined carker , quickly ; but why ?
asked john baptist , who had begun , contentedly , to munch his bread .
sapsea rises , takes a key from a drawer , unlocks an iron safe let into the wall , and takes from it another key .
cried mary .
has the post come in ?
a casual observer might have supposed he did it , only to show his white teeth ; but tom smart thought that a consciousness of triumph was passing through the place where the tall mans mind would have been , if he had had any .

grimwig chuckled maliciously .
said a rather tall , thin , young man , in a green coat , emerging suddenly from the coach-yard .
you have heard of jefferson brick , i see , sir , quoth the colonel , with a smile .
quilp looked at his companion with his eyes screwed up into a comical expression of curiosity , and patiently awaited his further explanation ; upon which , however , mr swiveller appeared in no hurry to enter , as he ate a very long dinner in profound silence , finally pushed away his plate , threw himself back into his chair , folded his arms , and stared ruefully at the fire , in which some ends of cigars were smoking on their own account , and sending up a fragrant odour .
she adorned and graced it so that it became another place .
everything , my dear sir , was the little mans reply .

half a year afterwards the queen gave birth to a son , who was very ill received by the people , and not believed to be the son of the king .
my dear tom , said harthouse , let me try to be your banker .
" when i get down to bleak house , " said richard , " i shall have much to tell you , sir , and you will have much to show me .

jellyby ever entered my head .

" oh , lord !
no sound of cheerfulness or hope was heard ; no pleasant talk beguiled the tardy time ; no little group made common cause against the full depression of the scene .
it never occurred to me before , sir , returned mrs .
yes , said the old gentleman , tapping his desk emphatically , here , in this room .
throwing out his lines for the chief of the important tribe , while addressing himself to his own companions , he remarked , in a tone of voice which included all the company if they chose to be included , that it had been a long day , and that he felt for the ladies .
" the old girl relieves her feelings and testifies her interest in the conversation by giving the trooper a great poke between the shoulders with her umbrella ; this action she afterwards repeats , at intervals , in a species of affectionate lunacy , never failing , after the administration of each of these remonstrances , to resort to the whitened wall and the grey cloak again .
' ' let it rest with rose , then , ' interposed harry .
the strong-minded woman with an air of great interest in mrs spottletoes health , regretted that she was not more easily seen .

besides , though loo is a girl , shes not a common sort of girl .

jarndyce and miss summerson that you had had two former husbands--both very distinguished men .
it is an exquisite and beautiful thing in our nature , that when the heart is touched and softened by some tranquil happiness or affectionate feeling , the memory of the dead comes over it most powerfully and irresistibly .

mr pecksniff had got out the words crowed over , mr jonas !
jane , you undutiful little thing , go and lie down .
when the present set were took for you by your dear aunt , mr .
a thief in fustian is a vulgar character , scarcely to be thought of by persons of refinement ; but dress him in green velvet , with a high-crowned hat , and change the scene of his operations , from a thickly-peopled city , to a mountain road , and you shall find in him the very soul of poetry and adventure .
he is retired .
i only hope , said mrs chick , after a pause , that she may be worthy of the name too .
here , too , the brides trustee ; an oilcake-fed style of business-gentleman with mooney spectacles , and an object of much interest .
by eight we all sat down in one of its hotels , to eat and drink together for the last time .
how could my character fail to be influenced by them ?
as he pursued all these occupations at once ; and all steadily ; and all secretly ; and never slackened in his watchfulness of everything that mr jonas said and did , and left unsaid and undone ; it is not improbable that they were , secretly , essential parts of some great scheme which mr nadgett had on foot .
there was only one man in the room , and he was leaning out of window as far as he could without overbalancing himself , endeavouring , with great perseverance , to spit upon the crown of the hat of a personal friend on the parade below .
noah , whose top waistcoat-button might have been somewhere on a level with the crown of olivers head , rubbed his eyes with the inside of his wrists while this commiseration was bestowed upon him , and performed some affecting tears and sniffs .

what you call quick-lime ?
having arrived at this comfortable frame of mind (to which she had been greatly assisted by certain short interjectional remarks of the philosophical george) , mrs jarley consoled nell with many kind words , and requested as a personal favour that whenever she thought of miss monflathers , she would do nothing else but laugh at her , all the days of her life .

there were some minutes of discussion between them before they came to this conclusion , during which the staring rob paid close attention to both speakers , and inclined his ear to each by turns , as if he were appointed arbitrator of the argument .

the doctor shaded his forehead with his hand , and beat his foot nervously on the ground .
i have remembered who wept for a parting between the living and the dead .

asked the manager , following him down to the door .
remembering the snores which had proceeded from that cleft in the caravan in which the proprietress of the wax-work passed the night , nell rather thought she must have been dreaming of lying awake .

there are you and me , charley , when father was away at work and locked us out , for fear we should set ourselves afire or fall out of window , sitting on the door-sill , sitting on other door-steps , sitting on the bank of the river , wandering about to get through the time .
indeed , you have avoided me , mr carker , said walter , with the tears rising to his eyes ; so true was his compassion .
then , he was carried off to the tower , where they treated him well enough .
at the street-corner he stopped , and regarding me with a troubled countenance said that our ways were widely different and that he must take his leave .
master kidderminster , grown too maturely turfy to be received by the wildest credulity as cupid any more , had yielded to the invincible force of circumstances (and his beard) , and , in the capacity of a man who made himself generally useful , presided on this occasion over the exchequerhaving also a drum in reserve , on which to expend his leisure moments and superfluous forces .

brownlow nodded to mr .

her second son would have been provided for at chesney wold and would have been made steward in due season , but he took , when he was a schoolboy , to constructing steam-engines out of saucepans and setting birds to draw their own water with the least possible amount of labour , so assisting them with artful contrivance of hydraulic pressure that a thirsty canary had only , in a literal sense , to put his shoulder to the wheel and the job was done .

the day dragged on uncomfortably enough .

returned annie .
" i should then have related them to you , my love , over your french roll .
my love and my remorse go with you !
many and many an hour i sit thus ; but , of all those times , three times come the freshest on my mind .
crisparkle had left him at cloisterham .

and then they began to fish .
he does not know it , miss murdstone interposes awfully .
mr dombey represented in himself the wind , the shade , and the autumn of the christening .

the lawyer stands before the fire with his hand out at arm ' s length , shading his face .
i assure you there is nothing , my dear sir .
then his face became composed .
jones , and you have the flock .

the other bells were inscribed according to the names of the rooms to which their wires were conducted : as picture room , double room , clock room , and the like .
for this he had drawn a note-of-hand with great neatness , which he handed over to traddles on the spot , a discharge of his debt in full (as between man and man) , with many acknowledgements .
the shutting of the door stopped arthur from replying .
grewgious , she went up-stairs and softly tapped and tapped several times .
i thought you were forgetting , said newman .
i have only had one letter , rejoined kate , gently .
first of all , im a-going to call you boffin , for short , said wegg .
henerietty , old lady , this is the gentleman thats a going to decline and fall off the rooshan empire .

chillip absolutely could not bear it .
said miss sally .
finally , i went out into the air , with a dim perception that there was something unwonted in the conduct of the sunshine , and found that i had slumberously got to the turnpike without having taken any account of the road .
bless you , they grudge me nothing .
the moment that she touched the door on this night , florence found that it was open .
heres nelly trent , dear mrs quilp , said her husband .
he will not grieve for them himself , one day , if they have brought that lesson , florence .

one can dine--sup--what you please to call it ?
i am bound to confess that i cried ; but i hope it was with pleasure , though i am not quite sure it was with pleasure .
it is quite clear to me that whatever the business is , there is little good in it ; and it is so desirable for you to disentangle yourself from any appearance of willful connection with it , that i would counsel you to see her husband , if you can , and wash your hands of it by a plain statement of the facts .
kenwigs , see what it is ; make haste !
i had never been brought up to any profession , and at first i was at a loss what to do for myself .
as i went down stairs i distinctly heard them give a suppressed cheer .

they were so like the meaner sort of gipsies , that if i could have seen any of them in england , i should have concluded , as a matter of course , that they belonged to that wandering and restless people .
susan , who was infinitely more distraught than florence herself , repeated her errand ; and florence , pale and agitated , hurried down again , without a moments hesitation .

you were , said madame ; i had my eye upon you all the time .
in the same instant i heard responsive shouts , saw figures and a gleam of light dash in at the door , heard voices and tumult , and saw orlick emerge from a struggle of men , as if it were tumbling water , clear the table at a leap , and fly out into the night .
mr clennam , dont you take no notice of my son (if youll be so good) in case you find him cut up anyways difficult .
has father said anything particular to you to-day or yesterday , loo ?
my dear sister , would you condemn yourself to an unhappy life for this ?
you are right , repeated martin .
shes not come home !
i have made some advances out of pocket to accommodate these unpleasantnesses , but i necessarily look to being repaid , for i do not pretend to be a man of capital , and i have a father to support in the vale of taunton , besides striving to realize some little independence for three dear girls at home .
its the only choice ill give you .
my grandfather is a singular character , mark .
tell me , bella .
i told him i did , and it was because i did and meant to do so to the last , that i would not stoop to propitiate any of them .
this is plornish , sir .
in less than another minute she was on her road to the railway , under joes protection .
and she loves me .
twenty years ago , that pavement was worn with the footsteps of a mother and child , who , day by day , so surely as the morning came , presented themselves at the prison gate ; often after a night of restless misery and anxious thoughts , were they there , a full hour too soon , and then the young mother turning meekly away , would lead the child to the old bridge , and raising him in her arms to show him the glistening water , tinted with the light of the mornings sun , and stirring with all the bustling preparations for business and pleasure that the river presented at that early hour , endeavour to interest his thoughts in the objects before him .
" this , you must know , is the growlery .
oh yes , i replied .
standing before the dressing-glass was a middle-aged lady , in yellow curl-papers , busily engaged in brushing what ladies call their back-hair .
perhaps theyll think of me , and look this way .
you see i know her .
as she drew nigh to the more fashionable quarter of the town , kate marked many of this class as they passed by , hurrying like herself to their painful occupation , and saw , in their unhealthy looks and feeble gait , but too clear an evidence that her misgivings were not wholly groundless .
how often it happens with children !
i have learnt from your mother , mrs dombey , said mr dombey , with magisterial importance , what no doubt you know , namely , that brighton is recommended for her health .
waving his hand .
magnus , allow me to introduce my very particular friend , mr .
pray take a seat , vile i makes out the affidavit , sir , says the lawyer .
the same when he paused , and when he spoke , it as yet showed him always the one attentive frown , and the dark revelation before mentioned of her being nerved for the occasion .
but your temper is hasty and you are not considerate .
yes , rejoined mr .
said minnie , playfully .
may you , sir , be worthy of your a-dopted country !
--are very complacent and agreeable .
what mr pancks already knew about the dorrit family , what more he really wanted to find out , and why he should trouble his busy head about them at all , were questions that often perplexed him .
the cellar-door flew open with a booming sound , and then he heard the noise much louder , on the floors below ; then coming up the stairs ; then coming straight towards his door .
you are the mr .
theres a general indraught that way , observed the happy captain .
and now , when that nature concentrated its whole force so strongly on a partial scheme of parental interest and ambition , it seemed as if its icy current , instead of being released by this influence , and running clear and free , had thawed for but an instant to admit its burden , and then frozen with it into one unyielding block .
i always desire it , said the old man .
snagsby as if he were going to take his portrait , there is nothing remarkable about him at first sight but his ghostly manner of appearing .
nell thought that she could sometimes dispense with her own appetite very conveniently ; and thought , moreover , that there was nothing either in the ladys personal appearance or in her manner of taking tea , to lead to the conclusion that her natural relish for meat and drink had at all failed her .
that fancy past , he opened an old chest , took out some clothes as fondly as if they had been living things , and began to smooth and brush them with his hand .
the upshot of the business was , that kit , after weighing the matter in his mind and considering it carefully , promised , on behalf of his mother , that she should be ready within two hours from that time to undertake the expedition , and engaged to produce her in that place , in all respects equipped and prepared for the journey , before the specified period had expired .
a good deal .
this last note of interrogation bore reference to another change of posture on the old mans part , which brought his face towards mr pecksniff for the first time since he had turned away from him .
she promises a little fry for supper , and struggles about equally against her feelings and the onions .
love , however , is very materially assisted by a warm and active imagination : which has a long memory , and will thrive , for a considerable time , on very slight and sparing food .
refute these calumnies , said kate , and be more patient , so that you may give them no advantage .
i say , johnson , remonstrated mr .
the joyful occasion involves some further account of eden there happened to be on board the steamboat several gentlemen passengers , of the same stamp as martins new york friend mr bevan ; and in their society he was cheerful and happy .
thank you , and god bless you , in her name !
he emptied and put down the wine-glass half-way through this ancient civic toast , and took up the box .
when the first novelty of the meeting had worn off , and they began truly to feel how happy they were , the conversation became more general , and the harmony and pleasure if possible increased .
tell it again !
i dropped down upon you , then , you ill-conditioned man , (jeremiah chuckled at having forced her to adopt his phrase , ) for having been needlessly significant to arthur that morning .
well , but we know beforehand , returned the politic mr tapley , that pecksniff is a wagabond , a scoundrel , and a willain .
we are already friends , i hope .
dont mind it more than you can help , said mr .
cried the stranger , calling to the landlord .
said bailey , why not ?
walr , my boy , replied the captain , in the proverbs of solomon you will find the following words , may we never want a friend in need , nor a bottle to give him !
let me go away .
" it ' s easy , easy .
he immediately took the chief command of an army of twenty thousand men , and marched to stirling .
mrs lammle rises .
homeward he went therefore ; and his apartments (for he still retained the plural fiction) being at no great distance from the office , he was soon seated in his own bed-chamber , where , having pulled off one boot and forgotten the other , he fell into deep cogitation .
resumed the stranger , looking keenly into mr .
their appearance was not calculated to attract the importunate regards of such of london ' s destitute population , as chanced to take their way over the bridge that night in search of some cold arch or doorless hovel wherein to lay their heads ; they stood there in silence : neither speaking nor spoken to , by any one who passed .
ant it ?
" now you see , mr .
up came the french king with all his great force .
this greatly distressed mrs .
damme , screamed the dwarf , ill be a bachelor in earnest .
my apprehensions of being disparaged to the object of my engrossing affection were revived when we went into the drawing-room , by the grim and distant aspect of miss murdstone .
mr headstone-- stop !
i ' ve got enough to do , and little enough to get for it without thinking .
' nancy ' s appearance gave a new turn to the conversation ; for the boys , receiving a sly wink from the wary old jew , began to ply her with liquor : of which , however , she took very sparingly ; while fagin , assuming an unusual flow of spirits , gradually brought mr .

the people themselves were not fond of mortimer--first , because he was a royal favourite ; secondly , because he was supposed to have helped to make a peace with scotland which now took place , and in virtue of which the young king ' s sister joan , only seven years old , was promised in marriage to david , the son and heir of robert bruce , who was only five years old .

this boy , who was now fifteen , the new king placed in the tower for safety .
a letter from little dorrit dear mr clennam , i write to you from my own room at venice , thinking you will be glad to hear from me .
for years--for years--i have loved you ; hoping to win my way to fame , and then come proudly home and tell you it had been pursued only for you to share ; thinking , in my daydreams , how i would remind you , in that happy moment , of the many silent tokens i had given of a boy ' s attachment , and claim your hand , as in redemption of some old mute contract that had been sealed between us !
squeers is out , said nicholas , by no means overcome by the apparition , unexpected though it was .
now , if mr jefferson brick and you will be so good as to clear , ill come out last , and lock the door .
crisparkle continuing to observe it , found it even more perplexing than before , inasmuch as it seemed to denote (which could hardly be) some close internal calculation .
it seemed as though the prisons poverty , and shabbiness , and dirt , were growing in the sultry atmosphere .
i dont know why i dont , retorted mr wegg , approaching frenzy , but i dont at all .
besides , they are particular people where she is , and it might have rendered her situation uncomfortable if she had had a visit from a young man like john .
pursued the captain .
very glad to make your acquaintance , miss , said squeers , raising his hat an inch or two .
when it grew quite dark , he rose and returned home , and went to bed , murmuring to himself , she will come to-morrow !
yes , my dear , yes , rejoined the jew ; his eyes glistening , and every muscle in his face working , with the excitement that the inquiry had awakened .
at length the train came into london over the housetops ; and down below lay the gritty streets with their yet un-needed lamps a-glow , on a hot , light , summer night .

they have hot suppers every night , and talk it over with smoking drinks upon the board .
my lady is in that room in which she held her last conference with the murdered man , and is sitting where she sat that night , and is looking at the spot where he stood upon the hearth studying her so leisurely , when a tap comes at the door .
what is that ?
i shall not consider it at all unkind , and shall only be too delighted and happy to be honoured with your confidence .
murmured her mistress , take your hands away .
our house , repeated the other .

' the robber sat regarding her , for a few seconds , with dilated nostrils and heaving breast ; and then , grasping her by the head and throat , dragged her into the middle of the room , and looking once towards the door , placed his heavy hand upon her mouth .
and what an absurd fellow you are !
it might have been mr .
--just the slightest cough possible--not more than that .
returned the landlord .

he had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of my weakness that i wanted to know something about his strength .
these arrangements completed , he was informed of the necessary signs and tokens by which to recognise the artful dodger , and was conveyed by master bates through dark and winding ways to within a very short distance of bow street .
under this title the marchioness repaired , in tears , to the school of his selection , from which , as she soon distanced all competitors , she was removed before the lapse of many quarters to one of a higher grade .
perhaps it is .
why , as to that , you know , pinch , pursued the other , stirring the fire again , and speaking in his rapid , off-hand way ; its all very right and proper to be fond of parents when we have them , and to bear them in remembrance after theyre dead , if you have ever known anything of them .
heres old bounderby always boasting that at my age he lived upon twopence a month , or something of that sort .
i have not been accustomed to fatigue lately , and my journey has tired me exceedingly .
indeed , they were more and more brightly exhibited as the hours went on ; for i thought even then , and i have no doubt now , that the consciousness of success in his determination to please , inspired him with a new delicacy of perception , and made it , subtle as it was , more easy to him .
lord bless the boy !
agreeable !
confound these fellows !
and be sure that close to little georgiana , also under inspection by the same gingerous gentleman , sits fledgeby .
and with that , tim would utter a melodious chirrup , and cry dick ; and dick , who , for any sign of life he had previously given , might have been a wooden or stuffed representation of a blackbird indifferently executed , would come to the side of the cage in three small jumps , and , thrusting his bill between the bars , turn his sightless head towards his old master--and at that moment it would be very difficult to determine which of the two was the happier , the bird or tim linkinwater .
dear me , said mr .
why need you tell me what i have not asked ?

one person of mild and benevolent aspect even gave me a tract ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolent young man fitted up with a perfect sausage-shop of fetters , and entitled to be read in my cell .
well , mr dombey , hes had a fall from his horse , said rob , unwillingly ; and my master has to be up there , more than usual , either with him , or mrs dombey , or some of em ; and so weve come to town .
the worthy gentleman then became once more the life and soul of the society ; being again reinstated in his old post of lion , from which high station the temporary distraction of their thoughts had for a moment dispossessed him .
was it mr wrayburn that you threatened ?
i have not the least doubt of it , returned martin .
she sits , in her stately manner , holding her hand , and regardless of its roughness , puts it often to her lips .

and that she should be at home to-morrow at half-past one and that the decrees of fate were beyond recall and that she considered nothing so improbable as that he ever walked on the north-west side of grays-inn gardens at exactly four oclock in the afternoon .
towards nine o ' clock he smoothed his ruffled aspect , and , presenting as respectable and business-like an exterior as he could overlay his natural self with , issued forth to the occupation of the day .

what is the spike that intervenes , and who has set it up ?
lord , make us truly thankful , brother ned , said charles .
i reproach myself with the thought that i ever jested on the subject ; i ought to have known better .
i knew , and , father , you knew , and he knew , that i never did .
asked sir mulberry , with a laugh .
you assume a great crime to have been committed by one whom i , acquainted with the attendant circumstances , and having numerous reasons on my side , devoutly believe to be innocent of it .
polly coming out unscathed from this ordeal , mrs chick withdrew with her report to her brothers room , and as an emphatic comment on it , and corroboration of it , carried the two rosiest little toodles with her .
squeers nodded in the affirmative ; his companion took another peep at the little boy on the trunk , and , turning round again , looked as if he were quite disappointed to see him so much like other boys , and said he should hardly have thought it .
i shut the door after him , that it might cause no disturbance of the quiet that prevailed ; and when i turned back , i found mr .
lowten disappeared with a grin , and immediately returned ushering in the firm , in due form of precedence--dodson first , and fogg afterwards .
mrs gowan attributed certain views of furthering the marriage to my friend here , in conversation with me before it took place ; and i endeavoured to undeceive her .
repeated the doctor .
on your business , my dear , replied the jew , glancing uneasily at his companion , and slackening his pace as he spoke .
now , dombey , said miss blimber .
i am sure of that , floy .
crape !
the captain , looking at his visitor in great consternation , gently shouldered him into the next room , after laying this injunction upon him ; and disappearing for a few moments , forthwith returned in the blue suit .
you must be very cold and damp .
i do my best , pancks , returned clennam , uneasily .
do it without saying it , and then i may begin to believe you .
why do you write in the public streets ?
but he neither looked at his companion , nor broke the silence which prevailed between them , and which had fallen so suddenly upon himself , by addressing a word to him .
i wont say how much money it cost him , or how many years of his life he had been about it , but he brought it to perfection a dozen years ago .
you will excuse me , i know , being so much occupied .
he shall not weary for my death , chuff ; that was what he said next , pursued the old clerk , as he wiped his eyes ; that was what he said next , crying like a little child : he shall not weary for my death , chuff .
you must leave your father and me alone for two minutes , and as there are life and death in the world you must not delay .
" " no i don ' t , my dear .
what if the spot awakened thoughts of death !
then , i got up and partly dressed , and sat at the window to take a last look out , and in taking it fell asleep .
we were at the height of our enjoyment , and were all busily engaged , in our several departments , endeavouring to bring the last batch of slices to a state of perfection that should crown the feast , when i was aware of a strange presence in the room , and my eyes encountered those of the staid littimer , standing hat in hand before me .
well then !
he gives me the cold shoulder on this very matter as if he had had nothing to do with it , instead of being the first to propose it .
chillip , and of his holding her in such dread remembrance ; and both she and peggotty had a great deal to say about my poor mothers second husband , and that murdering woman of a sister , --on whom i think no pain or penalty would have induced my aunt to bestow any christian or proper name , or any other designation .

" --so exactly like the face of old days , " said richard in his cordial voice , and taking my hand with the brotherly regard which nothing ever changed , " that i can ' t make pretences with her .

muttered joe , shaking his head at me in very serious remonstrance .
tell me , dear eugene , what is it i shall do ?
i am as sure here , said bradley , with a clutch at the breast of his coarse shirt , as if it was written there ; with a blow or a stab at the sky .
i shall live here for two years .

the admired piratical ship had blown up , in the midst of a vast fleet of ships of all rates , and boats of all sizes ; and on the deep was nothing but ruin ; nothing but burning hulls , bursting magazines , great guns self-exploded tearing friends and neighbours to pieces , drowning men clinging to unseaworthy spars and going down every minute , spent swimmers , floating dead , and sharks .

it was quite dark when mr .
it was a very bad night ; to which succeeded a very bad morning .

what did you think of em , sir ?
my dear girl told me that night how richard ' s being thereafter prosperous or ruined , befriended or deserted , could only make this difference to her , that the more he needed love from one unchanging heart , the more love that unchanging heart would have to give him ; how he thought of her through his present errors , and she would think of him at all times--never of herself if she could devote herself to him , never of her own delights if she could minister to his .

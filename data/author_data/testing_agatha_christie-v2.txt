he blotted it carefully and then came back .
i was injured .
i dont really think it has reached such a pitch .
and presently he said in a light , almost bantering tone : youre very silent ?

she intended to have a private talk with that person .

todds visit , our landlady informed us that a person of the name of eliza dunn had called .
it was a still , warm day in early july .
i remember something of the same kind in my last practice up northbut that turned out to be purely personal
there are a lot of ramifications .
she was looking at me with a queer , rather eager sidelong glance .
thanks mister , i says and gives him back his matches , and he moves off quick , so quick
i really have been downright mean to you .
grange said : youre dead right .

but even that doesnt really explain anything .
redfern , that she went to pixy cove to meet you , and that she did meet you , and

he drew his large watch from his pocket and laid it on the table in front of him .
she had chosen a cocktail in preference to tea .
you love me faithfully and devotedly , i knowi can leave you in a position of trust .
he had a dual personality .
she half rose from her seat .
it might be valuable .
i do not hold your secret over your head and threaten you with it .

jack renauld did not either .
there are other legacies , but the residue goes to me .

in syria .
what was your idea exactly when you went to see the old devil ?

a younger , prettier mrs .
each of us , i honestly believe , was willing to stand aside for the other to go in and

lord mayfield sprang up .
this cool detached practical interest defeated him utterly .
do you ever speak the truth ?
miss marple got quite pink .
but the young lady was cleverer and more ambitious than her employers suspected .
i do not think i need to ask questions .
then , you see , he took hold of joyce and he said come along with me and ill show
i had my fishing-rod with me , too .
he died .
geoffrey lay very still , hardly breathing , sunk in oblivion .
her presence at this particular juncture was definitely desired by lord mayfield for a special reason .
no adequate return .
it was a matter of espionage and of scientific developments of a certain invention .
i know , yes , i know .
and i do think , archie , that you really ought to gojust to help poor miss blacklock out .

he felt strengthened in his beliefs when egg rang up after dinner and demanded permission to bring oliver along and
under her control , and rose told her all that she had suffered in her various situations .
by the way , is there still that nice young inspector at melchester that i remember ?
i think she was feeling the heat .
she picked up a flask of sunbathing oil .
what doesnt she know ?
around , could have arrived at the same time as the others .
youre grown up now , he said .
she waited attentively .
well , what would you say to the famous man in the brown suit having made the voyage with us
and drawing him aside from the others .
he was an imposing-looking elderly man of about sixty with a high domed forehead and white hair .
i suppose thats too much to hope for .
in the hall itself , a very big man was standing by the table .
he left his bride and rushed to her forthwith .
then why did you go to the three boars last night ?
did he find out something he shouldnt have known ?
he was poisoned , said adele , thats what they think , what they say .
dont go talking like that .
bridgets cold clear voice was speaking .
all this at the culminating moment of not a sparrow , that all-star , thrilling drama of pathos and beauty

her voice was dry and hard .
hester argyle drew in her breath sharply .

there was a big pile of tinned food in the larder .

mon ami , i would not put on the shoulders of the good god the burden of mens wrongdoing .
i went down to my cabin and began looking for something with which i could restrain my rebellious locks .
but they get disappointed .

he hired a room , and i hired one too .
it was just then that she caught sight of anne meredith on the opposite pavement .

what are you thinking out ?
i wrapped a silk handkerchief round my hand and unscrewed the bottle carefully .
exactly where were you in the room , colonel easterbrook , when the actual shooting business took place ?
my only wish was to make amends for something it had been outside my power to prevent .
there was what i can only describe as a curiously eerie feeling in the air .
this is colonel melrose , our chief constable , and mr .
poirot , his face still impassive , enquired : you do not like him ?
a man was pacing up and down in the rooma young man , with a handsome face and a haggard

i explained poirots departure and the fact that i proposed to accompany him to southampton .
i uttered a very solemn warning .
her eyes stared at him .
now , thank goodness , the balloons gone up !
let me know your fee and ill write you a cheque .
the quiet sympathy of his tone seemed to break down jane plenderleiths defences .
he saw cars parked against a wall .

another question was what had induced lord edgware suddenly to change his mind and agree to a divorce ?

there were no lies set down , that i swear to you .

yes , we practised a little deception there .

poirot spoke slowly and reflectively .
as soon as i told her , she exclaimed , its not that jack again , is it ?
and frankly , on the human side as well as the professional , i wanted to hear what she had
but all this subconscious stuff !

he paused and then asked abruptly : whats bantry got to say about it ?
and for the last five years hes been in the city in a stuffy office .
i meanwellsomewherei cant say where .
lady westholme says it is all nonsense and that she once had a red-headed kitchenmaid who told lies just like

i cant describe to you the menacing way that was said .
instantly my uneasiness returned .

that archie was going away to salisbury plainbut to be presented so suddenly with a fait accompli shook her .
she turned her head away , so that he should not see the sudden pain in her eyes .
he walked slowly away , staring up as he did so at the building above him .
they had been talking some ten minutes when michel fancied he heard a bell .
i know all we medicos hand these things out freely nowadays .

was i not already falling into the trap ?
at the study window , and back again in here .
i began to understand what commander howe had meant when he advised me not to let myself be caught up

i have known crimes that were artisticthey were , you understand , supreme exercises of imagination .
there was an ecstatic look on her freckled face .
he was fond of mevery fond of mebut i suppose never in that way .
if i have a boiled egg they cant tamper with that .
i drew him back with one hand .
i went there , said poirot , to see sir roderick horsefield .
goby came to a full stop , and looked attentively at the wastepaper basket .
oh , no , sir , theres master .
a look of doom .
i thought it might be something like that .

we went out of the door .

he gave us a little talk after dinner and the subject of these thefts came up .
but if you had taken the trouble to examine the facts you would have discovered at once that there had
that of colonel carter : that ralph was secretly married to flora .
on arrival at the hotel poirot rang up the nursing home and asked to speak to nick .

poirot made a quick guess .
only one girl .
you are doubtless correct , madame , said poirot with a bow .
you have access to dr gerards tent during his absence on the morning excursion .
i was afraid she might get a bit rattled .
she was setting up jars of jam .
he realized , which i did not , that simon clodes health was in a very precarious condition , and

the question is , he said , can hercule poirot possibly be wrong ?
a soft ripple of amusement .
youve got a splendid flat of your own .
they laughed and talked and called to one another .
he blew out his chest importantly , and katherine tried to look sufficiently impressed .
hardcastle whipped off the cloth and exposed them to mrs .
aloud he said : know anything about the trains back to town , bulger ?
the girl sorted them out obediently , packed them up and made out the bill .

miss greenshaw is dead .
he shot a glance at percival as he spoke .
she plumped down on it .
then lets settle a day now , shall we ?
aloud he said innocently : you were at sittaford house , you say , sir .
it isnt easy to think of her sticking a knife into anyone .

graham , it was very sudden , im afraid .
so overpowering was it that for the moment it swept even claire from his mind .
my father always told me that when i came to this country i was to look up mr .

of course they will !
i remember , rosalind or celia .
well go into that presently .
i dont know what you mean , he said lightly .
hercule poirot beat with his hand on the arm of his chair .
but im afraid for her .

they left the cabin .
at her sudden silence , however , he looked sharply across at her .
i dont think she schemed or planned .
somebody has to be , said mrs .
calgary was wrong .
is your real reaction ?
really , my dear , venetia kerr spoke with her well-bred drawl , too devastating , but i fancy well
he quietly shook his head .
he grows senile !
constable palk admitted to knowing miss marple .
she hates me and shes getting her revenge .
a faint smile appeared on lieutenant westons lips .

she arrived punctuallya tall , handsome young woman , plainly but neatly dressed , with an assured and businesslike manner
he motioned to tommy to sit down opposite to him .

she stoops down , and puts her finger on the trigger , laughing up at him .
without beating about the bush , one could only describe him one way , as a wreck of a man

it was clarissa who spoke first .

would it matter ?
no , none of that for me .
its nothing reallyat least i dont suppose sobut i thought id just like to ask esa cut her short .
poirot picked it up delicately .
just a knife .
i had come down to cornwall for a fortnight , to sketch .

he displayed no emotion of any kind .
you will excuse my asking , but did you resent your fathers remarriage , or did your brother do so

she was too healthy , he said .
i justwell , i just put one foot in front of the other and wonder about things .
you can hurl it across the room , of course , agreed sir charles .
he said musingly : you see , i loved leslie .

you said nothing .
father or your father had killed your mother .
you didnt feel that way , she observed .
he had bought nineteen pairs .
she was in a wood watching birds yesterday afternoonand the birds cant speak for her .
the point is , did angell really see me , or is he pretending he did ?
his voice was pleasant and he smiled , but tuppence wondered for a brief moment whether he was really what
lucia moved to the chair and sat , as poirot turned to hastings .
she and aunt lily used to have rows sometimes .
i did say that i thought youd said something about going to see some friends at wimbledon .

at last she said quietly : i dont know how you knowbut yes , you are right .
you did not know her before the cruise ?
something rose in his mindwhat was it ?
poirot opened it , stood a minute scrutinizing the grass just in front of it , then closed it again
but like an idiot i never spotted it .
we had been to see a performance of macbeth .
no , i said , it is not .

she was silent .

in fact , i havent the least idea what to do next .
but i wasnt at all sure about him .
a fabulous sum worth doing murder forif anybody knew about them .
she said something about being sorry for these wretched men who go round and try to get orders .
yes , found dead in her bed this morning .
very well dressed in black , that one .
i had had an inkling then that danger was about .
no , dear , not quite , said miss marple .
she was observant .
nevertheless there was enough noise to discourage conversation and encourage thought .
it was a very considerable curve indeed .

what had miss wills been looking for ?

crackenthorpe specially asked for curry .
presently i refused to discuss the matter any longer .
but , frankly , hester , if you are contemplating such a step , that window is no good .
something in his voice made harry look up sharply , but poirot was merely frowning gently to himself .

franois was waiting for me outside .
nodding to hugo , he added , good evening , mr birch .

it appeared to be her favourite one .
he is shy , i think .
its gone to brothers , to nephews , to second sons never to the eldest son .
she was fairly sure she would not be missed for some time .

that and never seeing the point of jokes .

would it not be possible ?
they would have lent you another apartment .
miss dove indicated a chair .
you may not have observed that i gave you no answer .

i think he likes me a littlenot as much as you , but a little .
every minute detail of their evidence was worked out beforehand .
was i beginning to fancy things , or did a look of alarm spring up suddenly in those pale ,
luke thought , im probably mad .
you did not expect it , then ?
she knew you were guilty .
perhaps they heard the shot ?
henry put his briefcase on the sofa .
a far away wistfulness came into her eyes .
(i want to go home .
his son followed him .
there is , of course , no compulsion and you can , if you prefer have your solicitor present .
his eyes glittered palely behind the strong glasses .
thats why i asked if shed had a breakdown .

a specialist of some kind .
but that didnt matter much .

two minutes later he was driving once more in the direction of mentone .
bouc sighed .

and so he looks at her , anxiously , when he thinks she isnt noticing .

and with quickening uneasiness he thought : bridget ?
one of the moroccan servants had stepped forward .
i believe she gave something to that poor little italian man to make him ill .

it had amused her a little that in the third shop the owlish young man had again appeared , once

on one of the outgoing footmarks stained with blood there is superimposed an ingoing one .
was there anyone else in the house ?
you were fond of her ?
im going to marry dr .
we thought about it , and thought about it .
he came up behind her , put his hand over her mouth , and forced her down into the water
how dramatic !
some time before that .
jack renauld was clearly disconcerted by the question .
what is odd ?
the only other person who could have killed louise was the real third girl , frances cary .
ah , this is curious , said poirot .

there was bitterness in that voice .

he saw no reaction in her face .
he was standing by the tent labelled madame esmeralda will tell your fortune for _num_ / _num_ .

easterbrook , to give all my secrets away .
but perhaps it is not seasickness , but high diplomacy .
somebody gave me that too , said miss nunn .

cold shivers ran down edwards spine .

harold was smoking a pipe and feeling that the world was a pretty good place .
somewhere , not very far away , a twig snapped with a sharp cracking noise .
what did you do in the matter , dr lloyd ?
the day wore on and tuppence became more and more baffled .
but , m .
at the worlds end .
over the phone .
i was surprisedand , as i say , interested .
dear , it will be all right .
an idea flashed across her brain .
you must forgive me speaking to you , but in this little community of ours the smallest detail is known
how do you know you did ?
mosgorovsky should ask for the key ?
i still thought it must be me .
they dont say .
really , of course , randall never dreamed that id outlive him .
what did i feel ?
some queer-looking men , and from the way they looked i saw that they were talking about me .
blore shrugged his shoulders and began to make his way up the steep slope to the house .
gerald stood paralysed , but the girl was quicker .
her after an absence of twenty minutes , in a breathless state and with an indescribable expression on her face
ive seen a lot of surgeons and i know what a lot of difference there is .
it matched the one over there .
she said at once : i want to see my goldfish , and started towards us and the pond .
it had been a somewhat rough landing , but it was a landing in the middle of nowhere .
something might turn up .
something in her greeting touched him .
he admitted that a purely routine enquiry could be delegated .
time enough for that when you accuse me of murdering the man .
as if i did not know him after all these years !

thencolonel bantry too ?
certainly joanna is my sister .
the inquest was then adjourned for a week by a properly docile coroner .

for neatness of any kind he had an absolute passion .
it is clothes , said lombard as they drew nearer .
if youre young and beautiful you do it like delilah .
but you see , i had had a letter , from this martine .
there were a certain number of bottles on it .
the two men rose to greet the newcomer .
subdue your melodramatic fancies , said tommy .
i do sometimes , said lord caterham , shuddering .
tuppence paled a little .
what had actually occurred was this .
oh , madame , believe me , i would not harass your feelings unnecessarily .
well , what were you thinking of ?
the inspector asked , with emphasis .
the idea met with unexpected success .
i told miss shapland to say that wed ring him back , and sent her to find you .
the postmistress hurried out with parcels , parcels connected with the shop side of her business , for the post
my friends brow puckered .

if its anything important , sir , perhaps i might go round there now in a taxi .
then he turned aside and rapped gently on the door of the little white plastered lodge .
you are grown up now .
they say to me vous allez vous empoisonner .
thats whats so inexplicable .
poirot said coolly : there remains the possibility of amyas crale having been killed by somebody else .
it could be a forgery , said taverner hopefully .
but first , id like to show you this .
if so , dont you think that i shall be able to notice it , too ?
its unfortunate .

however , i wont go into that again .

of the other occupants of the room , the iraqi clerk was dancing excitedly on his feet , the dark
fletcher felt like a man who has received an unexpected jolt .
poirot was silent .
will you let me be the judge of that ?
i meant something startling , surprising .
and he had replied vehemently : but im keen on my profession .
packets and packets of soap flakesand i never allow more than three a week .
so you do think so , said sir george , heavily .
or were her words to be taken in a religious sense ?
arent we going to make any plansfor the future ?

he turned to the two women who were just entering the hall .
rivingtons treatment of doctors as though they were library books , bobby returned to the point .
she asked jeremy and hugo .
she thought : civilization is all wrongall wrong !
no patience with her fusses and her fancies , thats what she said .
it did him some good , perhaps , but he was already a very ill man , badly crippled ,
i set the case before himof course , in the most carefully guarded language .
but if he was william bosner , then he was certainly a most accomplished actor !
how was san raphael ?
you are aware , no doubt , georges , of the death of my dentist ?
you do know that much ?
with a brave attempt to look serious and to match the solemnity of her delivery , poirot answered , yes
for a moment i thoughtwell , i will not tell you what i thought .
lady angkatell , shadowy , elusive , unexpectedly and bewilderingly charming , with that deadly power of inconsequent suggestion .
iii richard started into baghdad at early dawn and went straight to the tio hotel .
ramsay and supply a background .
and then when thisthis streak of madness appeared , it settled things definitely , i thought .
we are like little children playing cache-cache in the dark .
renisenb stood up .
she got up and drifted out again , murmuring over her shoulder : youll tell dennis , wont you ?
i cant say more .
listen , olive , and believe what i say .
it was , then , a discussion between two members of the family only .
halliday told me about three weeks beforebefore all this happened .
his eye sought mr .
was hedangerous ?
he passed through the salon of the villa , noting with appreciation the few objets dart which were carelessly scattered
he hardly had to make up at all .
as i told you in my letter , she said , i think i have fulfilled the terms of the
a woman dressed in some pale mother-of-pearl colouring .
harry ?
muriel king buried her face in her hands .
then , could it bea live bodysomeone pretending to be dead ?
it would be less intimate .
poor leo staverton broke his neck in the hunting field and hes all done up in plasterthat cant be it
in this country , said miss marple .
miss marple turned to me .
miss lawson sighed and said : it must be very hard for her sometimesliving in an outlandish place like smyrna
poirot , this is the second time ive been here this morning .
poirot leant forward with interest .
the question is , what to do ?
not the best type of american , eitherthe kind that knows nothing about anything and just wants a curio to
if one is alone and does not happen to want to see callerswell , the only thing to do is
the second shot .
i said hesitatingly .
a manager .
they went down one .
it was just after dinner .
this is the dining room .
i am therefore satisfied that she did take the coniine .
if it was nice weather it might be fun to come down occasionally .
he came forward and shook hands .
but i congratulate you upon your plain speaking , mr .
shes hooked it ?
he was that kind of person .
susan looked amused .
then i went into the drawing room to see hawes .
yes , she thought , all will indeed be well if hori says so .
to continue : i decided , almost immediately , that the concerted theory would not hold water .
rafiel could quite possibly wish to have a joke , even on his deathbed .
sir james peel edgerton said you would be able to manage that for me .
letters ?
between serrocold and this young lawson .
i think shes rather bored here .
someone perhaps who was not known to be there .
four or five years .
that power should not be given to this or that nation .
hm , said colonel weston .
really friday he meant .
i wont have you frightening the child with this silly game , madge .
of course , if the murderer is wise he will let well alone , but murderers , inspector , are
and the window on the left wall .
she also conveyed the impressionhow i do not quite know , for her manner was almost wearily indifferentof being at
what entrances and exits are there to the house ?
quite so , said miss marple , she never knew until one afternoon here when a perfectly strange woman came
it might be , you know , that they had a hold on her .
the long strain begins to tell .
sir rowland made an exclamation of annoyance .
she went onstill in that softened tone : i know dick very well hes a proud man , and very
i dont think that young lorimer had the necessary knowledge .
perhaps he even threatened somebody else that he was going to talk to us , say something he knew about
to rest on slighter evidence .
i think that there is no doubt that miss arundell died a natural death from a disease of long standing
oh , lawrence !
but he looked at him rather curiously .
he rang for drinks .
they are arranged reasonably cheaply , and almost anyone appears to be able to manage one in the end .
youre not connected with the police in any wayyoure a genuine client .
aunt lucilla would never agree to that .
perhaps , renisenb thought , she was saying to him that this must be the place where the accident occurred
the question is , said archie , whether old yellowface will look kindly on the scheme .
they have something to tell you .
but who can one imagine doing such a dreadful thing ?
after she had gone i found it .
and pushing past me , she went stumbling down the stairs .
very bad luck on him .
great interest in economics and social reform .
dont lets forget to call at the doctors on our way home .
she moved her shoulders sinuously .
my wife , she had an aunt , who caught it in spain , she did .
i agree , said despard .
miss springer said nonsense , that they were just the ones who needed it .
therefore , misled by the dot as you were , he attempts to reach cabin _num_ at one oclock on
and anyway , i continued , what does it matter ?
a case in the country .
nurse hopkins sipped her tea .
but participating in these little affairs will lead to that youth and charm being hidden behind prison wallsand i ,
he turned a mild surprised gaze on her .
then , perhaps , if you dont mind , major , we might just drop in on our way .
my bearer , wished upon me by mrs c .
jane stood up .
the other girl wasnt a patch on babe for looks and she knew it .
dermot craddock , who had a pleasant manner , went easily into speech .
poirot said : then he must have gone out soon after me ?
i dont think she will die , said calgary .
frank carter saw two men leave morleys surgery just after twenty-five past twelve .
it didnt strike you that the date was not in his handwriting ?
one of the girls had earache and miss johnson was up attending to her .
you see , dear , said my mother , its quite simple .
but i noticed one face that i had seen before , but which i could not at the moment place
edward felt that if he heard any more about uncle henry hed go mad .
i never did take kindly to castor oil , said tommy .
think carefully , and tell me whether you noticed anything unusual in his manner .
the policeman stepped to the table on which stood a telephone .
poor gordon , absolutely infatuated no doubt , and believing everything she said .
he gave him a pair of boots , one of two duplicate pairs .
jane finn , said tommy .
the girl stopped in the doorway as though undecided .
yes , if they noticed that advertisement theyd all come sniffing round at _num_ : _num_ to see what was
that was a damned clever bit of work , poirot , said sir charles appreciatively .
in other words , it was winter underclothing .
chapter thirteen vaguely reminiscent of a large bumblebee , chief-inspector fred davy wandered around the confines of the criminal investigation
let go of himlet go of him .
josephine , taking no interest in my presence , slipped past me .
le long des lauriers roses .
the room was very small and much overcrowded .
i was very much deceived in her .
but i think its about time i did .
the tin was full of potatoes .
twenty-eight suicide the summons came by telephone at the moment when poirot was sitting down to his morning coffee and
it was a fantastic story .
i heard eight bells go .
it was with a sense of relief that gwenda accepted the invitation .
curtiss came to me with his wooden face slightly disturbed and reported that poirot had had a somewhat alarming heart
jokingly , that i hoped she had an alibi .
she walked quickly across the drawing room to the wall by the far window and then brought herself up short
come , now , we know the worst .
in a brown study when poirots voice recalled me .
she was silent for a minute , brooding .
who has been to your cottage lately ?
she put the typewritten sheets down at last .
forty-eight , forty-nine , fifty .
he beamed like a complacent hardware dealer .
she spoke with decision .
besides , she added thoughtfully , i think i ought to go and see aunt jane .
that was the way you would describe it ?
his shirt was stiff with blood .
racing model .
bantry arrived .
someone who gave it up as a bad job .
he wanted from the pockets .
really , sir , i dont know what you want me to say .
you have always been of a serious turn of mind ?
her fingers went to his pulsea pulse so feeble and fluttering that it told its own story , as did
the mystery of the small attach _num_ -case .
and get them to tell me exactly what their aunt agatha or aunt betty or old uncle james told them
no , said david , disgusted .
the same designa triangle .
but ten to one it was a chance .
it was risky , but it was the only possible chance .
roberts did the inoculation ?
with a start he came back to himself to see the stranger staring up the hill with a curious speculative
seven the house in soho whittington and his companion were walking at a good pace .
he was down here in april , wasnt he ?
my father was not to be gainsaid .
if so , somebody lost no time .
oh , were both delighted , im sure , said mrs .
clement , im going to get to the bottom of this business .
did she get her letter to you written in the end ?
and in raymond boyntons case yes ?
and it was held at lucerne ?
you want to have a little bet on something , is that it ?
they fixed on linda to be the scapegoat .
has he stuck to it with you ?
then his gaze fell on the white painted wall just in front of him and he drew in his breath
really , you know , hastings , i shouldnt be surprised if hed actually murdered her .
the truth is , i think , shes been handicapped by not having to earn her living at it .
but when they hung it over the balcony it dripped .
shes not as lovely as mrs .
calf love , that was all it had been .
now its too heavy for you to carry .
like all women of that time , you accepted completely any business advice that was given you by anyone you
he was singing .
youll marry me ?
well , on the _num_ rd audrey is coming to stay with the darlingtons at esbank .

and you did not enjoy it very much .
placing her hand over the receiver , miss lemon asked in a low voice : will you accept a personal
jeremy , i meanhowever , we shant be able to prove her connection with it .
her hand still smoothed his head .
leaving his luggage behind ?
you think i am a good judge of foreigners ?
might be awkward for her some day , i warned him .
well now , isnt that wonderful , said henry .
hes the biggest landowner in these partsand in other parts of england as well .
thank goodness they took george packham with them , said colonel pikeaway .
at _num_ : _num_ miss martindales buzzer went , and edna brent in the outer office answered it in her
why was she not included amongst the suspected persons ?
smiling at her gently : have you been talking to me , midge ?
didnt want to show where the money came from .
she and lady lee often met , and it was noticed on these occasions that the younger woman watched the
i havent the least idea , said raymond .
molly as pierrette .
where , then ?
his trainwhich was due at _num_ : _num_ , was nine minutes late .
the man seemed searching her face hungrily for something he did not find .
ive always had a good memory .
there is a point , mr .
exhaustion .
pardon me , mon ami , you were not precisely sympathique .
many others could do , sitting round a table and talking .
the associationsthey were too distressing !
melchett caught the note of real anger in it .
its absolutely vital .
lennox was not so highly strung ; he was , gerard decided , of a less nervous temperament .
as much because , after all , most men can look after themselves .
who has been allowed in ?
this is a surprise finding you here !
and everyone in the house knew of this habit ?
he laughed , rather self-consciously .
it was a lovely night , warm and soft , and the moon was rising .
rivington was going to be easy meat .
(he persisted in calling gwenda miss .
the morning coffees were just getting under way .
the professor went into his laboratory , murmuring to himself , and with a smile mrs .
she was playing detective .
he might have chucked it allgone right away .
something in her manner puzzled him .
she said she hated boats .
and still she looked steadily at tuppence .
do you mean you are going to walk , sir ?
he went outto his club , i think .
' too risky .
i wouldnt go as far as that .
i was too anxious quite so .
the one old rafiel booked .
and brenda got the eserine to put a drop in each eye , and josephine , who always asks questions
hill and on to the moor .
miss shannon was , as chief inspector kemp had stated , a blonde lovely .
he pushed the door open and entered the hall .
she would drink this and go to sleep as they told her .
they hadnt just had a row or anything , had they ?
i will assure you categorically that the accusation was entirely unfounded .
only four or five miles away and quite easily reached by the local bus , i think .
she said , staring at him : you left themto die ?
nono , i think i walked about .
yes , there was no mistake .
i suppose he thought that a heart poison would be used since it paved the way to a sudden death
however , on inquiry , i found that the journey could be accomplished by only one change at exeter and
your wife is very kind , mr .
he was always a late bird .
but thenwhen she really got ill .
doesnt have to walk with a stick or anything like that .
they are capable of complicating life unbearably .
and then she had this silly love affair with a middle-aged member of the company .
in fact he admires you very much , gipsy girl .
and anything i do hear ill pass on to you , miss .
i had other work to do .
and now , perhaps you can assist me with one or two details .
sir henry drew on his pipe .
she bustled out purposefully .
society must be protected .
what was mrs so-and-so wearing at the party ?
no , its in the hall .
lynn took a step back .
very kind of you , im sure , said lord caterham .
ii renisenb , i want to talk to you about satipy .
his eyes had an affectionate twinkle in them .
as a matter of fact , it would be too easy for you i mean the thing would be off
whenever a doctor benefits by the death of a patient somebody has something ill-natured to say .
they meant to bring us down .
possibly i do , i said cautiously .
always he stood for the same things : he was a friend of lovers , and connected with death .
she was very sweet .
in the captains cabin .
he was better-tempered already .
miss lemon nodded and drew the telephone towards her .
went to dukes theatre and saw delphiniums blue .
she was mothers and aunt beatrices maid when they were girls .
it was that kind of place !
it is among that former class that we must look for our number four .
but that was too difficult .
its all on our way .
there was dr .
she based her belief , i think , on the fact that the girl was wearing a good pair of

well , tell you the truth , i packed them in a suitcase and its still upstairs .

everyone comes to me .
not at all important .
and it is so easy , hastings , to make good soup .
excuse me , could i look at your programme ?
, ive come to finish what i began .
your affectionate friend , j .
yes , he went on .
tuppence seized the bell and jane the knocker .
after all , it couldnt do any harm .
but you knew that captain trevelyan was expecting a nephew to call upon him yesterday afternoon ?
how very odd it was that it should happen the way it did , mused gwenda .
i remembered swinging on doors in my own youth .
didnt like the names i gave the childrengood saxon namesno interest in that family tree .
he said : well , its not quite like that , sir .
whats this all about anyway , mrs fox ?
his highness own idea it was .
he was a pleasant middle-aged american of a strictly conventional type .

less risky in all probability than one shot would have been .
took out my carmy car !
and giles said that it would .
come , let us be serious , now that i have had my little piece of foolery .
there was certainly about her no suggestion of the little pig who cries wee wee .
well , we must look into it , he said .

and that puts lopez in a more sinister light still if shes only run away , were bound to pick

she dealt with the situation quickly .

hugo came through the library door , looking dogged and rather defiant .
of course i wont bother you alix broke in hastily .
he stood off a few steps to judge of his effect .
she screamed a good deal , i believe .
to see if i could find a pear which was ripe .

when she first caught sight of him he had been leaning against a tree smoking a cigarette , but as

bonjour , madame .
but i was .
i remember a young fellow called aloysius jones .

and i think , monsieur , that she is very fond of you .
but he looked thoughtful .

marshall might be anxious should not come to her husbands ears ?
as for clarissa , i know all there is to know about her .
yes , sir , but not very easily .
disasters cavern , fort of fear flecker , said andrew , with conscious erudition .
thats entirely the wrong answer , jeremy complained .
barton didnt think so .
yet you made an atom scientist one of the suspects at your murder hunt ?
i would hardly have credited it , said poirot thoughtfully , but women are very unexpected .
it was then that she asked the constable if she could speak to the inspector .
said colonel melrose .
but on those evenings when charles was dining out with friends mrs .
there was a great deal of natural antagonism at first between nan watts and me .
there can be no elimination on the ground of character or position alone .

about to return a curt negative , weston was forestalled by poirot .
nor did he .

sprot glanced at her watch .

he strolled back to the house frowning .

the pattern of this murder the other night was like that .
he strolled into the library , tearing it open .

their glimpse had been only a momentary one .
inspector raglan , he said quietly , that money was given to me by mr .

satterthwaite sat alone .
with a somewhat bewildered air .
i believe you , mademoiselle , said poirot ; you have explained many things that puzzled me .
he knocked at the end door and a voice said , come in .

it is a good moment , he said quietly .
your late secretary , madame veroneau , was really the countess rossakoff , an expert thief , and it was

more caution , more reassurance .

of the questions you were posing to yourself , i replied dryly .
she paused and then added : we are all so glad youve come .

mrs macatta was a woman of great earnestness of purpose .
then he turned abruptly away , and began pacing up and down .
i hope youll keep this to yourself , she said .
it had startled her , that anger .
he entered the room his urbane and charming self , and i felt my faith in fenellas theory dwindling .
i dont believe in these masterminds , said mcneill , shaking his head : they sound all right in a

there was no poison found in any of the wine , and the food was eaten by everybody .
where do they get it from ?
but that is the sum of activities at present ?

there is no demand for them .
you then proceeded to swim .
those were his exact words .

to this i willingly agreed .
about his being a fascist and an enemy agentyes , said tuppence coldly .
poirot hesitated a minute .
you really think then , i said , that nick buckleys life is still in danger ?
you didnt see him ?
and its no good ranting .
i eyed her closely .
george lomax came forward to welcome her with considerable empressement .

linnet murmured : perhaps .
its obvious .

i should not , myself , choose to do it with photographs of spleens , diseased or otherwise .

marilyn grinned rather sheepishly .
mostly bewilderment and helplessness , i think .

it would seem soyes .

i have often noticed that being a devoted wife saps the intellect , murmured tommy .
she stammered slightly .
he thought too she was vulnerable .
he arrived at a gate to which the nameplate crosshedges was attached .

rather a difficult position sometimes ?

ellie gave a little shudder .
, alas , encouraged .
im afraid most of what she says is just bosh .
he said , frowning : somewhere , there is something that we have missed .
there was a spaniel with her .
she greeted us with a dazzling smile .
but shes a stunner to look at , aint she ?
' the two men strolled gently along the terrace .
miss freda stanton was an extremely pretty girl of the old cornish type dark hair and eyes and rosy cheeks

joan ashby was a charming creature , blue-eyed and golden-haired , with an impish glance .
suddenly , without any warning , every light was extinguished , the door banged , and from the other side
yes , i think all is well .
there was a round of leather with lettering on it , the lettering almost worn away .
it might be , i said .
im right then ?
it sounds very odd , i know , but living that way with continual rows and makingsup was amyass and
none of them are true .
what strikes me as so curious , and has done from the first , is the subject matter of that
and thats when i thought you thought that leopold had done it ?
is there going to be any funny business ?
yet nobody here knows his name or where he lives or what his business is .
on the top of it were two plain flaps of wood that could be turned round and round .
but apparently there wasnt .
having rows stimulated her , i believe .
im sure youre quite capable of it .
one has to accept the possibility that , unlikely as it seems , there is someone at sunny ridge who

i never liked speckled laurels .

it was lucky for her , i think , that she died young before she had time to be upset

so much rectitude .
his daughter madge was very different .
something degrading about that point of view .
she had good lungs .
the professor , wiping his forehead and sipping a glass of wine , remarked : she is a personality ,
three or four miles at most , and shes running beautifully now .

it was very easy .

he was breathing hard as though he had been running , but otherwise he was unmoved .

cresswell isnt named as beneficiary .
why was the name louise familiar ?
i think he may have beenkilled .
she stood quite still , paralysed with horror and with a host of conflicting ideas rushing through her brain .
i have been to your shop .
to speak of crime in such an atmosphere , is , i feel , unpardonable , began poirot apologetically .
anyway , as she stood there , somebody jogged her elbow and the glass spilled over .
she was deadly serious .
and he had the madmans fixed idea the eldest son of a lemesurier could not inherit .
, loved red roses , the red rose of lancaster .
ive wanted to help her , but she wont let me .

i enjoyed it , but found it dull .
poirot said : is there anybody you recognize in this room ?
oh , it isnt worth sitting down .
i was thinking of something , confessed tuppence .
i expect your aunt has many photographs of you , said miss marple , turning to patrick .
we have need of you .
that was why they heated the train so terribly .
said tommy scornfully , fighting down a singularly unpleasant feeling in the pit of his stomach .
it makes it impossible , said inspector neele gloomily .
and talking of that , dyou remember that old boy we noticed at the gallant endeavour ?
or he may have been dead then .
he braced himself against the deep hostile suspicion of those eyes .

henrietta , you see , is very highly strung .
she left home in suffolknot exactly reluctantlyto help the war effort and worked in various lowly positions in a hospital

i merely obtained them for comparison .
she felt a little uncertain on her legs , but she walked slowly to the small dormer window and looked

i didnt mean it in the complaining sense .

near enough , eh ?
trust in your old poirot .
unperturbed , arden said , smiling : yes , i thought youd say that .

he dropped his bag on the floor .
i can tell you one thing .
i was quite unprepared for the effect of my question .
and he has been at chimneyshow long ?
joanna opened the door of the car and i got in .
suddenly , a marvellous idea occurred to me .
you expected me ?
herethat isnt the way to wash up .
next day i felt worse , and rosalind complained of having a coldher eyes watered and she sneezed .
what can agents do at this stage ?
you know them all so well .

he says its plumb impossible .
something must be done about it .
what did you mean on the telephone when you said that you had been expecting me to call you ?
gregs no poet , said susan .
you and henry .
davis hospitably .
and what do you do ?
that is a real achievement ; which i think must lead somewhere .
thats right , he obviously said , thats what you exist for , my dear slave .
like ivory , apes and peacocks ?
miss emily arundell , replied poirot .

in spite of his dismay , or rather behind it , inspector neele had felt a faint inward satisfaction .
and unless theres a paragraph in the evening papers , you have saved her life .
i offered to take her place and try and reach you .
experiment ?
nothing was known of him ; he kept no servants ; he had no friends ; he seldom went out

for a while this amused me , then it occurred to me that colonel race , and not myself ,
the stage was set , the shorthand writer established .
it appealed to her .
because , you see , his being killed must mean something quite different .
thought tuppence .

poirot looked thoughtfully round the room .
the waitress returned with the haricot mutton , and james closed his fingers spasmodically .

to kill her was not , in his opinion , a nice child .
he chose to take offence at her tone .
you hurt me .
he listened , frowning and pulling at his lower lip .

the coroner cleared his throat and glancing round the jury of nine local worthies , started proceedings .
oh , damn it all , one must be honest , yes !
poirot nodded as he saw by my face that i was realizing the difficulties of the situation .
oh , no , clarissa replied quickly , im quite sure he didnt .
dont pretend you dont know , said clarissa , sharply .
i believe she has passed quite a stiff exam .
the waitress repeated the order in a scornful tone , but tuppence leant forward suddenly and interrupted her .

gallivanting off , wasting her money somewhere in the shops .
the girl watched him go , sighed , shook her head , and bent down to her weeding again .
doctors are like that sometimes .
and what people there were in the crescent were busy staring at _num_ .
japp shook his head , very out of breath .
lot of old women sitting round talking scandal , grunted colonel bantry .
she seemed anxious to say something , and yet not able to get it out .
who on earth would poison marina ?
poirot raised his eyebrows expressively , then shrugged his shoulders .
true up to a point , said father .
and what i say to you is , dont make a fool of yourself ; but if you are determined
he nodded his head towards the window beside the comte , and the latter moved uneasily .

olive betterton had had a quality of rather commonplace and insignificant prettiness .
, and finally was succeeded by enormous demijohns of hypochlorous lotion .
for sheer primitive rage , commend me to a thoroughgoing humanitarian when you get him well roused .
you cant put me off like that , said mr .
and really , he says some very interesting things sometimes .
and then the general had made another fitting reply to that disclaiming any merit for that past service , and
isnt that my affair ?
if hed ever tried to make money hed have lost every penny he had .
there was nothing , you see , to go upon .

paying no attention to anybody , poirot strode at once to the study .
he could not but appreciate the soft wild beauty of massed shrubs and trees .
he noted the slightly pointed ears , the un-english mongolian type of face .
hill could not be blamed for feeling hurt and surprised .

my dear girl , he said , you can hardly see the mark .
youll get no money out of us , so you can stop coming and whining for it ?
why should i go away ?

i prised out the diamond and sold it .
our marriage .
good lord , louise , what an idea !
and to think ive been thinking and planning and fretting and going nearly crazy all these months .
so i realized at once that ellen has mistaken the meaning of the words she heard .
no sort of interest in the place .
do you know , the most exciting things have been happening .
ours , so there !
suzanne looked at me with a little smile .
signor richettis hands flew expressively up in the air .
we certainly did have a body .
as ive told you i dont really know anything about her .
it was a stiff walk .
all that was years ago !
most willingly , monsieur .
it was not they who stopped her .
i think i know which .
and so she had acquired her family .
he sent me a glance in search of sympathy .
correct , she could do about it .
it is our duty as citizens to report this discovery of ours to the police at once .

it had been in richards mind , the lawyer thought , though his friend had not actually said so ,

they had just completed a grand tour of ansteys .

and perhaps you could use up that rather hard bit of cheese in making some cheese straws .
there was something rather significant about that , now that one came to examine all the facts .
erskine was talking to giles , but she was watching gwenda and her glance was both appraising and suspicious .
nobody , however , came down the stairs and mary went up the staircase and along the corridor .
it was amazing how little anything had been damaged or spoilt , apart from the destruction by moths of carpets
and it had been the shepherdess on the day of the hold-upand the next morning it had been the other
she cried out : what information ?
gladys looked faintly resentful .
the footsteps went on down the stairs .
what damned silly things one said when one was in love !
i should think so , my dearyes , i should think so .

her voice when she spoke , was unexpectedly deep .
i hope this will be useful to you , he said , as he tore off the sheet and passed

i say to you , it is necessary .
apart from the medical evidence and evidence of identity , there was little to feed the curiosity of the spectators
poirot made a grimace .
well , inspector verrall , the time has come to talk senseand to listen to it too .
since the medical evidence has been taken fully , there will be at the church a funeral memorial service tomorrow
they believe what they are told , said miss marple .

but it is too late !
poirot looked after him for a moment or two , then once more he stared straight ahead of him ,
that is good news , said poirot .
permit me to assist you , said poirot .
he felt a need to vindicate himself .
you told us you heard your grandfather screamyou couldnt have heard that if you were in heremr .
and then suddenly the tension broke .
but doesnt this upset all your ideas ?
and he really is frightfully devoted .
continued mr .
if so , he had known her , he said , in india .
blunt did some foreign business , i believe .
he shook his head and sighed .

he went to the house with richard baker .

but sometimes yes ?
unless you hold your tongue in future , it will be the worse for youin more ways than one .

anthony said slowly .

japp went on to ask reilly details about the patients he had seen that morning .

he was absent a few minutes and then returned .
at least , thats how its done in books .

osborne ushered lejeune into the small bungalow which was the acme of neatness , though rather sparsely furnished .
do you know what the twelfth labor of hercules was ?
no taste .
yes , said mrs .
and other things .
that funny little man is hercule poirot .
he was perspiring and had a smudge of earth on his forehead .
but it makes a very useful excuse for talk , dont you think ?
it had an odd dream quality .
half an hour later and everything spoiled and having to be done again .

a very peculiar smile came over gerald martins face .

her first impression that this was one of the ugliest men she had ever seen became qualified .
we would only gamble and squander it away .
you see , its not much good asking you questions until were sure .
a very few minutes sufficed to elicit the information that there were two maldons .

yes , you see , the body was found in their house .

he spoke with the utmost certainty .
nurse hopkins said : good morning , miss carlisle .

how they would goggle .
she was very miserable till nurse lauriston came to take charge .

you know the name of thomas betterton , dont you ?
it doesnt sound like me , does it ?
wetherbys an invalid , isnt she ?

poirot smiled at him .
they wanted someone to do a few specialized shots .

he looked expectantly at his mother but without any real hope .
it made for less luxury , plainer food , clothes and all those things .
then , with what seemed sudden harshness , the telephone on my fathers desk rang .
everyone was willing and anxious to point out where he lived .
he caught the man full in the middle and he capsized backwards down the stairs .

victoria responded .
there were murgatroyd and i shouting at each other .

look here , he said , i had an appointment with miss clegg at half past six .
he appointed last night at nine oclock .
from anywhere , and heres the captain struck down in exhampton itself .
what she saw was likeable enough .
as soon as the effect of the stimulant wears off , she will relapse into semiconsciousness .

he said : dont talk like that , mr .
the woman beside him turned .
i had read it before i discovered my mistake .
george would .
voil , grumbled franoise .
when was this m .
this is not in any sense an official visit , you understand , said the chancellor .
the stair creaks so that one hears everyone who goes up and down .
we have our names on them , she explained , pointing out the adhesive tape as he handed the racquet
i dont suppose anyone like lady horbury would go killing people .
yes , i understand , said tuppence , but i collect them , you know .
i have got on .
i waited , and i gathered from what was being said that she had pretended to feel faint .
always grumbling , and crusty as they make them .
the room into which they had taken me was a kind of attic right under the roof .
breakfast is ready in the dining room , sir , he said .
when will you get me , i wonder ?
the steward put in his oar .
clarissa rose to her feet .
all very sad .
murmured : make it double strong , dearie , will you ?
asked inspector slack and then blushed .
but there is something for which i waitto be exact , a letter from across the sea .
a faint shiver passed over miss popes aristocratic form .
regular french red tape !
miss webb will be disengaged in about a quarter of an houroh , well , perhaps half an hour .
i felt a pang of pity for poirot .
there was another waythe way dreams went in the moment of waking .
but what a tiresome young man he was .
she stretched out a toe and prodded him .
twenty minutes later we set forth .
	here ?
of course pagett would insist on trying to be mysterious about the whole thing .
keep all safe till i come .
you have there , have you not , a very smart brooch with your initials ?
it is supposed , i said , to induce punctuality .
a foolbut a dear soul .
marshall paused a minute , then he said : i looked in on my way down to breakfast excuse me
then , having shaken hands with all four of them , she went out .
very few of them myselfonly the ones i know something about .
' ' yes , ' said poirot gravely , ' that is my intention .
well , there she was , seventy-five , and in that drawer , the drawer of the tallboy as i
im frightenedim frightened .
she knelt down beside us and removed the gags , but left us bound , then rising and facing us
theyd just come in from outside and greta had a scarlet wool cloak half over her shoulders .
he will be in such a state of idiotic bliss that he would probably pay the most enormous bill without
: what little capital i had had was gone in the purchase of the house .
looking the other way , you saw the river tigris and the city of mosul with its minarets .
she shook her head with a febrile impatience .
he didnt want henrietta to be detached .
furies when she would turn and lambast him (gin , of course !
one can enjoy the pursuit of truth for its own sake .
nonsense , said sir charles cheerfully .
this young man was , she thought , quite an attractive specimen .
and it is not mere curiosity .
what else did you find ?
what have you got to say about things ?
i shall get out of here .
freedom and brotherhood , and pool-all-secrets and work for the good of humanity !
they write to each other .
you do not want to cause them inconvenience ?
further details of shiromakos life followed .
she was a handsome dark-haired woman .
bringing him food .
hehe just said he thought hed look me up .
didnt say nothing .
ive been hurt so much .
his words to her that morning had rung so very true .
its this business at much benham .
you didnt tell them ?
virginia was so engrossed in the puzzle presented to her that it did not occur to her to wonder at
im capable of going to sleep in an airport any time but im also capable of hearing an announcement that
school friend .
clarissa went to jeremy and placed her hand on his arm .
though , as i have told you , much can be done by leverage .
something that happened long ago and you cant help thinking about it or wanting to know why .
it tasted much the same as it had tasted before .
superb , insolent , and almost as beautiful as ever .
well yes , shes always been rather unbalanced .
everyone will say that she has killed him .
it almost ruined his career .
he turned it in the lock , pushed the door open and they went in .
once or twice ive seen her looking at youi dont know what is going on in her mind but something
and who might they be ?
joanna laughed .
i went straight to the point .
ronny stared at him .
seventeen or eighteen i suppose .
no , sir not his manner exactly .
motor to hounslow with archie at the wheel ; then he would turn the car round , put it in
hush , said bundle .
magda opened astonished eyes .
i said : i never dreamed youd remembered her .
that is to say who may have left earlier or who may not have been found and brought up .
theyre both married too .
now please think carefully before you answer .
i was sincerely attached to my wife .
your real name is richards .
laura stared at him intently .
plenty of ice , too .
that new frock , rosemary .
it was good of you to accede to my demand , but i was upset almost distraught at the time
the original key in the lock of the despatch case .
i think that after bringing you your coffee , the woman locked the door on you as she went out
at it , gets the urge again and another young woman goes out walking and is found in a gravel
rupert and i dont quite belong here .
if one is going to tell a lie at alland i notice , by the way , that your nature
bundle held her breath .
she was , in fact , the same cora you had known years ago .
elsie shivered .
franoise answered it .
ahi remember nowand they all came out of a weenie potato .
shed obviously no feeling for the aunt and uncle with whom she lived .
she must get back from babylon before the candles went out .
butbut you are , arent you ?
he said , not that its any good his coming now .
im sure the doctor told you to take things easily at first .
well , george was so pressing over his invitation to your party tonight .
he appears to be quite a dour person , but hes really a dearalways the samealways to be relied upon
and if , as lady angkatell says , miss savernake was the first person he saw when his eyes opened
hogben had clearly said all he had to say and rung off .
the young woman was just about to show them into the same sitting room as before when miss packard came
well , thats right .
only as possibilities .
i have just heard from dr .
he had died , if craddock remembered rightly , in _num_ or _num_ .
she knows that she is in dangerbut is ignorant of where the danger lies .
crosbie , the head of the establishment .
bon dieuhow this taxi crawls !
he was asleep and his head struck the top of the car and it killed him .
is that so , madame ?
reduction of weight .
oh , no , it wasnt like that .
the girl who was playing the part of the murder victim has been killed .
she touched the divan at her side .
what sort of a young man did she run away with ?
small , resolute jaw and the lips that closed together so firmly .
weve always taken it for granted that it is , but now im not so sure .
it would be , thought sir stafford nye , very difficult to recognize anybody in this scurrying crowd .
you must look at things sensibly .
they said that before .
asked the lady doubtfully .
lorrimer was partnered with anne meredith against major despard and dr .
and just out of curiosity i picked it up and opened it .
payne .
nice place youve got here , said the large , fat , bovine-looking man , turning his head back towards
having marvellous escapes from death and which will recount to you surprising histories that never happened !
now and then she played shots from the embankment down into the grass .
' ' very good .
celia , you see , is going to marryor thinks she is going to marrymy son , desmond .
oliver , i didnt know anything about it .
and poppy said yes , she thought it would .
i expect you mean edith pagett , madam .
on the mantelpiece was a big and rather evil-looking copper coffee pot with an enormous hooked spout like a large
, and his wife , mr .
the inspector shook his head .
doesnt apply .
and from that followedwhat ?
please go on ringing them .
bobby was scrambling up the precipitous path .
at least he said it was given him by this acquaintance who had told him the story about a man
i dont remember anything being different .
he seemed quite his usual cheerful self .
as he did so , he fell into a momentary brown study .
no , said jane plenderleith thoughtfully .
no , i see he hadnt .
what could we saywhat reason could we advance for seeking information ?
i give it you as my opinion that all this pilfering of petty objects was done to attract the attention
i think probably they will solve this murder , though i dont think it will happen very quickly .
now dont be an obstinate old fool , derek .
they come in and out all the time at this hour of the day .
who runs this house ?
again it is those terrible students .
cynthia fidgeted with a little tassel for some moments , then , suddenly exclaiming : you dears !
i know now what ive been doing , said bobbyquite untruthfully .
left to himself , poirot strode up and down the room muttering under his breath .
japp chuckled .
jason rudd watched her .
chapter twenty-seven there was silence for about a minute and a half .
does that really seem to you a credible suggestion , mr .
craig groaned .
iris stared .
the whole thing seems utterly mysterious .
desiring your death .
shes madsheshe couldnt torture us like she does if she were sane .
hallo , allo , allo , he said .

but young thesiger will swing all rightand a good thing tooa more utterly depraved and callous criminal i never met
whole things been badly mismanaged , declared the general just as douglas gold reappeared followed by a waiter with the
quain , of the alibi .
and then a woman , a lady of the house , came out upon the porch from the house .
they returned to the quay by a somewhat longer and more rambling route .
strangely enough , the words they uttered were both quotations .
yesand this is what frightens meclayton did not hear it .
carl reiter shook his head .
there must be no chance of anyone entering that room .
two more neatly trussed bodies lay on the floor .
i dont think it could be anything of that kind , said mrs .
woe betide any husband who orders a bottle of weed-killer nowadays .
and the name of your yacht , mr .
quin said would start the flow of ideas , the active person would be he himself .
the evil was already here concealed within the hearts of the household .
you mean those eyedrops killed him ?
i accordingly secured a sample of that cocoa , and sent it to be analysed .
and his wife , who were her near relatives .
was there a reason for that ?
	 ' yes , it seems - odd - not natural somehow .
he had no evidence to give .
what would she be like if you met her in real life ?
it is difficult to explain to you , renisenb , but once the heart is opened to evilevil blossoms like
the first is the state of the weather yesterday .
lennox stared at him .
to wait ?
miss marple took a deep breath .
whose hand had secretly dropped to the table and traced out those three letters ?
its not a school with a long tradition behind it .
he wasnt very good at this sort of thing .
clarice , watching the baffled look on miss harmons face , said to herself exultantly , oh , well-done ,
mary said : youre quite sure you saw that notice , thomas ?
perhaps youll get the key .
saltingtons quite close to easterhead bay and saltcreek , he went on .
she says shed like to see you again for a minute .

his words were indistinct , but raynor , turning to answer him , said , yes , of course ,
doctorfor gods sake , doctor , im going crazy .
the impertinence of it !
gladys shook her head .
this place the othersor most of themdont seem to feel like you ?
but she was very excited by it ?
the sister was rather a precise party .
own , invent it ?
of course , if you feel that way , theres nothing more to be said , said mrs .
have you hit him ?
poirot was his best and most sparkling self .
i thought it was a bit hard that real life should prove so lamentably behindhand .
i like looking at peoples houses .
, she had not shown herself .
men arent much at the best of times .
poirot said slowly : i rather think he did get things out of her !
have you got ideas or knowledge ?
later you are quite ready to set us on the trail of major eustace .
the old lady sat very upright , looking out of the window of the train , her lips pursed together
i dont think im in any danger , said maude confidently .
not quite yet , said tuppence .
what have you against her ?
he had not recognized her , which was not surprising since he was not robert underhay , and she ,
i know , but i thought it was better to get it over .
i turned my head sharply .
it is always better to face the truth .
ii inspector wagstaffe was interested .
lovely set of prints on that club , he said .
i returned happily to reading mmoires dun ne , sans famille , and other innocuous french literature .
not necessarily , i said .
he said goodbye to them at the gate of sans souci and turned in .
he was a solid man , a thoughtful man , a man who could bring common sense to any assemblies
you , so young as you are , to be brought in contact with horror for the first time .
granting that mr .
savaronoff , the russian champion , was one of the players , and the other , who succumbed to heart
the total of the fishmongers account does not seem to be correct and i must check it .
five letters from family and friends in england .
we do know something about what you have termed the men in her life .
but had it been nerves ?
so you do .
a black face grinned into minea devils face , i thought it , and screamed out .
id rather have the truth , mr .
i dont seem to remember you dont know them .
there was a struggle and he screamed .
was it a mans voice or a womans ?
youre very quick , mrs .

the next few weeks would be busy getting together certain equipment and being put in touch with the somewhat complicated

ridgeway bustled out with his usual celerity .
you may say what you like , but i think elsa had a bourgeois mindshe wanted to be respectably married
but it was stated at the inquest that the children were unused to bows and arrows and in consequence shot

the hospital and the doctor and the matron .
he was not only my bird , he was the start of a new secret saga .
rhoda demanded .
they would wait until the cable was delivered and would strike hard upon it .

perhaps a mere coincidenceperhaps another small link in the chain .

we left the villa marguerite like a shamefaced pack of schoolboys .
a hundred years .
only far , far below , the sea .
the last was how it happened to go .
probability poor as regards motivegood as to means of obtaining poison .
all that must have been a long time ago .
i dont know whether we overdid it a bit .
we were bothwellshattered by it .
exclaimed caroline .
the old man was disappointed by the marriage .
easier to arrange something like that when its your own house .
so thats whats been going on , is it ?
but she was an heiress .
marshall said shortly : i am rather .
and with roger leonides the answer seems to have been always wrong .
there is plenty of time really .
did you mention this loss ?
i was perfectly all right when i went to bed last nightat least of course it wasnt really last night
its all great fun , isnt it ?
women , in my experience , if they once reach the determination to commit suicide , usually wish to reveal
well , monsieur poirot , any news ?
i dont know really whether she quite took it in .
what is it gives me the pleasure of seeing you in myhmdingy office this afternoon ?
george bartlett gaped at him .
she waited in a bus queue some three or four people behind him .
she was surrounded by a vast financial network of bankers and lawyers and the administrators of trust funds .
they paused a while on the eighth tee .
nothing burntnothing torn upthere was no fire in the room .
satterthwaite were received by mrs .
then what is wrong with her ?
leaning forward she struck poirot a sharp blow across the knuckles with a paper cutter she was holding .
as a matter of fact , i thought at first it was mrs .
i suppose that was the idea .
we live at wimbledon .
i have to agreethat can and does happennot often , of that i assure youbut yessometimes mr lazenby was fidgeting

his manner oozed diplomatic secrecy as he drew me aside in the club into a quiet corner .
isaac bodlicott was one of the local characters .
but not the truth .

miss coombe took her away from the desk and threw her back on the sofa .
there were several lives then between them and the title .
ive no doubt that eva kane was a thorough little bitch , and not an injured innocent at all .

he asked : is she a great friend of your nieces ?
i dont want to be disturbed by the stewards .

there was a slight jealous chill , tuppence fancied , in her voice .
one way was as good as another .
he said : quite so , sir henry .
its safer outside im afraid to stay in this house .
but chimneys has been ransacked and overhauled a dozen times .
that will do very well .
but now there was this sudden burst of sunlight .
but she did ask me to be godmother to one of her children .
get out now .
its much better to be interesting than handsome .
people with a grudge against her ?
easy there , now .
her voice was no longer upraised in the familiar shrewish accents .
poirot said : something has occurred ?
strode up to the front door and attacked it briskly with the knocker .
from the country .
the police are searching i began .

no , no , please come with us , he requested his colleague .
at my expense .

it was only fair to dr .

poirot gave me a little friendly tap on the shoulder .
is she somewhere about ?
that one could hardly see her eyes .
macattayes ?
well , there are things one wants to know .
so there we are , said mr .
i opened it very gently and slipped inside .
a teashop , a conversation about someone called jane fish .

how does the past tie up with the present ?
guileless gwendolen , or why girls go wrong , murmured jane .
strange , at what youre asking me to believe .
no ; i must have been in the library at the time , as far as i can make out
immediately poirot was galvanized into energy .
newspapers , said miss marple , are often so sensational in their accounts .
she was writing down a message on a pad .
he took it from her and sharpened it .
you know , an ascot frock against wandsworth prison , or a frivolous suit outside a poets house .
vague ideas of an new evening dress , perhaps gold or silver evening shoes instead of black ones , something

and what of the estate ?
a great many of the things that i had foreseen came true the next morning .

in a minute he had the pleasure of seeing his two pursuers , of whom the german was one ,

it is true that i spoke of the expediency of one person dying to save many .

ive got the facts pretty clearly , continued caroline , taking no notice of poirots remark , from james and
theretheres something sinister about himand about hermrs .
there was no question of my giving evidence , or anything like that .
yes , i wondered .
i gather that your niece came from london and has been working for the cavendish bureau for the last ten
on the two brief occasions when they had met , there had been an odd kind of constraint between them
oh , yeswe have searched the records for what we knew must exist .
and caroline crale didnt know that .
the result was that crale spent most of his time scrapping with the girl angela when he wasnt painting .
but the inspectors eyes twinkled .
when the room was wanted for the new lady coming in .
where had she known that smell beforethat heavy , sweet odour ?
in front of him ran a narrow passage , with doors opening on either side of it .
the suggestion of murder thrown out at the funeral was only the first step , of course , said poirot
excuse me , but is this yours ?
in that case it was probably theresa who had actually placed the thread in position .
loo , you say ?
his secretarys voice spoke .
insensitive sort of person .
no , i cried .
he paused , then went on : with these letters i think the dpp will say we have a case
he went on , regaining a little of his aplomb : as i said before , it wasnt me !
mary gerrard is dead .
do you agree that that is what must have happened , sir ?
we dont have so many marriages on the island .
it seemed to say .
someone , somewhere , had got to be made uneasy .
i refolded the telegram and got rid of my governmental friend .
did she say anything to you about having made a new will ?
why expose dr .
of the garments and personal belongings of the dead woman , some had been given to crockett and the others
suddenly before my eyes there arose the picture of ralph paton and mrs .
actually theyre bound now for kerbela , going of course by unfrequented routes so as to give shows in remote
attachment to old possessions .
lord , what a fool !
alarm , excitement , surprise , puzzlement .
the inspector thought for a moment .
i dont like seeing this .
ah , mom ami , there you have me .
what it comes to in the end is that everybody , perhaps , is capable of murder .
he went through the wardrobe trunk and the two costly suitcases .
, and that in the event of the case coming to trial sir malcolm had been briefed to defend mr

when next i came back from baghdad , i hear that she is dead .

slippery slope .
i got work .
i said sharply that i was not so very young .
and you are not in trouble over a daughter of yoursa daughter named norma ?
and facing this way you get all the cats at night .
poirot grasped her arm .
but you see , miss helier , this isnt a serial story .
people adjusted themselves .
the latter , i think , but theyll never be able to prove it .
i mean there you are .
i much enjoyed meeting her and her lovely and unusual daughter .
her husband introduced victoria .
it to anthony .
franklin clarke rose as she came in .
i stared and he said rather impatiently : l , l , you do not believe all that rigmarole ,
' ' oh , i thought the wrist-watch might have stopped - or something .
again his attention was arrested , held .
the nurse threw open a door and frankie passed into a small sitting room daintily furnished with cheerful chintzes and
it was virginia who broke the silence at last with a little laugh .
its a bore about the money .

after a second encore the couple returned to their table close by poirot .
what he ought to have done , what any sane man would have done , was to remain patiently where

he handed across a big white silk handkerchief a good-quality handkerchief .

he closed the front door and followed her .
it looks odd .

she came to the inn and told him a few tall stories .

ive reason to believe they think that hes walking .
in the future at all .
then he asked a question .
only roughly .
but you did , you really did , mr .
theres something of the simplicity of the truly great mind about you , tuppence .
the man went away again and returned , shaking his head .
that sort of thingdoesnt last .

a nice old-fashioned place .
as she was about to pass on , she hesitated and murmured : pardon , monsieur , but i think
the police had arrived .
but i think you will be wiser than that , he continued .
you had better not publish that .
what was hidden behind that immovable face ?
' yes , ' said japp pleasantly .
the body was found in a copse a short way along the track leading from matchings halt to woodleigh camp

burton-cox leaned forward and breathed hard .
dont take on so now .
but i dont believe , somehow , peace would have suited him .
said jimmy sharply .
your gardener , griffiths .
it annoyed him , but he promised himself to get to the bottom of it before long .
the good nurse here , she tells me that you are the brother of the kind lady at the big
that is why the fingermarks have remained undisturbed since then .
what was it the old geezer had said ?
they do , do they ?
, if he wouldnt rather have specialized ?
it is irritating to find that all i remember of paris is my bedroom in the hotel , which had
surely common prudence .
i went back up the stairs againit had given me quite a shockbut i did notice that the kitchen door

that was in it , and saw that it was good .
yes , she said , her words clear and emphatic .
' i can ' t see why everything on earth doesn ' t drop out of it the whole time
it was the first jarring note .
i was aroused from my condition of mental fog by a sharp command from poirot to fetch the doctor immediately
i murmured to poirot .
but we must be more intelligent .
i understood it was mr .
these theatrical and picture people have the most curious lapses in their intelligence .
i can assure you that i have aa reason for asking .
we might perhaps take this , too , he suggested .
which leaves us with the guests .
lawrence hesitated .

and yet she is sympathique , is it not so ?
do not worry , said poirot smoothly .
mixed it up with goldfish , they did .
nurse obrien thinks a lot of him and so does nurse hopkins .
my father said , he paused , everything depends on you .
let me see now , said miss lippincott , making rather a parade of not knowing exactly , a proceeding
has he ?
us saying what was in our minds and the fear that was on us .
two crime novels were published in _num_ : appointment with death and hercule poirots christmas .

ill tell her .
weve got it , i think .
when , however , they had both drunk two cups of strong coffee , tuppence leaned back in her chair
anyway , ill marry him now as soon as he likes .
the lords will , and i dont complain , and what i say is one can get used to anything
nothing to say that he had endeavoured to erect .
her maid ?
we also exclude killing done on the spur of the moment under the impulse of an ungovernable temper .
i have finished putting this poor lady upon the rack !

that in the five minutes clayton was alone in the sitting room , someone else came in and killed him
and id find a girl , a wonderful girl , and wed live in it together happy ever after .
and if it is these coloured students , these indians , these negressesthen they can all go , you understand
she went on reading .
of course , i never said any such thing !
for a moment poirot was dazzled coming in from the shade outside .
she knew the nature of miss arundells complaint and she was well aware that phosphorus would be an ideal substance
didnt he ever go to bed ?
i do think its absolutely idiotic she broke off .
yes , i was worried .
there was horror on her face now , and those debonair high spirits of hers were quenched utterly .
the door opened again and mildred strete came in .
sir eustace has not already told you ?
elinor stood watching her for a moment as the girls even white teeth bit into the sandwich .
that by now weve rooted under every bush there is .
after ?
permit me to ask you , monsieur is this your glove ?
show her in then .
jacob would have insisted on going to the police .
looks a bit like it , i admit .
not really too exhausting upon the ankles .
come to think of it , thats whats wrong herethey have to gape at me , and they dont like
the workers , free and united , owning the means of production , free of the warmongers , of the

perhaps she had a fortune under the floorboards .
he must know that , even if these strangers had listened to his wifes fears , they had no evidence
he caught sight of madeleine .
it was a matter concerning some south american shares which led the banker to make his appointment .
i had noticed the slight hesitation in his tone when he first answered , but his second assurance was quite
not mine , sir .
he was among the guests , he was among the helpers or he walked in through the window with malice
and the very first thing i hear is that there is a very attractive young governess in the house .
an invitation _num_ .
definitely not a nice girl , said race .
i shouldnt think it was too bad if we get going in time .
it gets divided equally between the lot of them .
its not nice to have a body in ones house .
see where the dinner had got to .
poirot , did you really expect him to come back and relinquish all idea of investigating those queer things that
it flashed across my mind that he might conceivably take drugs .
your compartment was ?
everything was quiet .
' japp said suddenly : ' but the attache-case ?
father always told me to look you up if i did come .
louis barron .
at school there had been even less reassurance than elsewhere .
shepherdess .
w-w-w-what are we going to do next ?
she was madnot quite madjust a little .
a sudden light came into joyces eyes .
satterthwaite nearly knocked his coffee cup off the table .
and yet you acquiesced eagerly in sir clauds scheme of plunging the room into darkness ?
a frayed dressing-gown cord they said it was as caused it .
anything you heard or saw ?
she had used the words at random , but she went on desperately , seeking to hold his arrested attention
the feline and gingery miss merrion left the room .
hercule poirot decided to pass the remaining two hours before lunch on the island of elephantine , immediately opposite the

it seems , too , that unwise things were said to him by kameni kameni ?

pender broke off apologetically and looked round .
she put the letters into envelopes , addressed and stamped them , and posted them on her way back to
i did not speak , and he said sharply : why dont you answer ?
walter went mad and killed her .
he asked doubtingly .
there was a paragraph in the stop press this morning .
she askedhave you worked for mr .
because this doesnt seem to make sense .
poirot hurried to the instrument .
that was very wrong of her , she said sharply .
inglethorp herself aware of that fact ?
youre keeping the occupants out of them ?
oh , i hope it wasnt like that .
youve probably heard of me from bill eversleigh .
it was halfway between a wail and a bleat .
ive had enough of the fellow hanging about .
cant say that every tall tale she told was a lie .
there was a crash of rending wood , and footsteps surged up the stairs .
oh no , im sure it was quite all right .
the way you were going about these things ?
they went on with their lunch .
suggest you come over .
but it is true that when they had met earlier in the day , solly had been racked with a

in that case , it would be perfectly possible for three people to hear mrs clapperton speak from inside her

as an audience we were almost forgotten .
he simply could not understand it .
looks south american , i always think .
for myself , i would prefer to wait somewhere peacefully for the return of mrs .
she disappeared .
you cant squeeze it into an hour and a half or two hours .
and then she heard a sound , a faint , twanging musical sound .
bogus diamond mines , inaccessible rubies , the oil concessions where no oil is .
les was said to have broken with her and taken up with some other girl , but what girl was
a housekeeper , elderly , rather blind and rather deaf , a foreign girl , an au pair girl ,
everything seemed sinister to me , the waiting room , the patients , the very carpet on the stairs !
and that too was sealed .
for you , personally ?
' but he came upon me like a cat .
i have a bluenosed automatic , said jimmy with gentle pride .
does it appeal to you ?

yes , i suppose it is really rather unfortunate when something of that kind happens in a hotel .

if there are any other questions he began .
im glad you both came here .
the body had been dragged along it .
well , i was thinking that nowadays its really still like that .

finally he took us all to the ginger cat caf , where we had a somewhat stale tea served by

it denoted irresolution on her part .

he thought not .

i have had an offer for hunterburyfrom a major somervell .

tommy reflected .

it was less like answering a bell , than a triumphant manoeuvre expressing the sentiment ive caught you this time
there was no doubt about her feelings for him .
harry said : i came homefor good !
morris , my principle is not to go about suspecting things without due cause .
i read it when i was a boy , said tommy .
i wondered suddenly where i should be when the time came for me to die .

i noticed poirots eyes had become very green .
she was staring into the water .
intriguing , isnt it ?
anything the matter with uncle timothy .
when he had finished there was a pause .
i heard her , yes .
the lawyer was calmer , but there was a curious gleam in his eyes .
he is capable of making any party go .
but it still seems to me unnecessary to take a bus out to a small country place like this .
monsieur , you insult me !
but the fact remains that he did come back , the inspector persisted .
a young constable looked in .
he would have meant to let her know but had entirely forgotten to do so .

charles entered with his face rather red .
three versions he had already torn up , so he told poirot .

he seemed very far away , and curiously mundane .
i was walking across the park and there she was coming towards me .

whilst he was waiting for the meal to arrive , he got out the package of manuscript and put it

miss leatheran had been kind enough to ask him to tea and had thereupon made it her business to find

his fingers pressed the switch .
the coroner , however , passed briskly to the next point , and poirot drew a deep breath of relief
but lord bless you , sir , theres any amount of gangs knocking about .
it lends itself to certain abuses but not unduly .
tuppence was silent for a minute or twothen she said : what do you want to know ?

yes , cried henry bassington-ffrench suddenly .
the unusual ring of gravity in his voice told me that he spoke the truth .
and always one must be reasonable .
her head was bent a little as though some weight of care of perplexity bowed it down .
she would have been willing to kill himhe believed that .
kaits face was the same as usual , affectionate , plain , expressionless .
yes , it is as you say .
i can leave it outside here really because it isnt a very narrow street , is it ?
nothing less would have done it !

why use that significant indeterminate rigmarole of words ?
all neat and tidy .

but are you sure ?
theres an electric fire in the library , clarissa remembered .

i entered my wagon lit compartment at calais , the journey to dover and the tiresome sea voyage disposed of
as the two men saw it that afternoon in the september sunshine .

she received me at once .
it is perfectly clear .
im sorry if theres been a misapprehension of any kind .

i think its possible that they acted quite independently of each other .
he added gloomily : if you ask me the whole things a farce .
even henrietta had something in her of the will-o-the-wisp , of the elusive fairy coldness in the angkatell blood .

i looked at him for a moment .

poirot made a gesture , and oliver manders came back into the room .

he began talking rapidly .

screamed mrs .
and gave him hell when he did get in .
then that lets him out , said the chief constable a trifle regretfully .
even in my own department there are leaks .
oliver , if youll just put them on the corner of the sofa there i can look at them this
put anything in them , they will , holiday time .
four failuresyesbut the fifth time there may be a success .
there is something that i cannot say to him .
astwell , you once killed a man in west africa .
so you thinkwhat ?
dont want to talk of anything unpleasant at this time of year , but you know , george , im
his very eyebrows blushed .
lunchtime .
i trembled .
not this time .
he held it in the palm of his hand and looked at it with a faint stirring of recognition .
three years ago now someone wrote to me , asking if i knew that the house was to be pulled
ii thought it might be one of the other ladies .
carton must have given that wireless operator his own memorandum to copy off on to a form , and he
tendencies , and all the rest of it .
he knew , too , what mr robinson stood for .
the wagon-lit conductor was standing beside the steps .
she knew and dreaded .
no , im sure she isnt .
but when they did .
up the torch .
you never do look at a ring you know really well .
but what if you had met someone on the stairs ?
does it matter whether her parents had a suicide pact or whether they died in an aeroplane accident or one
we ' d do a show together .
i didnt mean to say that .
carrie louise is not an ordinary woman .
i wouldnt have dreamed ofyes , but look here , who was it rang youa man ?
was it evil she had sensed yesterday at the old manor house ?
all the veneer of refinement and education was stripped off .
i am so bad at explaining .
it will break up before long .
she thought : in another moment hell see !
what did she know that made her say the police were stupid ?
the law , lady frances , is an uncertain animal .
at the time being unimportant .
youre really a very understanding man .
superintendent spence looked at the table in front of him .
their two boys were thereharold , who was at eton , and wilfred , who i suppose must have been
oliver said , well , thats all right .
shesshes pretty bad they say she may not recover .
i suppose he did , she murmured , passing a tongue over her dry lips .
so that was georges plan ?
the third sister is more scatty , more localized , does not seem to have known the girl as well
the evidence of the secretary _num_ .
im her executor , so i suppose its up to me .
operas and concerts , and reading , and the enormous pleasure of dropping into bed and going to sleep ,
he was , all the same , a little afraid of her .
poirot said slowly : it is difficult .
why , the swedish lady tried it before my eyes .
the cigarette box of australian fiddlebacka present from brian pearson possibly .
leonides read you the will was he himself sitting at the desk ?
hardly likely , monsieur pennington .
ivory ?
allerton looked distressed .
down to the antarctic circle before weve finished , i expect .
if youll excuse me , sir , miss flora saw him after that .
ruth kettering had recovered her composure .
yes , clarissa , sir rowland assured her .
its in your hands now .
thats it , cried tuppence .
he drove to the elms .
caught eight mackerel .
important papers ?
i want to know what really happened .
here was a man who would never rail against fate but accept it and pass on to victory .
no , no , mademoiselle , you dont appreciate the point im trying to make .
there are explosives enough in the world already .
the doctors said she must be out of london .
but her mother interrupted her .
tim grunted .
hercules , you said , and glory be to god , theres a hercules running in the three-thirty tomorrow .
takes advantage of your absence to leave his work and go outside the courtyard .
so i made my guessand i was right .
but one likes to know background .
inspector narracott ?
sayi cant see why he resorted to such a clumsy device as a string across the stairs .
serrocold now .
poor child , she blamed herself bitterly afterwards .
well , i said , strolling to the window , i doubt if youll be able to carry out this
he murmured to himself : the fourth labor of hercules .
ill keep the technical details for the inquest , he said .
lohengrin , of course .
father , he shouted .
how very unfortunate that the person i like best in this place should be a german .
nowhere where your friend went that day ?
the two other women dispensers , but they have no connection of any kind with hickory road .
sir bartholomews death must be presumed to be the outcome of the earlier death .
he himself took the other one and sipping his whisky and soda , he went on : no , i
see how , by this explanation , everything falls into its place where carolines own reactions are concerned .
oh , so you noticed that ?
what a darling she was !
a few minutes chat ensued , in the course of which poirot elicited the fact that captain black was putting
your suggestion , then , sir claud , that we should all be searched ?
in fact she said as much , remarking after a moments reflection : i have never had anything to do
did you overhear the quarrel at all ?
you , mr warrender , mr hailsham-brown and mrs hailsham-brown .
another victim , said poirot gravely , but the last .
but , for the moment , i do not propose to leave boulogne .
i thought you had come perhaps to say that she did not know what she was doing .
on wednesday instead .
i found my tongue .
and you dont say so .
it will not be pleasant for you i dont care about that .
its incredible , said tuppence , panting a little as she removed a scratched and dirty arm from the gaping
but my nikimy niki .
bland added bitterly , it wont be easy to get him back .
' ' goodnight , my boy , ' said lord mayfield .
freddie anstice had blown his brains out just before an inquiry by the stewards into the running of one of
and you received our note , bidding you to come here , at lunchtime .
i hope im not disturbing you ?
when he spoke , his voice was very quiet .
sure thing !
youve done extraordinarily well so far , but its rather too bad ofwhat do you know him as ?
t missing that i know of .
thomas had been absent from wychwood for a good part of derby day .
but this is rather a different proposition .
baker conveyed nothing at all to me .
the gipsys warning , that sort of thing .
then , on an impulse , and feeling that the sooner he began to get down to his job the
a corner of a gilt frame .
not a good man , im afraid , said her husband .
yes , i know , but things really far back .
it tasted very bitter .
you and he together are witnesses of what has occurred .
however , it may still not be too late he paused .
instead , he inquired about the chauffeur , and learned that only yesterday monsieur renauld had declared that he was
meanwhile he was continuing in full spate .
in his experience a gardener , though anxious to appear zealously at work as you approached , was usually only
i mean she wasnt feeling suicidal or anything like that .
and now he was waiting for her to fulfil that promise .
what you outline to me is a success story !
she was not at that time a very perceptive person .
five days later i got another letter .
she was worried .
how are you getting on with unravelling the murder ?
there were unfamiliar clothes hanging on pegs .
chichester could not be exempted from my list of suspects .
the crowds of redquay .
the letter seemed to me exactly the sort of letter that a girl like martine would write under the circumstances
nigel , still weeping , looked .
theyre in a restaurant .
gin and tonic , if i may .
and then he looked at mine and he told me some amazing things .
neither on the body , nor in the luggage at the hotel , was there any trace of the papers
i understood that mr .
murmured van aldin brokenly .
astley priors was a pleasant redbrick edifice , surrounded by well-wooded grounds which effectually shielded the house from observation from
i saw someone in a scarlet kimono some way down the corridor .
shed got a bit mixed up by then , i think , said mrs .
of the mysterious affair at styles , her first published novel written some fifty years earlier .
she was like a madonna carved in stone .
his brother was arrested monday .
jefferson was so taken up with wasnt worth it .
business of audrey .
because , you see , this business im going up to town aboutwell , actually it is to scotland yard
and the young ladies .
oh , dear , sighed esther .
i must have let that woman hypnotise me .
i thought you might be .
theres a schoolgirl missing from the next county , said harper ; quite close to here .
the archdeacon was not optimistic .
how dreadful !
' sir george gave a grimace .
a gem of a house .
hes a most irritating man and he wants a new organ too .
its a nice morning , said the fair girl timidly .
his life seemed so open and aboveboard .
la famille , it is a strong tie , is it not ?
but i dont think youve got as good a case as i have .
the domestic staff and the plumbing and arguing with the builders .
i expect mummy told her about me grumbling about my racquet .
she made a queer sort of grimaceas though she were trying to swallow but her throat were too dry .
i love itbut its a tumbledown old place .
just then mr .
armstrong said : and the motive ?
so here is the setting of a crime in such wildly improbable circumstances that one feels at once , this
when she had gone , lucia moved to a chair and sat down .
occasionally poirot was distressed to find that a callous younger generation had never heard of him .
but you said you wanted to be alone , i said .
i ought to have stopped her .
the young man turned a handsome , tortured face towards his companion .
you havent had any time to go and see her , i suppose ?
that was an error most grave .
but , surely , inspector neele objected , she would have told ?
what kind of a shock ?
what it means .
he was a popular man , handsome , with an engaging , carefree manner .
bertrams hotel ?
the inner pair of swing doors opened to admit a newcomer .
he may have got up first at the end of the dinner , but actually lady edgware had been the
incident which had taken place at the vicarage .
and she threw away a brightly glittering object ?
' most extraordinary story i ' ve ever heard ?
it is always gratifying to be recognised by a young lady one has only met once and for a very
the evening , and there they were , both shot through the head .
i loved him i loved him with all my heart .
you could , she supposed , hollow out the handle to make a hiding place .
youve really no idea at all , mr .
the prefect of police wants to see me at once .
to my husband .
one cant say how long all that will last .
i give them two or three months at most .
thats only a suggestion , of course .
thats right , he said , as they entered .
who did it !
aloud he said : cynthia wont be back till well after six .
poirot picked up the sugar cutter again and took it to the window .
and i was going home to it .
she committed suicide .
yes , she said , there is something missinga scarlet morocco case .
who , then , was the man janet heard talking to miss french in the sitting room ?
im being stupid .
id been going , you see , to have it out with her .
i thought , though , that she looked rather worried .
by means of secret meetings she would imbue carol with the spirit of revoltyes , and raymond , too .
timothy .
madame , he said , there is such a thing as pity .
nobody got out the front way because it was being watched , but its clear now that somebody could have
be here very soon now !
lord whitfield seemed genuinely shocked .
the day was a wednesday , and on wednesday cheap tickets to london are issued .
it was not a drive through lonely country , they were on a main road .
but no ones murdered any of the girls .
he paused and then said unexpectedly : on the whole , you know , it was rather too much of
a panic-stricken rabbit .
rafiel , surprised .
but of course its useful to me in my workto see all the goings-on , you know .
i woke up from a kind of dream just outside the hotel and hurried in thinking i should be very
sometimes , you know , id feel i just had to scream and scream .
he held out a faded snapshot .
now , clarissa henry began , disapprovingly , only to be interrupted by his wife as she rose and flung
i should not have startled you .
no sign of her all day .
you see , i wouldnt know who the people were .
i mean , it is odd , isnt it ?
the inspector walked across to the sofa and looked down at angell .
im very careful what i say .
when you were examining the things in the silver table with dr .
the sort that will face any odds .
oh well , said jim vaguely , its invalid diet , i suppose .
still , they or one of them (mrs .
following the pointing finger , i saw a small cross marked in pencil opposite the name ursula bourne .
he had landed at alexandria the wraith of his former self , even his usual neatness had deserted him .
i dont like the particular form of murder weve just had .
its a hard nut to crack .
i say , he said .
anything that is in my power .
it was found among his papers this afternoon .
immediately we would rush out and hang on to the tents with all our might while all the dust-bin lids
entirely in his hands .
this matter has got to be kept dark .
you must say it , said sir henry .
i asked her something over the telephone and it put the idea for the story out of her head .
this time it was a headline .
hed be bored to death .
these flats !
people had stocked houses with furniture for them to live in , had done everything they could to make them
yes , but the irish are terribly perverse .
anthony whistled .
what a chance , meeting you today !
james resigned himself to the inevitable and ordered haricot mutton .
you also ?
thing which made gerda feel hot and uncomfortable all over .
poirot looked round him .
i know that is the simple and proper thing to do .
one believes what one wishes to believe , remarked miss cunningham , casting a professional eye on him .
letitia blacklock had assured him that there was no jewellery of value in the house .
on the river ?
possibly walter fane thinks that kelvin halliday was the original cause of her turning him down .
i wouldnt like to say she led him on exactlybut men do get rather silly about girls , dont they
hold everything .
it is a newly built addition to the school this year , said miss bulstrode .
a young french actress who specializes in playing schoolgirl parts was the agent chosen .
do you mean to say that youve had one of them ?
i welly sorry .
we are assembled here , ladies and gentlemen , to inquire into the death of emily arundell on the first
he wasnt really responsible for what he had done , and the truth was known , and everyone was sorry
, it all helps .
yes , i dobecause of janejanes adorable .
he paid no attention to the approach of the searchers .
asked me to meet her .
theres a name for that sort of thingit grows on you and you get worse .
the king , he rose to greet her , the maid hed sworn to wed .
marbury might come out .
like a dog will i nose out his murderer and when i have discovered himah !
wetherby spoke to someone entering the room , and though she had placed her hand over the receiver poirot could
, i heard the same hateful sibilant whisper i had begun to know so well , no smoke without fire
this , i may say , seemed a little curious to us , but we felt that it was kindly
young man who came with you ?
presently his eyes strayed to the table by the bed on which sat , rather pertly , a small furry
grainger seems definitely to negative the arsenic theory .
she understands that .
hercule poirot lay awake staring at the ceiling .
and he came out here and shot himself with it ?
beans on toast .
said lemoine gently .
it is no doubt still in the post .
moreover , since the room in which she was confined was on an upper floor , it meant either fashioning
as i was saying , if she , as the holder of one of the twin diamonds , has received
poirot rubbed his nose .
well , that was the first , then about three weeks later another .
i am worried .
his task of attaching a knotted rope so that it hung down to the rivers edge .
, but it was possible that , as nurse craven suggested , mrs .
egg pinched his arm gently .
but not very easy to obtain , eh ?
write to him .
terrible business , this , said the young man chattily .
will you have to tell anyone about this ?
it got passed on to me while their particular bright young man tried to get some news out of me
solemnity .
porter very quietly shook his head .
in that case it was possible that here was the witness in a milliona man who observed accurately and in
he said quickly : theres a wasp crawling up your arm .
iii about nine-thirty that night , rowley pushed aside a heap of forms that had been littering the kitchen table
yes , said poirot , you wont sleep .
poirot said , quietly : that is what i believe .
casson and the medium , he sought a private interview with his hostess .
i dont think its very likely , mr .
out of his ashen face , two tortured , agonized eyes gazed dumbly at hercule poirot .
did thaterknock the greenhouse down ?
i cant say that at the moment ive any idea at all .
there was a mirror in her hand .
we used to play with dr .
grown-ups can do what they like .
desmond , buti know im being unkind .
he soon reappeared .
and even my knittingsuch a comfort that has always been , and i really am a good knitter .
when did he give up his practice ?
twenty-two the truth when the inspector turned on edmund swettenham , mitzi had crept quietly out of the room and
very shortly i shall be in england , and i hope then to have the pleasure of meeting you once
he turned to close the door behind him , and in doing so he created an atmosphere of privacy .
henet bridled .
boyd carrington .
yesdr .
poirot noted the address in his notebook just below that of the doctor .
i was speaking the truth when i said we should be glad to have you .
youve got something to go on .
if it had been my business to give the certificate , id have given it without a second thought .
the lawyer clicked his thumb irritably .
hows the asthma ?
the following is the extract .
so you see , he said , i do big business .
he was aware suddenly of the old butler hovering uneasily near him .
him the sum of one hundred thousand pounds in cash if the divorce went through undefended .
one could even hear the little mouse run , if there had been one .
melrose , im sure youve heard me speak many times of mr .
llewellyn shook his head .
i shook my head with a shudder .
also , he cannot fix the time with any accuracy .
it is the canteen coffee trays you hear .
well , dont go on doing your best all by yourself , said tommy .
or at any rate i cant imagine why they should be allowed to be different .
we dont mean photography classes , at all .
could either of them be sonia goedler ?
about charlot kordayshe killed someone in his bath .
she answered him at once with the low softly breathed word : afraid .
on moral grounds ?
werent really any right answers that you could give .
he was waiting for the scotland yard men .
and ive decided to leave the stage and just be a mother .
even psychiatrists do not agree .
of course i dont know if she has also applied to any other agencies im on my way , said
he always used to say , this coffee is very moorish , meaning , you know , that hed like
and you have not been there since ?
entered politics , was mp for little stansmere .
he walked up and down the room .
who got him into it ?
she was very knowledgable about drugs and pills and that sort of thing .
a handsome , laughing daredevil of a fellow .
i love sending cables .
people seemed to be watching me .
the man looked uneasily to and fro , but after all , the news could not be kept secret .
a reconstruction of the movements of apparently innocent persons .
therefore it seems impossible that it can be anybodywhich is absurd !
darling , said my wife affectionately .
she murmured to herself .
he was fond of them all .
an idle young man , she thought , but good looking .
fourth month : promoted to cutting bread and butter .
no strange men seen about that evening ?
walking through that garden now , youd never think that the place had once been an air raid shelter and
i said it was queerabout ross and thirteen .
somehow it made me feel frightened .
well , i mean , theres always things you do remember .
asked sir oswald .
you said just now that none of us had anything on the chief .
and you want gloves in this weather , said violet .
doesnt she hate lovely louise !
reckon , said the porter .
she told me , i said , that she had always disliked him .
the case with dear griselda .
certainly there had been leakagesbetrayals .
but the answer was the same !
several of those present heard his remark , and one or two of them chaffed me about my conquest of
here were the clues that poirot had left for meand they meant nothing to me at all !
nothing suspicious happened the first night .
parker pyne was getting a little tired of basil chesters life being ruined .
there was the mysterious message from mr .
what on earth was the woman afraid of ?
a clumsy action or movement would have drawn your attention to him , but as a bona fide waiter none
much less mad than id imagined .
she did come up .
treves came to himself as he realized that a move was being made .
i think you may be able to help me .
came in about five oclock .
fighting .
jane expressed great surprise .
she had been alone in lindas room that morningand there was an indirect proof .
took his elephants trotters and his hippopotamuss toothy pegs and all the sporting rifles and whatnots .
they should all be put to death at forty , or perhaps thirty-five would be better .
william and mary , said stoddart-west .
john stillingfleet , md , and hercule poirot walked along the side of northway house .
her newest establishment is to be the lilac bush .
as to the others , the servants were busy with housework and cooking lunch .
shes gone .
upward rang up three women .
she drove on with her eyes fixed sternly on the road ahead of her .
he turned squarely on kirsten lindstrom , who flushed indignantly .
he had some slight satisfaction in seeing that the betts were impressed .
motive .
solemn thought , tis solemn thought .
why do you imagine i took this idiotic place here ?
on the other private .
find her ?
good night , jack .
but it is a comfortable house to live in .
the few people there were mostly foreigners .
he said that the game was up .
i went straight to scotland yard , asked for our old friend inspector japp , and laid the facts before
the tiny sitting room had been made cosy with chintz .
she put it in the lock , and turned it , then paused .
he had always felt alone .
you were very kind to her , i understand , said huish to leo .
i heard what you were singing just now .
no repressions about her .
that was to be the great day they were working for .
among her best known film adaptations are murder on the orient express ( _num_ ) and death on the nile
edna sniffed .
_num_ talking to arden at a quarter past ten on tuesday night .
ramon was my original professional name .
were they kidnapped ?
a happy thing ?
i have handled that kind before .
he was home from india .
in a few brief sentences he gave an account of recent happenings .
if i was thinking of having a go at guessing a murderer , a good capable murderer , id choose
perhaps the truth will be known before then .
yes , and that made me pretty suspicious , i can tell you .
was there , or was there not , a soft patter of feet along the terrace ?
so that you cannot mention anything else that particularly struck your notice ?
she was not in the least afraid of sir reuben , and she always stood up to him and gave
and shoot .
kind of electric brain , eh , what ?
good heavens , said mrs .
simon does away with his rich wife , inherits her money , and in due course will marry his old
vivien laughed scornfully .
now , look here , missus , youve got it wrong , you know .
i dont , i said .
most of the evening in scottys bar with some of my lower-class friends .
look here , sir .
i think most people are with lawrence .
i do remember i saw her cutting the flour because she was so clumsy that she capsized it almost at
happiness .
nothing known of her but her christian name .
deciding how i would deal with it .
as i look at it an archaeologist is a poor kind of fish .
its the killer again .
i must remember all that tomorrow morning .
dane calthrop , both you and ginger have already admitted the possibility of such a thing , or you wouldnt
does your sister darn well ?
evelyn hillingdon had taken his place by mollys bedside and lucky had promised to come and , as she expressed
you asked me if anyone were suspected of the crime .
one does not like to make definite assertions unless one has a little more definite knowledge .
the latter scrutinized them closely .
as we arrived at the gate , she said pleasantly : come in , wont you ?
luke had a momentary qualm during which he hoped that the clergyman might not be so efficient an antiquary as
what was her background ?
printed writing on it .
alistair blunt said quietly : thanks .
i may be making a mountain out of a molehill .
he saw her face now , and recognized her .
he looked round him appraisingly .
mercado right-handed or left-handed ?
importance , a man of infinite affairs !
, such as the bishop of london and king alfonso of spain , and of course with various actors .
she was good at mathematics .
first thing i looked for .
a thick cluster of black curls hid each ear .
had already noticed on the day before .
and littlegreen house seems to me just what i am looking for .
i know all about them , of course .
only miss lavinia believed devoutly in her sisters martyrdom and patience under affliction , and willingly ran errands and trotted
she was married to the other man .
so much so that i am going to ask you if you are really sure it is murder ?
and on tables ?
hes quite right , said miss marple .
midge said suddenly : im glad to get awayeven from lucy .
i dontnot much .
i mean , are you a real countess .
poor lad .
quite ridiculous .
much bloodshedmany deaths !
but she was now fully conscious .
im suspicious of these village parallels .
unhappy , frightened eyes looked out of a smiling confident face .
just what ninety-nine people out of a hundred would say !
oliver rose early , partook of two cups of tea and a boiled egg and started out on her quest
now if a woman were the head of scotland yard .
this fantastic plan of killing my stepmother didoh , how shall i put it ?
shell just go on disapproving and that wont do the trick .
what an extraordinary coincidence , said baker , staring at her surprisedly .
he was a funny little man , a great dandy , but wonderfully clever .
i did so yesterdaywarning them to look out for a car with two men in it whose passports will be
it had been a sudden impulse .
poirot found himself appraising her carefully .
cloade , if you are really quite certain your brother did not leave a will ?
anyway , lesley did all right , and his other girl friends werent pleased .
when i look at you , it seems much less , said poirot gallantly .
shall i speed her up a bit more ?
of the day was grey .
i say this suitcase is mine .
no , i said , shes not awfully keen on sales .
she was a gentle warm-hearted girl .
hastings began to show great interest in the turn being taken by the discussion , and poirot prompted miss amory
or possibly bill .
tuppence thought it was rather odd , too .
a big square-shouldered man of thirty years of age , with a round red beaming face , and dressed in
wrote that showed any sign of promise .
blore said : theres another thing .
but what is it all about ?
put me wise , he said succinctly .
clarke brought her a cup of coffee , but she refused any food .
technical .
are prepared to doand what they get away with !
im only just beginning to take it in .
she went down better with the older men than with the young ones .
i suppose you dont happen to remember when your stepmother was wearing these earrings last ?
i am afraid that i sent you rather a long list of questions .
dare say youre right , said lord whitfield .
isnt it a bit irksome for a young man like you ?
looking distinctly on edge , carelli replied offhandedly , very curious .
but he has improved very much of late .
when a brain grows old , it turns sick sometimes .
you have had much cooking to doeh ?
married and was happy in her engagement .
poirot , on the other hand , insists on a full-length book to display his talents .
he took any further words out of my mouth .
thats how i met ellie .
that , inspector , is my business .
i sprang out of bed and rushed out into the passage .
it would seem soyes , certainly it would seem so .
people would be spread out over the sands and the causeway .
im afraid , she said apologetically , i really havent time to see or notice anything during the holidays .
donovan put in a firm disclaimer , and jimmy backed him up .
van aldin pencilled upon them .
and she lighted my cigarette with it !
, _num_ , _num_ , _num_ , _num_ ; and mothers jewelry , _num_ ; and journey to pau ,
they need not taste of water .
the idea came to me on my way to the club one night , and i went straight off to
fleetwood was a big , truculent-looking man .
mary in berkshire .
go away from london , seek out your open country .
leidner had previously passed a cord .
he had an internal growth , however , which no one had suspected .
i think , he said , that you really have a noble face .
her voice was half defianthalf wistful .
mildred strete turned eager grateful eyes to her .
at a certain time , could make sure of being present when the door was broken inor at any rate
he was fully briefed .
but methods are very different now .
but its the plain truth .
it wasnt sessle who met doris evans at a cinema and induced her to come down to sunningdale .
i heard the words robbery and diamonds , and i heard him say , i dont know who to suspectand
pengelley is getting some gruel for his wife , and you introduce the fatal dose .
he had done it once or twice before .
said luke bluntly .
very upset and took on terribly when the old lady died .
why did you leave him ?
fourth man _num_ s .
she flung her head up proudly .
monsieur grosjean and your other european colleagues .
he was conscious of a pleasurable sense of anticipation .
he was neither picturesque nor violent , but whilst in england people who are picturesque and violent cause embarrassment and
blore said : yes , but if so , where is he ?
ackroyd , and ill tell him youre here .
but after the critical phase of illness had passed , you were down to the miss knights .
she was a nice woman who talked too much , but nobody gets murdered for thatunless of course they give
did he know what you were doing ?
seems odd to think of now .
where did i read that ?
i wish you would reconsider i cant .
he was just an old friend , nice and kind , and she wanted to get away from home where
it looks as though it were really pure chance that took him to the bassington-ffrenches , said frankie thoughtfully .
philip said : youll be safe enoughlocked in your room .
they hurry you so .
how did that happen ?

poirot , i had every reason to desire my fathers death !
whether i was wise to let him or not , i dont know .
i and my brothers were brought up the hard way , miss marple , and we werent encouraged to whine
but well just have a look at the fellow first .
burrows stared and then laughed .
nothing makes sense .
a miss birell went with him .
i protested because really i felt id done nothing to earn it .
of course , there must be lots of people walking about in london .

he may have died without knowing who his assailant was .
roger nodded and lit a cigarette .

perfectly monstrous , he fumed .
robinson suggested .
because theres not a shadow of a motive .
id no idea .
they were to make an early start the next morning as it was a full days motor run across the
belling , she exclaimed .
had a landscape gardener down from wisley or one of these places to design it .
on what subject ?
all over a baby just a few months old .
then we came to the subject of our house and the stories about gipsys acre .
she just cant remember its four for an ace and three for a king , she said with scorn .
after what had happened .
a man of excellent family , he felt fully at ease indulging any such sartorial whims .
but i did not think so .
she continued to nod her head gently .
psychologically perfect .
the three lookers-on were silent watching the passengers come ashore .
do you know anything about the way your wife was likely to have disposed of any property she had ?
armed with this galaxy of feminine beauty they proceeded to the bon temps where fresh difficulties and much expense awaited
but they hang them in some other countries .
it was quite an accomplishment .

he went into the box and swore that between the dates mentioned mrs .
it combines with the three sisters in russian literature , the three witches on macbeths heath .
then ill do my duty to the sick thoroughly .
the sentiment was vague , but the enunciation of it made james feel better .
alibi by typewriter , said weston with a short bark of a laugh .
oh , you mustnt worry , he said reassuringly , theyll land you somewhere all right .
you say that because youre jealous of his marrying rose humbleby .
rather interesting .
wandering disconsolately along the cromwell road he finally settled upon a small restaurant which served indian curries .
its nothing , really we will agree it is nothing .
well , i did what i could , but fortescue wouldnt listen to reason .
i rather thought so , said tuppence .
whatever his mysterious activities had been that evening could not affect the case .
still , the great thing was not to seem worried .
today , rhoda had wisely decided , it would be better to go out as much as possible .
the blue eyes were coldalmost frosty .
he escaped to england a month before war broke out .
few were taken .
i have been transplanted to ilium and back again .

because , he wagged a finger impressively , if you get across her , your cows will stop giving milk
i had caught him by the arm , and was clutching him with one hand , while with the other
surprise that drove them barmy .
you spoke of your mother who wept because she had bought your sister some new stockings on the very day
eaten , it was really stiflingly hot .
nothing against him .
the last two nights she had not been with the rest of the party .
well , well , i suppose i had better be clearing away these tea things .
human personalities as such had not previously interested him very much .
ill show him what his vengeance is worth next time i catch him taking my pheasants .
keep steady .
he had been recognized as english and doubtless , in due course , some pleasant noncommittal remark would be addressed
you are being careful .
lisa turned her eyes inquiringly on mcculloch .
he was perhaps the only person who was fond of her ; and she repaid his patronage with a fulsome
but they wouldnt tell him anything at the police station there .
i know now with what .
she turned and went out .
small noncommittal remarks .
on road .

but was that just another formula , just another fashion ?
ellis seems to have been an artistic sort of fellow .

my dear girl , im married .
the paternal sidethe fact that miss estravados had furtively picked up something from the floor last night .
of course youre quite right , said miss marple .
he looked round at his listeners .
my room ?
she had noticed nothing suspicious during the flight over .
cannot understand it .
, and theyre sensible thingsnot expensive paris fallals .
you dont mind talking about things , do you ?
i turned up the path we had taken the day before .
that is the thing you have to do now .
as before , there are no fingerprints on the handle of the dagger .
let me see themthis instant .
no , i didnt mean the house .
james , a sealyham of obstinate nature , had allowed his heavy sausagelike body to rest flat on the pavement

he stepped on by donovans side .
considerthis woman is a mother , a mother who has lost her only child .
meredith blake replied with distaste : he said : caroline must lump it .
he employed that power deliberately .
a tall , fair man .
i cannot enter into the subject .
dinsmead , almost in a whisper .
stay with you ?
looking back at the battlements behind him , he said irritably : what an abomination !
but you knew , said miss marple .
even a general ?
men cant take murder in their stride .
the armys all right in time of war , but its no good in peacetime .
i was looking for something in my despatch case a week or two ago , and by mistake i must

an expensive variety .

he stood a moment watching her relax , then he moved quietly away and went out on the landing .
let us return and continue our journey quietly .
her gaze went to miss brewis at the tea table and studied her dispassionately .
she stepped back , eyeing the arrangement with her head on one side .
greenholtz was rustling three pound notes and searching his pockets for coin of the realm .
well , that was what it was to me .
you will have to go to the inquest first , madame .
those other ailments had been trifling .
said harry .
sort of distant cousin or something .
its something special , isnt it ?
would you like to see over the farm and the dairy ?
i expect theyre trying all right .
and then came the question in bold type again : where are these women now ?
damn her !
handy to carry upon the person .
lance coming home that hasnt been home for years and i said to crump , i said : day out
i mean she wouldnt have said what she did if there was someone actually in the room who was concerned
now , as she looked out in the fading light , she noticed a mans figure just disappearing round the
the wide world was theirs to dance in .
all that is finished !
inspector last had appeared earlyat half past nine .
bland raised his eyebrows .
she was very generous , but she always wanted a return .
theyre young and happythe world in front of them .
but she saw theresa in the glass .
his face remained expressionless .
whom should we meet in another taxi face to face , but old prince usric .
you remember it ?
not until she had exhausted the subject of what she herself had felt , and what the doctor had said
who exactly did you feel was there in the hall when you found it so necessary to affirm that the
there were some odd thoughts going through miss marples mind .
segrave !
evening .
i knew that whoever it was would be the exact opposite of the man jane mason described .
i said , looking alarmed .
they have gone out to look at the automobile in the garage .
singing stream in a silent vale , a fairy prince in a prosy tale , oh theres nothing in life
it certainly has that appearance , said miss marple .
i , like everyone else , looked up when the ladies came in .
you are m .
silenced emily brewster .
ann answered it .
your man would probably not be suspected at all .
ive seen you before , said miss marple .
then i asked him what he felt now ; whether he was quite sure he could not come back to
i just acted like a flash .
twenty-nine poirot speaks it fell to me to ring up inspector japp the following morning .
she said , do doctors usually want to murder their patients wholesale ?
but then why does he not speak ?
but if i take the beastly thing , i shall just leave it at the door .
werent there ?
ah she shook her head .
it was there all the time .
hercule poirot nodded to himself .
she understands what a terrible time weve been through .
' ' your name , sir ?
the door to the hall opened , and constable jones entered , carrying a small booklet and a pair of
she seemed surprised to see bryan and he seemed to share her surprise .
whats your friend doing now ?
good for you , i expect .

spragg and her influence over their uncle might lead to trouble in the future .
the double bluff .
wooden bowls and large numbers of photographsmost of them , i noticed , of the same two people represented in
i hardly think we dare approach him .
i believe you , he said .
tuppence thrust this aside and opened the letter .
she seemed amused .
no , said poirot , no , i should not have thought so .
inglethorp murdered his wife as sure as i stand here , and if anyone but you hinted the contrary id
jack looked at him keenly .
his smile was discreetly tempered with gloom and showed only a fraction too much teeth .
he began laboriously .
so , if you dont mind he paused on the terrace .
murder had been possiblethat was all he needed to know !
im on the retired list now .
it was extremely unlikely that albert would have any knowledge of itindeed , it would have been fatal for tuppences
surely youre not going to make her get up , if she isnt feeling well .
lucy thanked her and walked along until she came to the post office which was a combination shop and post
you know what that always means .
but why , aunt cassie ?
thats what the inspector said .
lily was different .
dull path with shrubs and bushes and a few sparse trees either side .
you spoke just now of certain threats she had made .
wellits like this .
did her symptoms resemble those of arsenic poisoning ?
lynn spoke shortly .
both she and i had been so entirely taken up with our preoccupation over the mystery that we had forgotten
if you had seen her it would , at any rate , have narrowed the time of death for us
mrs 	vandefiyn and lady julia ?
but have a drink , wont you ?
mary burst out suddenly : thomas , im worried .
and this ?
nearly everything .
hed been talking about lumbar and cistern punctures , and he said one had to be very careful , otherwise
the house was very still excuse me , interrupted the superintendent , but can you give me an idea of
she said quietly : you have just seen my husbandand he has told youabout my father .
that narrows it down a bit , said the inspector .
griselda often comes out with surprising statements , but this seemed to me so surprising that i questioned it .
they wont charge him with it because it isnt necessaryand besides , i believe you cant be arrested twice on
his wife said : i cant think why he doesnt come .
good of you to look me up , sir , he said .
i thought shed just made a fool of herself about some young man .
and so she leaped to the truth .
when all this was settled evans cleared his throat nervously once or twice and then said : beg pardon ,
at the present minute , as far as i am concerned , the fat is in the fire .
inspector kelseys eyebrows rose very slightly as he studied it .
lloyd uttered no modest protest , she bowed and remained with her hands crossed in front of her .
it had been raining all day , he began smoothly , and then it suddenly cleared up .
oh , dear , said miss milray .
the wife of a celebrated archaeologist .
i dont know if youve ever heard of him but oh yes , said mr .
sheets , etc .
but she mastered herself , and said in a low voice : i will go and see .
as well what i shall call an execution , and we have a tragedy also .
' ' leave the island ?
wanting to get away .
it is the kind of crime , said poirot , of which one reads every day in the paper .
we have difficulties sometimes with the foreigners , but i always insist that that really doesnt matter now , said

tanios leant forward eagerly .
we had some evidence bearing on that point , said hale .
yes , that complicates matters .
poirot can conduct his examination of the passengers there .
ah , said poirot appreciatively .
only trying to push me overboard , i replied nonchalantly .
my dear man , i put it to you imperially .
so aid me in this matter .
gardener was scandalized .
it is a fundamental axiom of married life that you must lie to a woman .
there was a tap at the door and an elderly woman came in with a tea tray .
i shrugged my shoulders and burnt my boats .
they wont suspect us and therefore they wont be trying to put us out of the way .
the superintendent uttered a groan .
not as yet quite clear .
poirot said softly : mrs .
the war settled down to a grisly stalemate .
on an impulse he asked the other man to dine , and the german accepted .
and one , moreover , that it would not be at all easy to forget .
the person who did not share my enthusiasm was the wretched max .
she wished to stress certain points : the unenglish character of the crimethe possibly undesirable antecedents of miss estravados on
stewards , clancy and gale .
oh , its only a suggestion .
well , that was very nice of you , my dear , and i should like to see it very

he would have done that himself either today or tomorrow .

could it be patrick had really spoken to her ?
maggieoh !
and it seems the essence of his plan that nobody should leave .

where is miss johnson now ?
but until one person is proved guilty beyond any possible doubt , everyone else who is associated with the crime
it was helen .
emma crackenthorpe said kindly , dont hurry back .

the plane had been tampered withby a certain achmedsenior mechanic .

jeremy leaned over to study the card game on the floor .
well , he didnt make it and he did send me a line .
said lance .
nigel , however , took absolutely no notice of her .
virginia looked puzzled .
that will put her off the scentand its quite true because i left my yellow pullover there and i want
in another minute we shall be too late .
weston said : cool customer .
heres our doctor to see us , said miss knight gaily .
she had preferred another and a poorer man .
her mouse-brown hair was unflecked with grey and her steady hazel eyes set in the rather podgy face shone out
lucky that they had been there and not in the suitcase .
he leaned forward , his eyes boring into eileen richs face .
an english girl flushed and sunburntstroking a horses neck , stooping to weed a herbaceous border , sitting holding out
guilty as hell .
then the old lady died .
they had not seen him till this moment , and his appearance had the suddenness of a conjuring trick .
youll be seeing the ghost in a minute if you work yourself up like this , said tommy kindly .
satterthwaite shivered .
this hot dry weather will soon clear that away .
wont youersit down , mrs .
she assumed that i knew the story .
i know next to nothing about the man .
i stood helpless , not daring to look at suzanne .
it would have been wonderful , said eileen rich .
neither of us would admit what was happening , went on mrs .
first millennium .
levitt walked in .
miss kingston bruce hesitated , then said rather ungraciously .
it might , said tuppence , but that wouldnt be really what were looking for , would it ?
naturally its upsetting .
and iris didnt want it to be anthony browne .
younger man with a black moustache .
it was a crude painting with little merit except the doubtful one of old age and dirt .
its no good just saying that i couldnt help myself .
_num_ those particular circumstances have passed away , you now , deservedly , one of the most popular figures in
particulars ?
poirot said : no , you did not only imagine it .
osborne , his anguished respectability appeased , chatted cosily of the amenities of bournemouth , its excellent climate , its
poirot turned the implement carefully in his hands .
meditatively kicking the lobelia edging .
they finished the meal .
ill ring up the lorrimers .
i not ?
i ought to be able to get on their track all right .
of it by passing it out through the ventilating hole in the window ?
and i hope you will understand and not think what i am asking is tiresome oror unpardonable in any way
and crisply , across the room , frances spoke .
little gerda , was that her name ?
' here we go gathering nuts and may , ' hummed sarah .
you are going to frame me ?
poirot , however , disregarded all denials .
whats this , megan ?
he pushed open the door at the top and went into a room .
they were two single compartments with a communicating door between them .
i went up and went right off to sleep .
said symonds .
marys reproachful gaze .
i heard a sound of quick hurried breathing .
but why are you telling me this ?
we lunched heartily , but i found poirot somewhat distrait and inattentive .
her eyes searched him incredulously .
am i interrupting ?
this doors open into the hall .
the three men took their seats quickly at the bridge table and picked up their cards , just as clarissa
hastings , use your eyes .
lucias eyes searched poirots face as though trying to decide whether to confide in him .
you understand , i do not want you to be clever !
horsham it was , looking as he had looked half an hour ago , stalwart , trustworthy , cleft chin
' in any case , ' continued japp , ' she ' s holding out on us .
and she said , you dont deserve to have got off , mr warwick .
could you do something to it ?
i will realize all my dreams .
its the shock , said hester .
its rather difficult to know what he is driving at .
if endowments ever do much good .
interrupted virginia .
but in peacewell , in peace such men usually end up in prison .
thats why its all right for me marrying john .
another girl i knewbut that was when i was youngwent off with one of them africans .
made a good story of it , she did .
do you , my dear ?
kay had suddenly lost control of herself .
emerson wrote to me about her from cambridge .
that person up to the law , or would you be tempted to shield them ?
this is my wife , detective inspector hardcastle .
well , i wont take any more of your time .
the waitress regarded the photograph , her head a little on one side .
that , yes , but i meant more than that .
he led her forward .
she seemed to brush aside the fact as unimportant .
it was mad .
his silvers all right , and his waiting at table is not too bad .
it doesnt seem real somehow .
thirty-two katherine and poirot compare notes you have changed , mademoiselle , said poirot suddenly .
nobody could come in from outside without a key .
' she was , he perceived , an enthusiastic bather .
he wanted marguerita clayton .
said sir charles when they were speeding towards london .
had they not persistently followed the wrong car , they might by now have found the boy .
quite , quite , said poirot , hastily .
that is what i believed .
poirots voice quickened with interest .
after that , i will interview the servantsor rather my assistant , miss robinson , will do so .
margery gale was a big squarely built girl .
all one had to do was to be careful to not rick an ankle , fall through a hole ,
two minutes later andrew pennington made his appearance .
and went up to see morley again ?
dacres that she would think it over before making a final choice .
he was uplifted , carried out of himself .
you read this , mademoiselle ?
come to live on his property .
' sir george grunted .
the first was a pencil scrawl in a little notebook .
i dont suffer fools gladly , you know , he said , half-apologetically , but by all accounts you are
those were the good old days .
yes , i thought it very odd .
not to be afraid anymore to sleep .
wade , coaching nowadays is so good that almost anyone can play fairly well .
i will get him , said lady rustonbury .
ive noticed that , said anthony .
she had liked miss marple very much .
meeting , at the head of the table , i myself passed them , as it were , in review
then , when it seemed you werent going to let me in , i used this .
upon them unobserved (i nearly uttered an indignant protest , but quelled it .
never mind about miss knight , said miss marple , coming to a decision .
i know nothing about it !
he did wonder .
a miracle was going to help that poor lady .
if caroline had behaved like a reasonable human being so you take no responsibility ?
it was the kind of establishment in which you could spend a million francs on an object worth half a

the path below .
they read it out on the television , and i must say its a good yarn on its own .
its been such funall of it .
safe and smug and prosperousand full of platitudes !
said japp good-humouredly , winking at me .
cant you put some of your people on to mrs .
take this up to mademoiselle and ask if she will see me .
on the inside was a publishers blurb .

i just ran the antique side .
pneumonia ?
sir eustace ?
then we all went to the studio for music .
i become poetical .
hoffmans voice was wary .
i nursed and looked after him true .
its traditional , of course , said mrs lacey .
we saw a lot of messy-looking shacks , and then by good luck we found this .
a fat dragoman was standing talking to carol with quite unintelligible fluency .
but very sure indeed .
her troubles have made her so bitter and peculiar , poor dear !
her long dark eyes turned to him .
lights go out .
four voices gave assentand then immediately afterwards gave quick surreptitious glances at each other .
they turned to the left out of the hotel gate and entered the cool shade of the public gardens .
the snowcapped mountains of kurdistan .
it doesnt turn on there .
why are you sure ?
the manuscript was typed .
stood here .
he half whispered .
dennis rathbone .
there must be simply heaps along here .
turning , she left the room .
if ever there were extenuating circumstances , there were in this case .
you could have told him that he was in dangerafter all , he was the real obstacle !
he attracts youehthis young man ?
on the following day mr .
seem promising .
defiantly .
richard asked , turning to his wife .
they drew their rations , but they then drew an extra pound of butter and an extra pot of jam
rymer was a tall woman , big-boned .
knew all the right people .
but they couldnt fool me .
are they sorry about it afterwards ?
supposing , hastings , that in each of these cases that i have outlined , there was one alien note
laidell was a large house .
superintendent sugden said : i suggest , mrs .
in half an hour , and went away down the village .
george turned a face of dignified reproach on battle .
so long as i can keep the jennson eating out of my hand , i can get a lot of

mrs bantry sat down and groaned .
spying a bell inset on the mahogany counter , spence pressed it .
really after , since roberts would not know the real object of his search .
precisely , said hercule poirot .
theres quite a lot about .
everything had been turned over and scattered .

you must realize , monsieur poirot , that the poor child is dead .
jimmy thesiger knew perfectly well that he was taking loraine wade out to dinner .
you have never purchased any yourself at a chemists or for photography ?
you came up here ostensibly , my dear , to go to the sales .
she said to herself restlessly : why shouldnt i be happy ?
we have come to the point where lies will serve no longer .
freedom ?
poirot stood looking after them a minute , then he rang the bell and asked for miss pope .
two men in a bakers van were witnesses of the accident .
i shall say that he came in that night with blood upon himthat he confessed to me .
oh dear , she said , whats the matter ?
it depends where and how they happen and why .
thats any real excuse .
it would not move .
rowland firmly .
, he said .
there was quite a little competition to give celia her coffee .
, i gave in .
poirot said sharply , eh bien ?
i helped her with the spanish authorities .
from there they moved on to the chest of drawers .
you took your employers dog out for his usual walk , brought him here and went on to the park
i replied truthfully : you .
shes a syrian from damascus .
servants are so tiresome , she said .
no , i mean more than that .
youve taken the wrong cup .
well , i said , go on .
captain henderson indeed .
poirot and signor richetti at last found him .
she is carrying .
but it isnt wonderful now ?
he took out his pipe and began stuffing the bowl .
and nobody that i can find ever saw miss emily and mary higgins at one and the same time .
of distaste , looking down on them .
nowadays young people seem to think they can just go about doing anything they choose .
thats what weve got to face .
deceased .
it takes us no further .
perhaps its just as well i should go before that boy of yours gets infatuated with yet a third girl
i knew the name that selma goetz passed under in genoa .
she stood there softly at philips elbow , looking down at him whilst kirsten raised his limp hand and felt
my seat at the top of the theatre .
but you cannot see .
a child , for instance .
theres odd folks come to it by all account , said the local man .
what frightened him ?
he doesnt talk about themthats not his way .
whats happening up there ?
but possibly not so harmless as they sounded .
three months ago , edward robinson , in company with a few hundred thousand other young men , had gone

she understood .
the old bad things must destroy each other .
it was dr .
if she married anyone else , it was all to go to his nephew , harry dalehouse .
we didnt hear anything in particular , except a bit of fuss outside dr .
yesnot showing it , you know .
murder is a drama .
you seem to be taking very kindly to this , satterthwaite , said sir charles , with a twinkle of
the death of marlene had been a bad shock to youyou had not had the least idea of what was
who have come before me to be tried for murder , have been guilty .
that always goes down well .
mrs boynton , wrapped in a thick coat , was sitting in a chair , waiting to depart .
so when i came to sketch out the play , out went poirot .
she drew on her cigarette .
there was some justice in the remark .

raymond : did any stranger come to see mr .
he hasnt gone over to gossington , has he ?

he looked around the dining room .

oh , the stupid little man , murmured hercule poirot .
the girl apparently swallowed this not very plausible story .
he remarked suddenly , with an intonation of relief .
this time she was carrying a large enamel basin and a knife .
well , there are pip and emma .
right , ill see what i can do .
the family , miss cardwell ?
the man you did kill , you killed in a rageand you did not really mean to kill him ,

iv a quarter of a mile away , gwenda lay dry-eyed and sleepless .
why did he decide suddenly to send me out to new zealand ?
hes a big man , sir oswald .

the woman apologized quickly .
that is a great relief and we can now leave with a clear conscience .
his bright , rather pig-like eyes watched bunch closely .
to tell us what it is .
yours , georgine .
did he find out she was being poisonedbut how could he find out ?
i imagine not , starkwedder remarked .
but i do not think so .
he said with a gasp : mr .
that we are sure of .
its just a lot of queer marks .
i had it with me .
fowler , next door to mrs .
what i have to say will not keep .
it doesnt matter my saying this nowso long afterwards .
such a revolutionary remark shocked mr .

what would you do about it ?
there was salt in it , sir , it wasnt me .

now , bridget , youve got to get along to that pawnshop we marked down .
it wasnt burglary at all , cried miss bunner .
im mad , and i cant help it .
but they all converge and meet at one place , meadowbank .
i shall laugh to see all their faces .
affairs and gossip , saying they missed rube a lot .
her voice shook a little but she was in full command of herself .
not only that , she had seen this car , or one exactly like it , seen it only yesterday
oh , not your fault , my dear boy , not your fault .
gabler ?
derek seemed momentarily taken aback .
her passport had been made out for paris , where she was going to join the staff of a hospital

every date , every timehe always gets it wrong .
she was wearing a marvellous confection of orange and black , with a little hat that shaded her face .
is this what you mean ?
indeed , she felt happier than she had done for a long time .

he hailed a taxijustifiable expense in view of the piece of information he had just been given over the telephone

after dinner , when coffee had been drunk , poirot cleared his throat in a slightly embarrassed manner , not
now and then he passed his hand across his lips as though to hide a smile .
now , miss eyelesbarrow , lets get down to brass tacks .
and wait .
arlenas not good for linda .
tredwell , when did arthur leave ?
a peacock is very decorative , isnt it ?
you didnt notice what kind of head he had , i suppose ?
she fancied that lady westholme had been quite close by .
melchett agreed .
what is it to you where i may have been , here , or at warmsley vale or in timbuctoo
its so very hard with electricians and then carpenters and people .
nobody dreamed she was quite as well off as she was .
the mechanism of crimeand its motive .
and you can tell me nothing about the secretary that evening ?
shes the greatest gossip in the village .
he could hardly have helped overhearing poirots thoughtful remark as he bundled the torn papers back again : and the
but she was a good-looking girl , i believe .
what a suspicious old devil you are !
look here , say the kids got hold of these lettersletters that are absolutely damning !

the facts were all there , ready , waiting for the little flash of illumination that should weld them together
the train was late .
his face suddenly went rather white .
with a slight inclination of her head she passed out of the dining car .
then he said , his eyes sliding past me to the window : youhave been up at old hall today
in that very clever letter you forged you told me to tell nobody .
lancaster had become unknowingly involved .
but he felt he couldnt trust his judgment on the subject of miss cowley .
donald fraser , who was engaged to the dead girl .
ill be back in half an hour .
such an experience was no novelty to canon pennyfather .
it was at this moment that colonel melchett seized his opportunity , and cleared his throat loudly .
the doctor looked rather surprised .
it was like that .
claudia was a healthy girl too , but she just fell from her horse and died .
once the pleasures of evil get a hold on you , you cannot draw back .
the person must have been seen by someone in the vicinity of the crime at the appropriate time .
bex turned up a path that branched off at right angles .
nono , of course not , he wasnt there .
thats the way you get chaps , you know .
she gets threatening notesone after anothertheres not been anything today , has there ?
literary effort of mine , said the doctor , blushing a little .
the country became wooded and hilly .
he did not usually regret it at all .
and everyone would have been very fed up .
ruth frowned .
certainly i have more to say .
whynow you mention iti believe i did hear a kind of a bang .
there didnt seem any further link leading from there .
that was what had put the idea into coras head .
youre sure you dont want me to no , no , ill see to it , said father .
perhaps if she just leant against the wall here for a little ?
well , fascist if you like to say it that way , what does it matter ?
and propose to another within a fortnight .
but theres absolutely no place one could hide oneself in that great barn of a roomand i suppose thats where
perfectly pleasant and natural .
then briefly and concisely he narrated the events of his walk home and the strange sequel .
anyone may have sent those .
its nothing , darling , its nothing at all , he kept saying .
its possible , said dr .
it cant be the memoirs , said anthony .

miss bulstrode waved that aside impatiently .
that sir henry suggests .
i could tell by the redness of her eyelids , but her manner was unchanged from its old blunt gruffness
having been repeatedly warned not to do so , and who had been found in a nearby copse or gravel
the amiable edward agreed .
the affair marches , does it not ?
she was looking from one to the other of them , humorous , charming !
calgary showed slight amusement .
and some of these vewy special leaves with them ?
thats what they called the battery .
beryl gilliatt turned abruptly .

a dinner basket was being handed up and received through the window by the maid .

there had been so many exciting young men , ringing rosemary up , taking her out .
slightly bewildered the whole colourful pageant of the story was entrancing .
well , darling , its been ever such a success !
i shall want to interview the other people who were here last night .
monumental old lady who glared at poirot with such ferocity that he beat an apologetic retreat .
simeon said quickly : oh , sorrynothing portentous about it .
it seems extraordinary that he didnt take anything , commented her mother .
but i dont really think the old lady who said it knew what she was talking about .
poor henry , said sylvia .
yes , thats just it .
if a thing sounds silly , i always want to hear about it .
is this what you meant ?
i always take it with me .

i began to ask myself certain questions .

with deft fingers he tossed the things out of the suitcase .

aluminium saucepans , cups and saucers and teapots , hammered copperware , silverwork from amara , cheap watches , enamel
hester argyle .
everyone looked towards me inquiringly .
probably wandered out and looked about her .
if the money is missed , parker is sure to remember having seen her come down those stairs .
finally , i heard from him back in this country again .
he found bridget in her room superintending the packing of her clothes by a housemaid .
you didnt know , said sarah .

i had a good view through the crack of the door .
you knew her before she came here , did you not ?

tommy said : youve just said itweve got to be !
i insist on accompanying you back to merlinville .
his lips tightened .
this jewellery was at the bungalow , just locked up in a jewel case .
ive done for them from the beginning , yes , sir .
with nobody else there , i said .
i want to come first .
didn ' t .
at that moment mr .
he had protested she could not know her mind .
like it really .
he noticed that the young man was almost unusually perturbed .
lord whitfield has committed at least seven murders to my certain knowledge and probably a lot more .
the doctor was not completely satisfied , but he saw that sir james was determined to say no more ,
and what exactly are you and he going to do ?
inspector slack looked contemptuous .
oliver looked back at poirot .
not so much because of actual happenings but because of the possible causes behind them .
i was to meet lawrencemr .
he seemed baffled and perplexed .
he works himself into such curious states .
barbara franklin sighed .

hes in deadly earnest about his careerhes got great gifts , you know , and the makings of a true
yes , but that was for miss rosamunds sake .
then he added : who did you have staying here yesterday , mrs .
she had a great power of love and hate but no stability .

it was one of his ways in and out of the house .

what is this ?
no appreciation , as i said just now , of literature .
it was pink and sweet-scented .

by the way , i havent asked you what your interest is in the case .
he added thoughtfully , douglas gold is a very stupid young man .

and now for the last stage .
that is quite right , monsieur .
, and she provided against that difficulty by ordering a dinner basket and by locking herself in her compartment .
it is a nuisance to have to break off what youre doing and come all the way back from the
shocking !
cross-legged buddhas leered down from convenient niches , brass benares trays and tables encumbered the floor space .
there might be some sense in that .
theyre welcome to it , said sir charles generously .
you cant do it now , said virginia softly .
youre the top one , youre the grand one .
they are a serious source of profit , and they are always cut down green .
i suppose i was in a way , or i wouldnt have married him .
i always think theres something so dramatic about a will .
he and his brother are the real owners of bertrams hotel .
we have here also a cancer research department , and important work is being done on tuberculosis .
it wouldnt work , edward .
then she remembered one slight incident , and she based her last appeal upon it .
why werent you vaccinated in the arm ?
he spoke clearly and slowly , delivering himself of much good sense and shrewd acumen .
but the solving of themno , it is not the creative power that is needed .
it is in a transposed key .
and yet perfection is undoubtedly an irritating thing .
i cant explain further , but i beg you to accept my word that it is so .

it was gayer and much brighter .
then the very decided sound of someone mounting the stairsdoors opening and shuttingfeet going up to the attics overhead .
adam told him .

what i really came to ask you was whether by any chance you had a bible .

i care for them still as much as , if not more than , ever .
there was a meditative note in his voice .
my dear , they have real muffins too .
i mean b-u-y , said tommy .
miss williams said drily : thats one thing to be thankful for !
theres no one else , is there , tuppence , that youve got your eye on ?

he was getting on so well with it .
it was gone in a flashbut he knew it .

poirot stood as though stunned .

he described his adventures at the grange and their sinister sequel .

he always kept his suite locked .

im asking you frankly : do you think he did it ?
you think that this girl , jacqueline de bellefort , is incapable of a premeditated cold-blooded murder ?
quite fresh , too .
a sick beating at ones heart .
satterthwaite agreed that nothing on earth could surpass a really fine tenor voice .
poirot drew himself up and glanced at me reproachfully .
was dictated by anothers brain .
they have a lot of keening and wailing first and then plenty of drink and a sort of mad whoopee
theres been nothing much in the papers , ive been glad to see .
you will find it is as i say .
and she ran out into the drive and laid in wait for you with the hammer .
nothing could be more old-fashioned than we are !
behind him came the bulk of marcus tio .
the sooner the better , said frankie .
well , thats lucky always , isnt it ?
of his bluff and his bluster , was essentially a weakling .
im terribly sorry .
however , i relapsed into sleep , rearranging my roman nose to look its bestfull-face , rather than profile .
and then george had received anonymous letters (from whom ?
were not sure .
the organization you are up against is quite ruthless .
i hope you dont suggest that michael went to his rooms simply to avoid seeing me ?
there might have been splinters in it .
all the different types .
her voice cut like a knife .
dont like these earnest middle-aged women you meet nowadays , all got a cause with a capital c .
then of course they found out we were meeting and he put a stop to it .
in my opinion , and this is only an opinion , ratchett was killed at some time very close upon
a breathless dorothy , looking pale but pretty , came hurrying along to join him .
she paused , and then added : in that case id better put down mother and myself as wellthat makes
clipp got into conversation with some of her fellow travellers .
she looked round her enquiringlythen , resigning herself , she looked at her wristwatch , exclaimed at finding how late
she lied about the dog , you said , i reminded him .
or what one does .
it sounds interesting , said mrs .
you know him , eh ?
not much to go on , i admit .
he was not going to let this blackbird bogey divert him from the logical and sober investigation of murder by
im very matey reallypeople interest me enormously .
wimborne gave a crabbed little smile .
but they told you she was away .
the pronouncing of his own name tends to harden the arteries .
she went on in her gentle , soft voice : i had such a charming nurse looking after me when
in spite of himself the superintendent was favourably impressed .
bouc finishing an omelet .
i forgot to ask you .
the more emotional they feel the less command they have of language .
he has always had a remarkable memory .
just me .
at any rate there are no arrangements for buying food on the train from baku to batumyou must take everything
' pamela gave a sudden shiver .
i looked at him with more interest .
as the result of her discovery .
after having made a great fuss about going to meadowbank and being quite sure she wouldnt like it there ,
where you see a vulture hovering , there will be a carcass .
real nasty bit of goods .
his eyes were not on her .
the only thing ishow to proceed now ?
but she hadnt wanted to wait .
i took it and came back into the room .
he left it there .
miss brewis had intimated that lady stubbs knew very well what she was doing .
when it was painted and where it is .
he walked out into the hall , shaking his head a little .
' murmured sarah in a stifled voice .
nodont go in there .

theres just one other thing id like to say .
hes been everything to me .
not to be despised .
british sympathies .

and hes been wonderfulhis courage , his pluck !
of course , as soon as i got back with the police officer , i said why , its mr
i want to see if youre as clever as you always make out .
she just moves about as she likes , said alicia coombe .

sir ernest sat down again with a satisfied smile on his face .

i was just going to give a talk on how i write my books and now i shall get my
edward simply wouldnt know ; you , midge , are always so practical .
this time his eye was professional , not aesthetic .
the police will know all about archer soon enough , i said .
a thin dark woman came out to meet them and edward spoke to her rapidly in french .
but , besides myself and colonel race , only two people were presentsimon doyle and dr .
my lips are sealed , said hercule poirot .
you know it as well as i do .
and it is to assist you in arranging this that you have sent for me ?
just one other question i should like to ask you , miss marple .
id like to know just what kind of maggot youve got in your brain .
and ignorant of sutton chancellor and anxious to sell residences as yet only half built at what seemed ridiculously exorbitant
id rather it was mademoiselle blanche , wouldnt you ?
he followed her along the corridor .
in addition he and his friend fletcher moss took good photographs , and published several books of photographs of famous
that is what i told her .
she eyed tuppence with deep curiosity as she approached , increasing her pace and starting a conversation before she reached
perenna had turned away to the door that led into the kitchen .
then he said , almost unwillingly , its much simpler , of course , if you say nothing .
she had not really screamedit was all in the dream .
the dress was all wrong .
did you hear any other shotone down in the wood , for instance ?
' he liked to tell people who dined with him there just exactl where augustus john had been wont to
the vicar nodded with complete comprehension and possible sympathy .
oh , cant you understand ?
i said immediately that i thought i could manage something .
we could have sent her a cable to that effect from cannes .
was your daughter in the habit oferreturning home late ?
no story for your damned paper .
of course ive got brains , declared mr .
those of importance we will put on one side ; those of no importance , pouf !
certainly if you like , said miss gorringe , rather coldly .
they led upright lives just as she , emily brent , had led an upright life she had never done
said inspector neele .
went to the raised stage .
marriage will cure me , i expect .
michael spoke with a charming confidential rueful air .
but it was tommys note clinched matters .
she turned away and said she had to go and give a pep talk to the butcher .
is he out ?
i signed a power of attorney and gave it to andrew lippincott .
we think that giles began , but inspector primer , with unexpected authority , held up a restraining hand .
so farthe plan is obvious , but what puzzled me was why our murderer took for granted that there would
pierce with a kind of melancholy enjoyment .
i shant take that as my text .
i was condemned to stay on here playing a part .
they were coming now close beside the nasse boathouse .
and she is on the side of justice !
if this letitia blacklock dies before her , they will come into a vast fortune .
of the day ?
you have viewed the body of the deceased ?
his title ?
demanded miss de haviland .
i asked somewhat sceptically .
he had suddenly wanted to visit her now .
my dear , sir rowland warned her , i love you , and i will always love you dearly .
it hadnt been so bad at school .
he went through the doorway .
shed got one of the best heads for business ive ever met .
seventeen excuse me , maam , i wonder if i might speak to you a minute .
we may hunt together again and then perhaps i stopped .
there now , ive told you quite as much as is good for you .
nevile frowned .
to make a call of any distance , or a london call , upset her severely .
nothing very exciting .
but really , one could not imagine leo .
a valuable fact .
ive been talking to mr .
she must have been dead at least an hourperhaps more .
herman isaacstein smiled .
it might have been me , said hercule poirot .
ill never forget it never !
had parted several years ago .
i shall talk to him .
just coming up to you and saying that .
and there was a tall handsome dark girl called claudia hardcastle who seemed to live for horses , though hampered
but she wasnt able to do it .
but you werent dazzled .
if she isnt about , look for her .
magdalene went scarlet .
ill write it to you .
to shut you up in any way .
you can save her ?
normally the partner-in-crime of hercule poirot .
they crept stealthily upstairs .
one unknown lunatic at large !
halliday stared at her , his face growing redder and redder .
you mustnt , she admonished herself sternly .
as you say , any time .
he looked down at her .
that seems rather remarkable .
so many things are hard , m .
but its got to be explained , sir .
he knew fear again .
almost colliding as i did so with a manan unpleasant-looking man with a nose disproportionately big for his face .
he is a great criminal , that man .
she said , three ?
the part was a difficult one , especially in the first act , where the lines cannot help .
there was some found in the pocket of your masters coat .
they may get on to someone if were in time .
he wore gold-rimmed pince-nez , and had a curious impassivity of feature .
satterthwaite followed his example .
tell me , mrs hailsham-brown , he continued , you havent lived here for very long , have you ?
students from the youth hostel arrived in batches conversing loudly in foreign tongues .
i shall go up tomorrow , but for twenty-four hours at most .
then she laughed .
what an idiot ive been !
to cooks , and raise the question of fresh reservations at fez and marrakesh .
you cant smash a watch like that without opening the case .
saying a things murder before you know its murder is libel and you might be had up in court for
' the acknowledged queen of detective fiction .
cant have that .
wore , came to me and said : will you be coming to your table soon , mr .
no one would hide money in a place like that unless he wanted it to be found .
just love , i suppose , said anthony lightly .
and the girl had nothing but the tea and the sandwiches ?
i always thought she was the kind of woman who would stick at nothing in order to get what she
they say hes a millionaire twice over .
oh yes , oh yes .
that is why he was anxious to be the one to tackle her .
what isthis kitchen ?
by the way , those chocolates were poisoned ?
she was walking along the cliff path and she fell .
but you see , it may be a question of identification .
, arlena .
of yours of repeating everything indiscriminately ?
george raised his head and looked at the ceiling .
you are wise , esa , said hori approvingly .
i didnt quite like the doctor .
jeremy sat down again at the bridge table .
the big pockets .
and there was someone in the room she had heard somethingsurely she had heard something .
it was dark here , of course , except for the blazing dish .
slattery .
then hori had gone on to speak of changes that came from within , of a rottenness that left no
had almost forgotten her , of his marriage to the beautiful viola .
much practising somewhat oppressive .
he was paid for doing it , of course .
blunt got up at once and moved to the door .
symmington had encountered disaster in her first marriage , she had certainly played safe in her second .
i am sorry for her .
weve lost her .
if they pick up your trail it will lead to yarrow and to a man in a car .
perhaps youll give me an explanation of this ?
did you enjoy the food ?
he sorted through them quickly .
heard of a frenchman called gerard ?
from across the room sir george said : hattie .
he uttered a few florid phrases and took his leave .
it doesnt matter , said phillipa coldly .
it was very clever of my husband to get you so promptly .
he asked anxiously , as we walked through the park .
she is alive .
she was awell , she was a lady .
you know ive got those specimens of helens handwriting from kennedy ?
and dulcie seems so unfamiliar .
he spread out the paper .
there she wasthere they both were , the pair of them , one flaxen-haired , one dark , matching as
impudent young jackanapes !
' ask me any questions you like , ' she said .
blatts apparent ambition to be the life and soul of any place he happened to be in .
i mean , what could one say ?
it wasnt here when i done the room on thursday morning , i says .
in spite of himself , a cold hand seemed tightening round his heart .
still mrs .
ada was worded , but i couldn ' t bring myself to treat the matter seriously .
and doesnt look particularly like him really .
he wanted to impress , and he only succeeded in looking silly .
he stopped finally at the end of a corridor and pressed a button in the wall .
i have shocked you .
of fever up in the bush somewhere .
ill never forget itnever !
and what , may i ask , are you reading ?
notrouble there ?
she hasnt got any idea , i think , of the gravity of things .
whats this , inspector ?
what do you mean , you miserable , shrivelled up old woman ?
where were you at the time of his death ?
them so , and a few days afterwards he got a letter offering him a job in peru or somewhere
he has been gagged , hastings .
he drew a long , deep breath .
then , stroking his luxuriant moustache with exquisite care , he smiled as he commented , softly , me ,
opium pills , to allay the pain .
was it suicide , or was it murder ?
by sight is the kind of coincidence that ought to mean something .
evening , beatrice .
and youve been here ever since ?
but how tedious is retirement !
but the strange woman made a quick gesture of refusal .
him off .
a free man , make up your mind .
i am familiar , of course , with your name , m .
is it , then , so psychologically impossible ?
pedler .
jacqueline turned and walked gropingly , blinded by tears , towards her cabin .
yes , thats what i thought .
one or the other of them .
ive been thinking about them a lot .
not a boy any longer whos the other one ?
glynne , what really is going to happen in this business .
hemming from the hall .
i was making a guess .
ah , yes , the stuck pig ?
carol said slowly : it is trueshe was a funny colourher face was very redmore so than usual .
a shrewd , hard look came into miss marvells eyes which belied their childlike appearance .
lynn went to first-class schools .
its been a pleasure , i assure you , returned george nonchalantly .
no , you will see this concentration will work in the end , said tuppence .
sir edwardi want you to help me .
the immediate outcome of the matter was that imhotep made hurried preparations for departure .
all these years .
and this miss gilchrist seemed rather doubtful about relatives and their addresses , but she knew about us .
he is very sound .

bundle paid him with a sweet smile .
but i dont know anything at all .
one day the supreme catastrophe occurred .
a sail , eh ?
he shook his head , amused at the idea .
she came down the stairs and across the hall .
what about this de sousa ?
theres an american , too , said jessop .
chapter _num_ i when hastings came down to breakfast late the following morning , after having slept long and well
but where was tuppence now ?
i dont know that it will be such a pleasure .
astral bodies , said aunt kathie .
for his friends .
exactly what she had expected mr .
harrys eyes opened .
it is the idol house of astarte .
much better not .
yes , said tuppence , i think youve got more hope than i have .
asked katherine in a low voice .
that ' s so , isn ' t it ?
i very happy .
and there was the girl with the camera .
we shan ' t be able to prove anything against her , and yet we both know that she '
it is my part to make sure that there shall be no gross misstatements , no tampering with the known
oh yes , i understand .
a perfect bywordand would like to ask one or two questions .
lancaster , i think she said her name was ?
one , i believe , is a hungarian wine .
thats a pretty tall coincidence , you know .
i am assisting the french police in an important case .
staffords eye went round to the fourth man .
brilliance of her achievements .
i wrinkled my brow .
he always felt that transportation was a thing that had saved many a potential criminal in the past .
its just a headache .
yesen route to other places in morocco , of course .
youd have to judge your moment .
i entered this grove of trees i have felt a curious impression and sense of evil and menace all round
im only eighteen .
she told him that shed make him sorry for what hed done , and she said she hated him more
kettering ?
race came out of bessners cabin and said authoritatively : would you mind all clearing off ?
she closed the box again , pressing her fingers firmly on its surface .
if youd seen her that night when i first went to the grange !
my son is a fool and always has been , said esa .
oh , yes , said miss bunner .
i never saw much of the restarick lot .
spence raised his head , closed his eyes and appeared to reflect .
i could have a headache and go to my roomno , someone might come up and want to minister to
he sprang forward .
tanios and asked her questions about the children .
there , there .
that is rather soon .

possibly longer .
she had said , striving to fight back a sudden fear : because hes dead ?
then it must have beenshe hesitated for just a momentof course , on sunday afternoon .
we were both rather relieved .
he looked round the lounge , came back to where he had been sitting .
meaning jason rudd ?
i dont know what gladdie would say , im sure .
i took some lunch with me and ate it in a spinney .
im very sorry .
i soon found out about itone of the arab servants .
and retrieved a ball of wool that the old lady had dropped .
hercule poirot said : you forget the governess .
i could get along with one stick now , but i couldnt do any athletic feats .
i observed that .
you heard of the tragedyhow ?
twelve new lamps for old i miss bulstrode had another faculty which demonstrated her superiority over most other women .
im not a magician .
it was a short , concise document .
she was so tired , so dreadfully tired .
tanios and his wife stayed there for easter ?
six poirot looked with interest at the long , sensitive face of roderick welman .
there must be somethingsome piece of information that she herself has inadvertently got hold of , perhaps without knowing what
its looking too perfectly frightful .
there will be a laboratory built out at the back .
i told him what i thought of him .
the people she lived with , and worked for in london .
his face was white and strained .
you picked up the gunpick it up i dont want to !
you couldnt ?
miss greer was sitting outside near the open library window and heard a good deal more .
you are warning me , said harrison in a low voice .
one often has that experience .
listen to me , i suppose .
poirot rapped gently upon the door of the lodge .
in julias room there was a drawer full of snapshots of the south of france .
she was wearing a large pale-pink hat which looked odd at the breakfast table .
isnt it november , about the third week in november ?
her steady eye met his .
hes not in a hospital as a result of an accident .
was only natural she should be admired .
just like cobwebs .
from or going down to the boathouse .
i dont know , she admitted .
and it all fitted init fitted in like magic .
can you , parker ?
the evening passed rapidly .
it brings things back to them .
here in this house where i had been sent , clotilde , lavinia , anthea .
i , too , jumped out , and caught poirot by the arm .
i saw three more , but they all despised me .
he drew attention , remember , to the curious incident of the dog in the nighttime - and the answer
tell me about the willetts , said emily .
i do not believe that anyone could be so monstrous as to accuse me of what you say .
you were being made the victim of a couple of clever jewel thieves .
you mean he is here now ?
no threatening letter ?
repeat ad lib .
a river and then back to the coast with its hundreds of little sandy coves .
i havent got any conscience , to speak of .
but i am more than that now .
she was so upset .
nick gave a sudden little shiver .
you know how in these quiet country places everything gets so exaggerated and servants do pass things on .
no , unless hattie has changed very much , she is not homicidal !
but when , leaning out of my bedroom window , i reported that the man in question was strolling about
fournier took the telephone .
did she take her young man with her ?
i look at it like this , he said after a minute or two .
sir stanley digby went up to town early this morning , didnt he , he said .
edna went crimson with pleasure and went out marvelling nevertheless at what some people liked .
i seeyes , i see .
i am mrs .
her voice held a kind of childish bewilderment .
we dont know how that shadow is going to affect our lives .
they dont lock you out , i hope ?
and they told meabout fatherthat hes dead .
monsieur poirot she began .
he tells you what its necessary for you to know .
meynell had said .
not _num_ .
seizing her opportunity , she opened the door a little way .
i can promise you that there will be no recurrence of this business .
worlds in a funny way nowadays , said colonel atkinson .
its broken him up completely , frobisher spoke shortly .
you seem to be always going to coffee mornings .
he dropped down at the other end of the stone bench .
he cant have expected shed have any cash or stuff to speak of , and there must have been times
before recent taxation , were in comfortable circumstances .
they proceeded amicably back to the hotel .
the paper says so .
and then he stiffened suddenly , all his senses on the alert .
hes been plunging heavily and mixing himself up in some rather undesirable ventures .
thanks , he said laconically .
he made a suitable pause , then began to read : this is the last will and testament of magdala
yes , i am sure she was an italian who came from pisa .
a sheet of paper was there , with words scrawled in an unformed childish hand .
she spoke little , treating us to a faraway wrapped-up-in-higher-things mood .
no , mr boynton came first .
was not called upon to assume a role unfamiliar to me .
married ?
he seemed to have been very fond of her .
i had my glasses out , and thats how i happened to see miss cram (if it was miss cram
she is my oldest friend .
what ought i to do , lady frances ?
we know that they all have ways of maintaining contact with each other , and with the different branches of

it is grievous to admit it , but we have made a mistake .
look at our norwegian friend .
lord edgwares suggestion was adopted .
as i was saying , i came back to the hotel and made some inquiries about miss pettigrew .
yes , i suppose its the heat .
you remember me ?
poirot , hattie is not mentally deficient , but she is what country folk describe as simple .
she clasped her hands in a sudden anguish .
the good brother didnt like it , remember ?
made out .
i go and do it now .
actor ?
your remaining here ties up with the old manor house .
he turned back to her and stared .
you saw that , did you ?
it is rather a lonely spot , agreed mr .
at last he found the missive , and handed it to poirot .
carrying a large tartan bag .
a present to his dear little daughter , duly bought and paid for .
an ideal little tool , i fear .
that means you know what i want to say .
george to my friends .
the angle of approach would be quite different .
i have read ityesit is in the newspaper !
riviera ?
time doesnt mean anything out here .
with an apologetic cough , angell answered him .
i want the truth !
i suppose not , said anthony regretfully .
then she went slowly up to annette .
seems he knew ruby keene .
or miss chilcott .
hoskins .
is that the only reason ?
she was absolutely like a ghost of her former self .
seventy at least , perhaps older .
youre looking well , too .
patriotism or ruthless requisitioning had swept these away .
a very just observation , said mr .
lacey you would see it at its best .
the bullet just missed the taller girl by an inch .
i know the things you would say .
you were in low water financially .

in the meantime i put this point to you .

what do they think there is in it for them ?
the whole thing was done not only on a comfortable but on a luxurious basis .
he caught frantically with both hands to a projection in the wall beside him .
why thursday ?
tommy brought her the hundred pound note she asked for .
and i was so excited .
i had fixed september _num_ th as the date of lady carmichaels removal .
he stopped dead , thumping himself on the chest .
and left it ready with the porter .
ella was conscientious , industrious and dull .

if it had not been so painful , it would have been quite an interesting physical phenomenon .
we both longed to make plans for the future , but both felt it was better not .
you cant expect her to feel the same age as julia upjohn , for instance .
a good many people , i should think .
bantry looked out of one of the landing windows .
i know , of course that i cannot hope to make you believe me , but i assure you that
they miss the awful gilchrist , i suppose , said rosamund .
i cannot , i know , escape the penalty for what i have done .

a peaceful afternoon , mr .

he wondered rather idly what she had wanted to say .
one from sweden sold last year for fourteen thousand three hundred pounds .
one should be safe from it by the end of september !
and so ona lot more .
and forty miles to go .
anthony looked with some interest , not troubling to fulfil the latter part of the command .
the house was mortgaged .
(forgive me , mr .
but anonymous letters are written by women rather than by men .
she rang off .
yes , i believe they were at it yesterday afternoon .
what did sir eustace do with the cases ?
and i did pass the remark to elsie , downstairs , that it was funny somebody having a bath round
i found what i was looking for .
computers ?
have you felt yourself that something waswrong ?
listening at doors , and running to the police with stories about blackmail .
the latter had just finished reading the wire received from the swiss police .
katherine looked at him with a troubled face .
sir edwin resumed : you say this is from a tube of apomorphine hydrochloride ?
her eyes were round and agog with excitement .
yes , well have to look into that alibi .
hoffman moved his shoulders .
i cant say that hes ever been my favourite patient , but he is my patient , and im damned

they have been pressed too far .

no , waterlily .
when the two men had departed , hastings rose from the settee and approached poirot , bursting with suppressed excitement
theres not much time and i have to read my book .
i could not have told you which exact words i used .
that was the same as usual .
onslow square , isnt it ?
he was in his bedroom at chimneys .
what a strange thing to say !
you dont only think you know who did it , you actually do know .
george lomax ?
rien ne va plus , said the croupier .
he returned after a brief interval .
from (apparently) the coast of africa to do so .
i am a police officer , and i have a warrant to search this house .
a journey into the strange places of the human soul .
recognizing that aristocratic nobleman , and he frowned angrily .

you will guide her destinies with a strong , sure hand .
sometimes happily , sometimes disastrously , but seldom permanently .
' cocky little devil , aren ' t you ?
he wanted money and he took a risk .
farmer raikes has got a very pretty young wife .
trying on expensive black clothes with a serious absorbed face .
she wasnt at all like her father .
throwing his colleague a glance of mild reproof , poirot turned again to tredwell .
vraiment , cest impossible , she said .
he told me beforehand that he meant to do it .
inconvenient personthe wife !
where did you say the body was found ?
rathbone , she said .
we were now entering the high street .
she said after a minute or two : any news in the evening paper ?
but what does that matter ?
it puts you in your place .
such often have the most violent feelings .
i didnt do it .
i can tell you , m .

as she took part in their game , the vague ache in her heart lessened .
superintendent battle spun round in his chair and stared at her in amazement .

i telephoned through to the doctor , which nobody seemed to have thought of doing .

parker pyne rose to meet him with a beaming smile .

he had a way with woman , poirot added dryly , without looking at lynn who flushed .

mr carlile was busy arranging some papers in a file by the safe .

you are very naughty , sir henry .
he had thought to have convinced herbut evidently she had preferred her own judgement .
and the devil of it is , i cant go after him .
she began to dial , but then stopped and replaced the receiver again .
what did he say percival had done ?

he pointed out the crooks .
and you cant give me anything nearer than that , mr .
that conversation between crale and meredith blake is more intelligible now .
poirot continued dreamily .
somebody told you about it .
very nice , thank you .
he was in his dressing gown and slippers .
he added , hes very handsome , isnt he ?
here comes mrs .
there is nothing wrong about this place , inspector .
as they lifted him cornelia appeared in the doorway .
he looked merely uninterested .
louise , as the assembled company , go and look for yourselves .
he knows it , too .
miss murgatroyd skipped nimbly sideways .
then he shoved a cable form under poirots nose .
she was a thin , gaunt woman with neat grey hair parted in the middle , very staid and calm

i am very glad .

from the door .
but lawson had a revolver ?
swim suits of course , sports paraphernalia .

you were the injured party ?
here in london ?
and anyway , if eliza did want to make a change , she ' d never have gone off this

all later events seem to have been wiped out .
and then one used to stop listening and just say yes and really ?

thank you , said battle .
all the same i think you are assuming too much .
from now on i occupy myself of everything .
grange said heavily : theres something in the atmosphere hereit gets you all tangled up !
but i have got to make sure , shall we say , that it doesnt .
the great quartetteflora and faunawhat luck have you had todayeh ?
jeremy came in , attempting rather unsuccessfully to look completely at his ease .
i have , to begin with , an incurably romantic imagination .
it ought to be all sunlight .
i dont know anything about those things , but i should say that yes , said poirot encouragingly .
but it doesnt square with what she was overheard to say .
a tight-lipped man who did not trouble to conceal his profound distrust of politicians .
she got up and went over to the writing desk .
anywell , permanent shadow .
subdue your so beautiful and honest nature and sit down .
thats a change of mind from last night , if so , i said slowly .
, that hope was quickly quenched .
he then did various things with ropes .
yes , eleanor vansittart washow shall i put it ?
he got it in the neck from another source .

he found it less open to new ideas , more hidebound by tradition than its great and powerful rival .

poirot threw me a glance of reproof .
porrotta name which conveys an odd feeling of unreality .
ive not denied that i was there .
i must admit that it gave me rather a shock to run into parker just outside the door .
now you cannot escape .
oliver , i dont think ive ever met him .
this is yours , miss van schuyler ?
very delicately indeed !
all that kind of thing .
if youre going to marry , dont leave it too late .

hardly thirty seconds passed before jackson appeared through the connecting door to the adjoining room .
jackson will do what you tell him , wont he ?
ive always wanted one .
protheroe , we know the motive .
any case , so she persuaded herself , would only be marrying george for his money .
she looked very happy and busy .
he went back home and two days later hed done in someone else .
did he get up , or leave the desk , after reading the will and before signing it ?
kay had flung herself down on her bed .
you must , surely , have had some suspicion .
cornelia has always been a nice handy girl , willing to run errands , and not so selfish as some
if so , the second occupant of the room could have escaped through the door .
i doubt it , said poirot .
d ' you think i ' d lend myself to such tomfoolery ?
ginevra will come to paris and enter one of my clinics .
just a mite impatient to leave us , commented julius , as the car gathered way again .
thomas smiled and murmured : in the mayang straits !

superintendent battle shrugged his burly shoulders and became evasive .

youve followed up more wildcat trails than anyone i know .
oh , really , miss peake .

the usual pause happened .
you will agree that i shall not be far from the truth if i recall captain black and ask him

he returned his gaze to poirot .
he went into the house and returned shortly afterwards carrying two large glass mugs .
she kept telling me it had been nothing to do with me .
poirot looked from one to the other .
but these werent written at the timethey werent written until six months afterwards .
silently poirot displayed the title .

perhaps she threw them out of the window to someone .
the question was clearly unexpected .
cornelia robson , youre the only nice woman ive ever come across .

tuppence gave an exclamation and handed a letter across to tommy .
right , think i will turn in .
not at the time , if you understand , she added .
i think you have no idea .

our voices rose .
aarons , temperament !
the word was not one that he would naturally have associated with gervase chevenix-gore .
a tentative inquiry from japp produced miss sainsbury seales whole life history .
nothing so crude as that .
now , snell , im going to ask you a rather important question .
she glanced up at the sky .
ive had enough of schools to last me for a lifetime .
has led far too blameless a life to have been blackmailed .
dumbfounded , i took the wire to japp .
inspector campbell wondered why it was interesting .
as she picked up the tray he asked fretfully : whos that on the telephone ?
afterward she said he gave her a funny feeling .
we all had motives , said lynn .
satterthwaite noted the girls companion , a dark young man , not handsome , but with a suggestion of restless

but no one knew about them except us .
i have cut myself down to a tiny dose .
pennington didnt do it .
but well get her in a worse mess if we keep on with this , hugo insisted .

it was all very tactful and well arranged .

i realize very well what you are suggesting .
his affections went to her sister .
she shook her head , moistening her lips , seeking for words that would not come .
he took too many maybe .
everything about bess sedgwick was positive .
anything she says to be depended upon or otherwise ?
because were all new i suppose .
ah , now it comes to you , does it not ?
what will the people in the other flats think ?
some sound had woken me , and as i sat up in bed listening i heard it again .
whether it was the events of the night , or whether it was something in dakins personality (victoria thought afterwards

she paid a final visit to messrs .
now darling , about the play tonight .

le boulanger .
i knew something was going to happen , and actually they had not felt anything of the kind .
i looked up at him suddenly .

he paused , then added , as it happens , theres a slight fog in london .
he came in while i was having my breakfast , and he acted very oddly .
journeys end , hearts delight and names like boarding-houses .
why , miss marple , im so delighted youve come to stay with us for a while .

lorrimer has committed suicide ?
he can start at once .
and giles simply loves detective stories , said gwenda .
then she got out and the man seeing her gave an astonished shout .

poirot recognized the latter at once .

sellon , so the inspector tells us , was questioned once or twice by the narcotics squad .
upward once or twice but there was no answer .

the manager shrugged his shoulders .
i dont think it is altogether about lily .

hilary had a few things with her supplied at the hospital .

there is the evidence of the nail .
the route was , as usual , through a maze of winding corridors .
the other nodded vigorously .
so that is the explanation of the blank label on the box , i remarked .

ive not got it clear yet just that real safety could only be achieved one way .
henet came running out from the porch .

it was very exciting to her thus to be sharing an intimate meal with a celebrity .
we had black coffee and hot buttered toast , finished rhoda in a triumphant burst .

he searched among the papers on the table , and finally handed the one he was in search of to

i lowered her gently to the pavement and sat her with her back against the iron railings .
i was quite sure i could bring the old boy downget him in the leg .
i had better go .
well , there was a bit of fuss when it came to probating , or whatever you call it ,

she disappeared from here and shes never been heard anymore of .

unceremoniously i yanked her to her feet .
but nothing happens .
a recherch meal , affectionate reminiscences , and a hurried and affectionate good-bye .
when the women came in we all looked across the room , he had the stropanthin ready , he dropped
with exuberant hair and a pink and white face , peered round it .

satterthwaite recited the main points of the tragedy .

well , hes out of it all nowadays .
ive got plenty of hobbies .
he had by far the strongest motive .
dont mind my bark .
he seemed to deliberate as to whether to pursue the subject .
all right if theyre given on prescription , but there are too many of them you can get without prescription
if it must all come out , cant you lay the blame upon me and me only ?
if that is true it clears the ground considerably .
poirot any questions to ask ?
the small fry .
he continued to talk .
but it is an idea , that !
fourteen victoria lay in bed with her light out , listening through the darkness .
poirot moved swiftly over to her .

_num_ he has admitted that at that moment he was seriously worried .

and that reason ?
he had been in the diplomatic service for a time , but when he inherited ainswick he had resigned and
she ' d been ten years in her last place .
tommy nodded seriously enough .

his tone was quietly encouraging .
no , indeed , sir , he was one of the last off the boat .

incurably romantic , he suggested again that there was , somewhere , some woman .

i should be very grateful if you could .
i would have been happy to have given him any professional knowledge that might be useful to him , but
the hint of a threat was not lost upon him , but he interpreted it in his own way .

he was improving , improving very much .
yesterday , for the first time , she had seen her in the flesh .
how could he know , even ?
why this insidious lurking suspicion that nofret and kameni had been closer friends than had appeared on the surface ?
he picked up her handbag .

the place was lighted by a lamp , but it was empty .
you look all in .
the funeral was to be on the following day .
and elsie had to depart with her curiosity unsatisfied .
theres nothing much to mine .
' _num_ ' i understand , ' said poirot , ' that mr gascoigne refused absolutely ?
anthony sighed .

he hardly ever speaks now .
aloud he said , as nevile did not answer , well , mr .
on the other hand , prussic acid is more dramatic and is pretty certain to do the trick .

that handkerchief is not mine .
bantry would have rung me up then unless it was for some particular reason , said miss marple thoughtfully .
a cliff because he wouldnt tamper with the truth !
someone persuaded him or bribed himto identify the dead man as underhay ?
hell never know , said julius .
at least she asked me to get them for her .
the whole point of a good detective story was that it must be somebody obvious but at the same time
not that i know of , said mary .
what on earth do you mean by that ?
and suddenly a baleful idea shot across my mind .
betterton was shown in .
i hoped i should .
gulbrandsen seemed very concerned about mrs .
surely these things dont happen , he murmured .
he greeted dermot craddock with pleasure and curiosity .
nadina laughed softly .
the older and deafer did not look up .
one thing our mentor did not warn me about was that if you did not get spots of water paint
king , her name is , winnie king .
she had to admitand she didnt like admittingthat her mother had been right .
hes very cleverbrilliant really , but i must admit that he sometimes has a very unfortunate manner .
breakfast was served in pre-war fashion .
here you arelook .
in a book , i mean , she added apologetically .
thats more difficult , said tuppence , but i think one can get round to it .
of course running a place like this means a lot of worries , and she is quite inexperienced .
thomas , major horton and hetty jones , a giggling young woman who was the daughter of the bank manager
and , after all , i have been guilty of taking up your time for nothing .
ive always been so afraid , you know , that these young people would be bored by our christmas here
at the same moment a dim figure came forward from the back of the room where he had been sitting
downstairs .
was he afraid , do you think , that she was contemplating some further rash act ?
i came upstairs after dinner to fetch my pearls for mr .
as the car finally drove off , the squadron leader looked after it , wondering to himself why on earth
she ran across the lawn .
he was irritating , of course .
a terrified look swept across mrs .
at that moment , the master himself came out of the great fold and , emboldened by his benignant smile
you have come to me to ask me something ?
read it aloud if you like , said tuppence .
in thwarting their expectations !
out of the way , since i was the next heir to the throne .
so pongo was cleared , as you say .
what do you mean by sneaking up on me in that way and making me jump ?
superintendent sugden was sent for by the dead man ; a robbery was reported to him , and he was
the other young woman , who had a royal blue headscarf , said brightly : please ?
the case is solvedlabelled and put away as suicide .
not giving anything away , is he ?

com hercule poirot ' s casebook agatha christie is known throughout the world as the queen of crime .
i left him with them .
poirot says , there isnt such a thing as a murderer who commits crimes at random .
for my sermons are dull and scholarly .
charles went about it all efficiently and methodically , to the accompaniment of an undercurrent of his own thoughts .
dont mean the police , but the people that are right in it .
it is the silent dead in whom i am usually interested .
the launch chugged down the river below gulls point , and then swung round into the little bay that divided

they all stood talking just by the post office for a few minutes , then mrs .
for colonel luttrell would have been quite as certain as everyone else that it was he who had fired the

i have only done so for a short time .
the sick man was very much better than he had been for some days , and his wife flatly denied

or giuseppe ?
abroad , take a thorough rest and get some distraction .
as though , already , she guessed .
in actual fact this meant that inspector neeles mind was racing once more round an imaginary track .
the superintendent seemed rather pleased than otherwise .
this gentleman is the doctor who examined the body .
forgetting my presence they both dropped into french , and i left them together and went back into the living
springer might have talked about the key incident .
his manner was courteous in the extreme .
i want to help .
' my little friend smiled .
called out harry , in a ringing voice .
very well she did it , too !
angell was the next to appear .
it wouldntto you .
why shouldnt i say twenty-five past five ?
frobisher said , and his voice , too , was broken : hes a man .
the room gave on the sea and was full of sunshine .
that room had been her husbands dressing room .
erparrotandercaptain hawkins .
with a diabolical smile he laid traps for us .
ten to one shes left a letter confessing everything .
enderby dubiously .
she might have seen or heard something .
' lord mayfield ' s colour rose a little .
then poirot said : financially , that did not benefit her ?
bessners and mademoiselle de belleforts cabins are all on the port side .
not a minute too soon .
punctuality and economy .
went on colonel melchett .
i did not answer directly .
but , mind you , she would have had him anyway .
he has in his hands , poised and ready , a heavy quern .
still it was always as well to be prepared .
they gave prizes for them .
somebody said as he is the kind of dog they used to keep for rats .
you were looking for something , werent you , in the desk there ?
anyway lets say something that a child would be excited to find .
tell me , said poirot , what was your husband like ?
said miss bennett with an interrogative inflection .
it was the way my mum wanted !
its not a policeman i wanti can look after myself , thank youits certainty i want .
but i can give you his secretarys telephone number .
hes been a slippery customer , i can tell you .
miss marvells .
why dont you buy it ?
they occupied it .
they went about a lot together .
he looked curiously round the dingy room .
her baptismal name of diana , handed the gazette across the table .
she was an old-fashioned type , i said .
that means that ive forgotten to go to lunch with some people for the third time .
ah , yes , servants are not always too particular about that .
the two police officers knew every fact that was to be known about the room where the crime had been
no , he said , there is no proof .
under what circumstances can raymond be guilty ?
heres a separate lot of people prepared to swear a woman was in two different places at the same time
everyone likes him .
there are going to be more deaths , yahmose .
you are quite sure of that , my dear ?
supposing that before the war clapperton was a ventriloquist .
from the end of the terrace gina called : you ought to come in , grandam .
craddock .
a lot of people seem to be out for your blood , uncle alistair !
bunch frowned .
i shouldnt think well get any lunch .
he had heard of this formula that sir claud had invented .
it was never any use asking mr .
: ah !
well , thats what she said .
he always lookedwell , very neat .
he allowed himself to be led forth from the house and hurried down the drive to the waiting car .
and then when we came in here and found there had been a robbery , it seemed as though mayfield
he never worried me or got in my way .
urging his claims upon her mistress .
you shout , you run , it is a matter of speed .
im afraid , he said apologetically , it is a pretty nasty one .
these gentlemen are police officers , i think .

eh bien , the pompon that was missing had not been wrenched off , as the lady said .
table and play with exciting wads of moneyto give partieswild , absurd , extravagant partiesi want everything thats going in
hes got a new rolls-royce car , said tuppence with vicarious pride .
we left the hotel at two oclock and got back here somewhere around half past , i should say .
besides , i thought i heard a cry .
by events .
every afternoon .
she would also inherit her money when she died .
they know that the island was bought by a man called owenand thats about all they do know .

he was white to the lips , as though in deadly terror .
and she say i will show youand then she say , at a quarter past six , and i think

im glad youve come , m .
he strode out angrily .
what tune was it ?
if you know what genes are i know , more or less , said miss marple .
helen and my father felt they were alikeand there was me to be looked after , and she thought she
if ever again he should dream of the house , segrave knew he would awake at once with a start
that went unanswered while he read twice over a small insignificant paragraph in the morning paper .
there was no doubt about it .
she started by saying carelessly : what was that mans name you mentioned last night ?
detective constable waite looked at his superior officer with awe .
meet her here and shot her .
she inquired casually .
it must have been dreadfully difficult .
she had been staying then at a hotel near russell square .
ignored !

consideration of the handsome fringed parrot tulips , and some tulips called , as far as tuppence could make out

the afternoon post had just been delivered .
yes , sir , regular upset so nervous she didnt seem to know what she was saying .
i see him now and again on the links .

human nature is simply fascinating .

hes been out ever since the beginning , five years ago .
always giving you messages from one or other of your relationsand always totally incongruous ones .
theyve been quite all right .
oh , her ?
the inspector was looking perplexed .
took from his pocket a kodak photographic folder .
that upset poor gladys quite a lot .
failing to be put on his guard .
the present is apt to beparochial .
you may laugh , but i shall tell you the whole thing .

she died a few years ago .
sounds pretty sordid to you , i expect , but you know there was an attraction about itmainly the risk
but they were too much of gentlemen to want to go into the business .
the matter together .
she felt instinctively that it would be much better if by tomorrow she was somewhere else .
chah !
my friend therehe will tell you .
my dear griselda , i said , surprised .
i cant get free .
presently richard baker and mrs .
poirot was busy on his own account .
lady cynthia laughed with him .
no , i think were a good deal safer to stick to mrs .
after all , she would soon know all there was to be known .
thats understood .
protheroe came to the door to meet him , and then they both went inside .
snow on the deserts facethat is the title of my new book .
pas du tout , said poirot briskly .
entwhistle was greatly upset by the death of his old friend , mr .

he said abruptly : did you see her take it ?
yes , philip had been too vehementtoo biased .
making her will ?
but seeing that the master is dead .
rhodes had been staying at the crown hotel in barnchester .
she returned with the elderly maid who had opened the door to them earlier .
i think she is quite dependable , i said cautiously .
often said she wished she could die .
died !
was a vast grill at which officiated chefs dressed as devils with tails and horns .
said mr bonnington complacently .
possibly accountants or financiers ; one or two army officers in plain clothes .
ridiculous .
iris was startled for a moment out of her apathy .
she began to talk to henrietta with something like animation .
to me was would you like to see a snapshot of a murderer ?
yesi did see him .
a horrible thought flashed across me .
it ought to have been the other way round .
he walked round the room looking inside ornaments , went into the adjoining bathroom from whence he presently returned .
was she one of the family ?
elise lifted the lid and took out an old-fashioned alpaca dress with a silk underskirt .
i dont think it could have anything to do with it .
a car came for her this morningoh , about half past eleven i should think , and she drove off
door was locked on the inside .
miss burgess gave herself up to calculation .
she said : after all , henry , girls do fall in love .
she lookedshe lookedafraid .
ferrars in her letter mentioned a personshe didnt actually specify a man .
mademoiselle , said poirot .
i was walking up and down smoking in front of the drawing room window .
i suppose i shall get over it some day and eat them again , butwell , i dont like the
rival , all the way down in the train .
then what do you mean ?
i should have thought myself that it would not have been a bad plan , observed knighton .
right in her assumption that she herself had committed a murder .
if simeon lee had died before her mother , her mothers share would have come down to her (unless her
i was astounded .
she had poured out words eagerly , rather incoherently , and his heart had warmed to her .
she screamed .

tonight is the anniversary of the day we first met .
then he said : i was about to order some coffee .
morleys death ?
dear , said mrs .
for it is the cause of science .
punctual to the minute , out came felicie with a stump of candle in her hand .
there werent any lights showing in the living room .
miss waynflete returned at that minute .
very much of the grenadier , agreed sir charles .
i went to london .
on the other side of it was a door , half ajar .
or if he does tell you , what he says wont be true .
george waved the kidney aside impatiently .
he raised his hand and struck her a flat blow on the cheek .
and everyone will say yesand then one of two things will happen .
we were just good friends with a bit of flirtation thrown in .
and now , lady eileen , im going to introduce you .
whats she eaten ?
and so , to save the man she loved , she tried to destroy the evidence against him .
you have to take the rough with the smooth .
very strong glasses .
shes nearly eighty , of course .
i suppose i must .
it swung slowly open and for a minute or two that was all .
the contents of drawers and cupboards were strewn all over the floor .
i pretended to be old ebs son .
someone substituted eserine eyedrops for insulin .
and dobbs ?
im only a justice of the peace , he said .
why dont you ask her ?
you see , she called at my flat yesterday but i was out .
riding master , and the sister got him .
the girl said suddenly and scornfully : i should think youd come across thieves often enough !
the woman was obviously startled , and the flash of alarm that flitted across her face was not lost on
you want to be sure he actually sails !
then i tiptoed noiselessly to the door .
and it will begin long before he gets to exhampton .
and this particular evening it was like other evenings there ?
she got up and moved towards the door , and poirot said : i will walk back with you ,
murgatroyd must be turned off like a tap .
this was to her natural and proper ; she was saving up for her dot , that precious sum of

in the pitch darkness of the night , the thief had found it easy to make his getaway .
but i used to do watercolours myself as a girl and i heard a lot of talk about painting and
youll keep it to yourself ?
we had a ridiculous conversation that there seems not much point in writing down here .

he adored father .
carters warnings passed unheeded .
(why is it that anybody who was a kitchen maid or an ugly old peasant never seems to get reincarnated
of course , i couldnt tell them where hed gone to , but they got on his track all right
he was looking at you like a hungry bloodhound most of the afternoon .
you do not understand human nature , mr .
and then she shouts after me as though she thinks i was meaning to steal it .
what did you say the address was ?
it was not until after everyone had gone that i discovered the safe rifled !
bit of news we got this morning upset her .
i said to elsa when we were on the way back : i asked amyas what you meant when you

cuff links ?
still staring at him , she murmured very softly : how odd .
and she was full of funmost amusing little thing .
turn the gas on and stuff up all the cracks and just go to bed .
weak-headed , boastful , a liaryet a certain pleasant simplicity about him .
good lord , i said , you startled me , mum .
miss lemon replied sadly that servants did not seem to know what elbow grease was nowadays .
poirot said slowly : i intend , hastings , to be very careful in what i say .
the only thing ive ever noticed about the news that they print is that its a tissue of lies from

it is true that , in some ways , he is more in the picture than madame .
or pestering her .

where have we got to ?
only i dont really mean a real antique shop .
he picked it up , the charred relic , and manipulated it with pride .
shes a bit nervy but thats all , and elaine is one of those queer , tempestuous , tense girls
im a bit worried about her , said bletchley .
what the next move will be , i do not know .
his first proceeding on re-entering the house was to ask parsons where miss margrave might be found .
tonight i was of necessity preaching extempore , and as i looked down on the sea of upturned faces ,
planned .
shes got a queer but rather exciting face and when she reads bits of shakespeare it all seems different and

not dead .
everything is perfectly normal .

she teaches mathematics and is rather fussy , but quite nice .
i tried hard for martha or dorcas or something sensiblebut it was no goodwaste of breath .
once it was a dividend warrant to her bank and no one could think where it had got to ,
to be the focal point of a womans appearance , her hair .

crying hysterically , swept away by intense emotion .
boy at the door , said albert .
they rolled it over .
i put some rather unusual things in it this time .
anthony marstons spirits cheered up a little .
for what else can it be but that ?
you see , very few christian names are given .
i think you could , said lynn .
she was staring straight at micky .
as things stand at present , said kettering slowly , it would .
how can it matter by what plane one arrives at casablanca .
he said he was in a hurry .
better stick to the willett girl .
he had bowed his head , then crossed and put the telegram into her outstretched hand .
certainly there was no longer the old incentive .
luke stared ahead of him .
its dreadful , said miss johnson , its really dreadful .
as a matter of fact he was seeing something that caused him far more apprehension than any ghost could have
a few days , might be of inestimable advantage .
how far away ?
go away and leave me alone .
harolds fairly orthodox , not what i call a very pleasant character , coldhearted , eye to the main chance
henden appeared at the door .

kettering shrugged his shoulders .

all these things i asked myself .
when we get hold of those two much valuable time may have been lost , broke in poirot .
poirot , i really am disappointed with you .
claire rose suddenly , pushing back her chair so abruptly that it overturned and fell to the ground .
messieurs , mesdames , i have called you together for a certain purpose .

he drew out his wallet and started hunting through it .
he was quite sure that he was on the right track .
with an entirely new system of plumbing installed .
its really very secret , henry reiterated .
, thereby making sure that medical aid would not reach her until too late .
bouc said solemnly .
i dont mean we can walk out the day after tomorrow , olive .

certainly , major riddle .
it is not permitted that i take the car through these gates .
good evening , nurse , hows your patient ?
poor simon clode was inconsolable .

who can identify dr .
he was dreadfully lonely .
anthony took up his hat and stick again and prepared to depart .
her accident ?
i cant make it out .
the nook , surrey road , wimbledon .
i must impress upon you again that you are in very grave danger , and that the utmost frankness is
but , you see , i didnt know about her anymore .
sprot appeared and betty was led off to be attired for her walk .
nothing has upset me , said miss marple .
the husband , naturally , would be the first to be deceived .
bland seemed in very good form .
sergeant trotter was looking flushed and energetic .
by the way , rogers , he said casually .
he ought to have been back hours ago .

i wonder why she did it .

it appears he was painting lettice in her bathing dress .
quin merely shook his head .
she came in without me hearing this morning and bawled me out for snooping .
where is the girl , by the way ?
footing getting on to the quay and fallen in the river .
but everyone thought that mrs .
mary spoke in a loud harsh voice .
nothing , it appeared , was easier than just to step into the british consulate .
i really think you must be mad .
theyre not allowed to stay longer than a couple of nightsthen theyve got to move on .
haymesyes , out there in the summerhouseall you say is that i make it up !
lane stretched up , but he could not quite reach to the back of the shelf .
its true im only just beginning to know how true it is but believe me , m .
it must have been sheer instinct .
and the lady continued : used to be a great disciplinarian in his regiment , so he told me .
a very funny expression came over joannas face .
very well , if you say so , he remarked grudgingly .
and the things hes done to it must have cost him a fortune .
and remember thiswe must start again from the beginning , since our first conception was entirely wrong .
then here it is .
you and your husband have done a very remarkable piece of work , mrs .
fired .
yes , felicie , i am going now .
when they had reached the centre of the garden , mr .
but wealth still has its temples , madame .
i dont think iwant to know .
they could have written it in longhand .
she was quite clearly a pleasant , but slightly stupid woman .
i settled her comfortably by the dining room table , and hurried off again to telephone .
this way please .
if so , she might think it better to mention it in a casual fashion .
an exceedingly handsome girl .
of course , the girl iris , rosemarys sister , she had been there .
sallys mouth curved up in a wide catlike grin .
and an ample amount of the drug was recovered .
we know nothing about you .
i suppose youll have to stick to your moustache , said frankie .
i ran away back to my room and locked the door .
his description of the abbey , of the servants , of the chief constable was admirable .

ive had a thundering good time .
jimmy , he said , youve got brains .
it is melodrama stirred up with a stick .
grange said sharply : yes , sir ?
a small man .

he arrived at _num_ : _num_ at warmsley heath station .
she led the way upstairs and poirot followed her .

the sports pavilion is some distance away and i rather doubt if the shot would be noticeable .
pauncefoot jones was out in the courtyard with the foreman .
sure that when he last saw him , morley was alive .
i had no means of judging her capability in any way .
rudd , he said , does not see anybody without an appointment , madam .
susan offered mr .

it is a waste .
magda leonides could spill a mouthful if she chose .
her lips fell apart ; a look of bewilderment came into her eyes .
i was told in strict confidence , said the vicar .
my mother had bad heart attacks since my fathers death .
was smiling to himself .
and so she had the stage setall nicely arranged for suicide no .

ginger nodded twice emphatically and then spoke .
theres a sort of feeling she waved her handswould you like a kipper ?
she mightnt have agreed with you there , said chief-inspector davy .
but whether he felt it or not , there is such a sensation .
considerable surprise has been created .

he bent over frederica .
so she opened the door and i took the tray in and put it on the table .

from the shelter of a convenient caf , we sipped coffee and watched the entrance of the hotel .
yes , surely she was getting on .
said the great man .
unlike me , she never read fairy stories as a child .

johnson withdrew .
they themselves would not know which .
they both recovered themselves , and the man muttered an apology , his eyes scanning anthonys face narrowly .

frankie explained in a few rapid words .
albert went to the side door .
pender , what are you going to tell us ?

they met his quite steadily and he wondered if his momentary suspicion had been unjust .
stranges in the house ?
thomasina tuckertons home had been somewhere in surrey .

protheroe said she was calling for her husband at the vicarage so that they could go home together .

it would be fatal if any hint of who you are got about .

the happiness of one man and woman is the greatest thing in all the world .
yes , i daresay she could be , said tuppence .
poirot frowned .
he thinks it preposterous !
it would be bitter indeed for you to have your wife dragged into an unpleasant police case .

poirot sat up and switched on the light .
very quiet , though .
the silence was broken with a long , shuddering sigh .
that poirot had given the maid .
i will pass over the next stages quickly .
newman shook his head .

she explained her desire for a post in the neighbourhood so as to be near her aunt .

henrietta said to gerda : what fun actresses are .
ah , nought but trouble and funerals lately , it seems .
desmond just came rushing into the house .
dr gerard said gravely : he is not a fool at all .
yes , monsieur , but poirot leaned forward .
quite often he did not understand what you said to him , and when everyone was speaking more or less
and now , he said , for the impertinence .
so you know all about it ?
thats a striking-looking man , i thought .

luttrell pounced upon us and suggested bridge .

satterthwaite glanced at him .
i put it down to her terrible distress over her friend .
you have found nothing ?
four people are under suspicion and one of them must have done it .
i listened for a minute or two , then replied briefly .
yes , she seemed much as usual .
and then he said : see she gets home all right , wont you ?
he looked shrewdly at colonel munro .
two an appeal for help it was five minutes past nine when i entered our joint sitting room for breakfast
the spokesman was the elder of the two , a grey-haired , pompous gentleman who spoke excellent english .
he couldnt see any possibility of the police or anyone else finding out if that was what she had done
do you really believe that mrs .
fournier sank in his seat discouraged , and was but little cheered by observing poirots open amusement .
half-past ?
theyve no idea at all of hygiene in these countries .
i would agree that the embroidering of victorian cushion-covers is not equal to participating in the bayeux tapestry , but
poirot continued , i have occupied myself of late in reading various real life unsolved mysteries .
i dont know what you think , but i havent the least doubt who did it .
he said : its damned oddno getting over it .
colonel bantry glanced at her uneasily .
yes , im sure thats how it was .
did anybody think there had been anything wrong about mrs .
armstrong has disappeared (drowned) .
and a new sinksteel she interrupted .
but she was only gone a minute did she have her gloves on , or in her hand when she
then he came across esther walters and he saw a nice prospect of more money .
probably a wild-goose chase , said fournier as they left the shop .
he said brusquely : no , a man doesnt die of a mere choking fit .
pointz corrected mr .
she did say that he had got very old i think she said senile .
she inserted a gibe herea prick there .
you hadnt the least idea what , bessie ?

it didnt occur to you or audrey whether i should think it a marvellous idea ?
i will take it away and get you some hot .
inside it , wedged in cotton wool , was a small mirror .
as it is weve nothing against farraday at all .
but nothing important that i can remember , nothing that joyce took an interest in or anything of that kind
i shant pay seven guineas for this kind of thing .

she said with emphasis : its incredible to mequite incrediblethat my brother should have committed suicide !

they arouse no interest or speculation .
i looked over the catalogue at breakfast .

and i actually remember his mentioning one stampan eighteen fifty-one blue two-cent .

but poirot was not to be drawn .
can i have a word with you , please ?
' ' you see what i ' m driving at ?
rafiel softly .
once she was dead and the diamonds were in my possession , i was safe .
as he spoke , he touched the match to something he held in his hand , and threw it down
funny how odd little things turn up to help .
tuppence found everybody extremely vague on the subject .
tommy writhed with fury .
poirot put a damper on further conversation .
redfern wanted to kill her ?
any white cocks ?
he used to make me play and sing sentimental songs to him , too .
rather dumb and sniffs , she added in an explanatory manner .
did you interfere in any way with the clock ?
will you help me ?
ive an idea it may come in useful .
i suppose , said luscombe , that the restoration was quite expensive ?
tell me what its all about ?
poirot here , whose name im very familiar with (and proud we are to have him with us , im
a lifetaken !
i assure youstraight to the truth like a homing pigeon .
the smell of gas was much stronger .
crockett has a nephew whom she is always telling us is quite the gentleman .

all those staircases and passages .
huish hardly knew himself why he was so insistent .
so you fancy you may be able to trace his identity through his connection with the stage ?
he would find a letter when he got back to his roomsexplaining , protesting , saying all the things that
crales painting .
but no , it was not .
im not disputing that for a moment .
stephen nodded thoughtfully .
it was comfortable , with deep armchairs and settees and just enough pleasant untidiness to make it livable .
yes , he said , thoughtfully , as he took it back from me .
well , i never , said henry .
youve got a cold , he said .
it was beatrice .
oh , what a fool i am !
she was pretty dumb .
but now yes , now .

he said we ought not to miss it .
i do not argue with obstinate men .

dont you think hes good-looking ?
thats a funny name , isnt it , like the thing you eat .
with all the rest of my things .
barnard and lecky .
a section of wall to the right of the shelves swung open , revealing itself to be a concealed door
but yes , but yes , it is indeed i !
but revenons nos moutons .
but a stranger might have come from outside .
most other women were wearing black , but i got it into my head that it was definitely mourningand it
it was you i chased , then ?
however , in the sense she was now thinking of it , his letter had been quite explicit .
and then the lass she screams out as it might have been blood in the basin , and i asks
inquired crome .
his secretary would do .
the murder of prince michael .
the consultation with hori would be quite private since she would send henet on an errand to the weaving sheds
for the wages , you know , and the books .
iriss eyes went over the words again and this time a phrase stood out with startling effect : .
he didnt feel that any woman was good enough .
tuppence continued rapidly : albert will be thrilled .
to throw away her dearest treasures .
in the end , the receptionists and clerks threw up their hands and looked at us in despair .
she asked where you were .
one cant blame any one else for the things one decides to do with ones eyes open .
in a minute or two he reappeared on the threshold and two more were handed to him and then again
im worried because shes worried a bit .
what madness possessed her !
behind the counter a jewa small jew with cunning eyes .
the father and mother are coming from yorkshire today .
the disfigured face .
i was very upset by this .
money in time .
you think that she i think that the fact should be noted very carefully .
it makes me feel that perhaps after all , dr .
now was that one of the cleggs she knew ?
jacqueline said : monsieur poirot means , darling , that he could swing himself over the rail and down on

raymond boynton and i separated from the others .
as you might say , mr .
always , said jason rudd .
if you and the doctor had planned together to kill mrs .
she had bade me good-bye , and i was therefore somewhat surprised to find her in this room apparently gazing
pince-nez in paris .
im terribly sorry , said bunch .
only a few of them have held any real interest .
but you observe it now ?
he would have said the things werent necessary .
six spiders webs on the cornice , miss marple noted .

it looks , said m .
whats your opinion , raglan ?
no , said tuppence , its bulbs .
so she drank it .
the sigh seemed to say .
bantry was on her knees .
it is curious , murmured poirot reminiscently , that i should have uttered a wish to work against the law
and that brings us more or less up-to-date , said father .
but you are sure , arent you ?
well , barton , if you want my advice , which i gather you do , i should think the
he realized now it was the mark where the table had been .
follow me as soon as possible to chipping somerton .
he had questioned the cook , and she had admitted that one or two of the mushrooms cooked had been
natural , so i took the opportunity of asking mr .
and it was after that that you found the rucksack ?
no one was waiting for her , nobody expected her .
her anxiety , however , was needless .
but then i wrote down _num_ , with the feeling of one who has solved a knotty point , and
seizing suitcases he hurried from the train .
no , it must have been martin wylde .
i was simply scared to death .
said blunt quickly .
although the beach was properly invisible from the club windows , the sea around the raft was not , and
and wed bought pictures too , both in italy and in paris , paying what seemed fabulous sums for them
raikes bravely saved your uncles life by springing on his assailant and preventing him from firing another shot .
he drew out a notebook .
people do sometimes try and hide that kind of thing from children .
youdid not !
rowley had said he wouldnt wait and that it was nothing that really mattered .
poirot looked at him sadly .
i felt that she had to be prevailed upon .
it was at the club .
why did a b c need to commit these murders ?
she nodded defiantly .
occasionally she closed her eyes and tried to picture mr .
not without passing through the kitchen , sir .
under the light as possible .
i have one other little matter to attend to , and then yes ?
my name is mrs .
you wait till the pictures finished and youll admit that i was right .
felicie _num_ , on the contrary , spoke italian fluently and german moderately .
yes , some twelve or thirteen years ago , i gather .
it is a likely thing as a foreigner would do , but it wouldnt be likely after all these years
nick looked rather surprised to see us .
japps voice spoke .
but it does look as though wed been had for mugs .

it is the key to the whole riddle !
it was four miles from a railway station , possessed two public houses , two small shops , a post
he looked back with his kindly , shrewd glance .
i yawned again .
is he not to them the turkey no , the goose that lays the golden eggs ?
the energetic young man had succeeded in making the lives of several scotland yard men unbearable to them , and
but if youre going to make people nice-tempered and benevolent , i said , what have you got to worry
he placed materials hospitably at inspector marriots elbow .
and charming manners !
i wouldnt lift a finger toto she faltered .
but look here , isnt there anything that i could do ?
go , henet , and i warn yoube careful of your words and actions .
and clara was walking out with the boots at the three boars .
there was a bit of trouble once or twice .
opening the door into the corridor , he called for the conductor .
and seldom get it ?
i might be an insect , the way he looks at mesomething that practically doesnt matter .

id seen in a paper that count stylptitch had recently died in paris .
perhaps had an affair with him ?
mysterious , exactly , hastings continued .
saying that itll need a lot of money to develop it in the way he wants to do .
vyse said nothing about the contents of the will .
poirot , what is all this getting at ?
they make their wretched secretaries get up at the most unearthly hours in order to dictate rubbish to them .
so then i thought well , perhaps i ought towell , i ought to tell someone , and i thought
luke bent his steps towards the old hall .
come if i sent for you .
linnet stared in surprise for a moment , then turned over the envelope .
a bright birds feather , a variegated leafthese things , i sometimes feel , are the true treasures of life
i dare say , said mrs .
i certainly dont think you ought to go by yourselves , said clapperton , smiling .
slowly and emphatically he wagged a finger up and down .
all im saying is there are curious features about the case .
theres another possibility , she said .
clayton ?
ardens consolidated are pretty good , dont you think ?
his hat pulled down over his eyes , and all buttoned uplike a crook on the pictures , i says
her hand , quietly appraising him .
ii craddock went out to the kitchen .
woman was surrounded by the members of her own family and household .
she looks to me as though she were going off her head .
from the beginning the problem has fascinated me .
the turning on of the wireless and the news was a welcome diversion .

theres something worrying you .
have it seen to !
so for example when , in chapter one , tuppence says tommy and tuppence were married .
that theres no knowing what i may do ?
it interests me to examine the possibility .
it was a hot night and several people went outside to get a breath of air .
oh , but believe me , you will do least harm by not interfering .
hallo , its you , burton .
she said she didnt want the car , so i was to drive it to the station and leave it
second-hand clothes trade , cheap jewellery stores , lots of things .
how did you find marlene when you arrived at the boathouse ?
you should come along here after its rained !
the night when we knew rosalind would be born we had a curious time .
take yourself off and remember ive got my eye on you !
of course she had an explanation of that ; but thinking of that explanation she was not quite easy in
grant said : youve read in the newspapers of the fifth column ?
whether he was pleased or chagrined i could not tell .
vipers point , he thought to himself as he rang the bell .
she had a hunted , harried look .
i dont think he is a reporter , miss .
she knows the value of being direct on certain occasions .
his eyes were wandering over her face and she thought to herself , hes making just as much a study
you are , in fact , the parfait gentil knight , murmured gerard .
the house agents also recognized it as that of mrs .

her first action was to seek out anna rosenburg at hampstead .

(customers reactions classified) , apparently didnt know anything about her , or her background .
linnet and simon smiled at each othera slow smile that took a few minutes to come to full fruition .
it makes it all seem so depressing .
just a minute , dr .
miss marple leant out a little further .
a billiard room , perhaps , a large kitchen with adjacent scullery , stone flags on the floor , a
we are expecting m .
the butler announced : miss warren .
he rang off and looked at julia .
the true solution , said joyce thoughtfully .
there was alarm in lucias voice as she asked , what do you mean ?
that look in the eyesthe look you see in a wounded dog or a sick horsedumb bestial enduranceit is odd
but the how and the why of things never seems to occur to them .
weve paid special attention to those who are new this termthat is mademoiselle blanche , miss springer and your secretary
a mad , fantastic thought leapt into her mind .
we saw ukhaidir , wonderful in its isolation , and about an hour or two after we had left it
esther walters detached herself from mr .
is he an old dog ?
but she likes living softthat ill swear im right about .
its sane , is it , to cut the throats of sheep and other animals ?
she was so cool always , so self-sufficient .
yeswhy did you say el greco ?
out of every fifty baskets , one will contain an imitation necklace in different coloured stones .
the great man looked at me and hesitated .
india and central asia .
we were left alone with sir guy and dr .
there was nothing inside to indicate who they came from .
it is not the facts i reflect uponbut the mind of the murderer .
it all seemed so silly .
the ball had been cleaned and put back on the fender .
a car had come up the drive .
about an hour either way .
olivers books .
perhaps thats why i didnt take it as seriously as i ought to have done .
fourteen i decidedly , said hercule poirot to himself the following morning , the spring is here .
petroch , loomouth , _num_ .
still presumably tina and micky had been out of it .
i put the sandwiches down there , clarissa told him , pointing to the stool , and then i began
wardmaid clearly to blame !
to do so , do see that your money is properly tied up on yourself .
race stared .
i realize that i must seem to you to be butting in in a matter thats not my concern well
if i think i have got a certain thing right in a bookthe way it should beim not easily moved
the jury .
she is now able to take care of mrs .
then i holdthat one is justified in executing sentence oneself .
i know something of them , naturally .
i just like my milk plain .
i came in visiting hours practically every evening .
vyse poirot clung firmly to the continental breakfast .
come here , and the instruction had perforce to cease .
and what do you know about mr .
your valises have been moved , monsieur , to the compartment no .
i think it hardly likely that i can help you , since i have not been able to help them
i suppose it isnt .
but not this time , he came to the conclusion , when he leaned back in his chair a quarter

shed previously frayed the cord of the lamp so that the wires were nearly bare .
, o , .
youve told me the bare facts , perhaps , he admitted .
ah , but it is incredible how often things force one to do the thing one would like to do
then he unbent and his manner softened a little .
well , i suppose so , said mrs .
i should never have dreamed of describing miss marple as trusting .
dont see how he could have been .
after tea , mrs .
always was convinced the servants were robbing him .
i am investigating the death of your uncle , captain joseph trevelyan .
i dare say im a fool , she said .
innocent middle-aged ladies on operating tables babbling words they hardly knew .
its a thing she never had herself , poor girl , so i suppose thats why she always covets it
anyway , they had a house down there .
well , i mean , thats interesting , isnt it ?
so that finished it ?
did he say nothing of any unusual symptom was there nothing about the appearance of the body which struck him
i have to oversee everything since my father has gone to the temple .
brother and sister were silent for some minutes .
that wordfey !
just when i was really settling down to it , lettice protheroe drifted in .
bletchley said , shrugging his shoulders : very well .
ive given him tea , but he seems to be staying on and on hoping to see you .
the kitchen gardens on the other hand , enclosed by red brick walls , were prosperous and well stocked .
ah ha , that is so , is it ?
and wont hardly take thanks for it .
simply because i realized that the dear fellow was seriously perturbed about me .
allerton , looking quiet and distinguished in her simple black lace evening gown , descended two decks to the dining
the great achmed abdullah !
higgs dropped his eyes bashfully .
what had been going on in that girls head ?
oh , lance , do be careful .
mortimer stared as if he could hardly believe his eyes .
and i quite see what you mean about liking to remember and read back over it .
without admitting it to herself , she felt nervous of going up to bed .
and , anyway , im not at all sure that it isnt actionableblackmail , you know .
but his actions filled me with surprise .
just seeing a jacobean drama ?
theres nothing wrong with you , my dear .
cayman , looking hopefully at bobby , if he left any last words or messages , naturally i want to
i dont , but i shall in half an hour .
she submitted , he thought .
just because shewellmaybe shes a bit nervy .
she was homesick , she wanted to go home .
mary was brushing her long fair hair in front of the mirror .
ssh , i warned him , for nortons voice had been incautiously raised and i was afraid old colonel luttrell
katherine sat perfectly still , looking after him .
i thought perhaps you might have done so .
you mean where tommy miss waynflete shivered .
your travel life has the essence of a dream .
on perfectly good terms , i should say .
a ring or something like that might have been missing , but no more .
cara zia is very important , very important indeed .
it could be actually so .
herself out a good dose and drank it .
there , is that all right ?
nobody knows what another person is thinking .
if we knew that , wed know very nearly all we wanted to know , said esa .
one was very tall , and had a long black beard , the other was short and stout .
father lavigny considered for a moment or two .
i wonder if there is any clue there to the mystery .
a simplified dinner had been served , and by mutual consent the house party had retired to their rooms after
theres no need to waste any more time .
she wasshe was dead , you know !
youve stirred him up with a stick and he doesnt respond ?
and giraud , the great giraud , he laughs , he thinks to himself , oh , he is imbecile
sheiwe lost our heads .
i sat a little away from it near mrs .
if only you had listened to me .
you know that fellow inglethorp is back ?
you couldnt have doubted my caring for you by this time ?
such details as there were , were meagre and unsuggestive .
facts went spinning round , turning new and unexpected faces .
do you seriously suspect archer ?
then she went along to linnet doyles cabin and shot her as well .
after breakfast he made the acquaintance of gladys , the third housemaid .
might as well enjoy it , if you know what i mean .
thats a preposterous idea .
quite bare each time i did so .
in every family there is usually one member who is a source of trouble and worry .
as we descended the stairs , he asked if he might walk round the garden .
in some respects she is morally colour blind .
but i warned him that he was getting himself mixed up with the wrong lot .
the daughters of the archdeacon were well grounded in household tasks .
i mean i wouldnt like to make any accusation unless i was absolutely sure about it .
it was no longer the station wagon .
ive told you all there is to tell .
a triangle , said poirot .
she was going into danemouth for a film test after the rally !
but i did know .
if this is what you call natural , mom ami words failed him .
the day turned out to be one of those indecisive days which might be fine , but , to those
that woman had to diehere !
general grant went on : whats wrong with the bunch theyre running with ?
thinking of the tear-stained passionate face i had seen that first day , i wondered .
its just that i feel were on a wild-goose chase .
the chauffeur was away at tea .
rafiel never spoke about the son .
she seemed a nice girlyes .
nor far from where you were all watching the fireworks .
' ' yes , but general , i shall have learnt a lot of do nots .
he hadnt sent any message by me , sir .
i quite understand your position .
used to go off for a stroll together to different parts of the island .
in any case , your passport arrived at heathrow even if you didnt .
for a while she heard a faint murmur of voices from the pantry .
you have such a trustful nature , battle .
then he said : you know , elinor , i believe we ought to go down .
ah , westway !
oh , well , miss elinor was always a very proud and reserved young lady .
hercule poirot replied : i am looking at the exception .
nobody will know .
for all her old-world charm , and the twinkle which is never far from her china-blue eyes , miss marple
what happened exactly on those two days .
i let the matter drop , of course .
i braced myself .
fortescue called him in and gave him a five pound note and told him to put it on the second

its not much good our sitting about here , making gloomy remarks , is it ?
it was on the bottom shelf .
theyve got me herein prison .
it must have been either the waiter or one of the five people round the table .
barked van aldin suddenly .
all tied up in a cocoon with their money , their traditional ideas .
he was a man of discrimination to lose himself .
he said rather heavily : then thats all right .
with an anguished cry of my pie !
how are you going to manage that ?
he twirled his moustache .
it had been , she thought , a well considered and well thought out letter .
poirot handed her his card , and a letter from the insurance company for mrs .
she was wearing them last night .
in plain language , a door banging suddenly would be more likely to kill mr .
and as far as you know , jessop was saying , those are the only people she talked to at
but i dont know why .
but i do not want to come , screeched mitzi , backing away from him .
she said , it all seems impossible then she gave a sudden gasp .
a big youth federation there .
i dont remember anything about it if so .
oh , said joanna .
something more than being merely childishly rude or saying unpleasant things .
look at our doll sitting at my private desk and writing letters now .
now i see that nothing has yet been touched in this room .
referring to the mysterious number four himselfor else it was the trademark , so to speak , of the big

snipped it carefully in half .
here elizabeth cole had joined him and was playing the piano to him .
as ive always said , i can put up with vulgarity , but i cant stand meanness !
frankie , you wouldnt ?
ive wondered once or twice whether he was feverish .
did i put mrs .
very well , said anne slowly .
you can do that presently .
i posed my cleverestmy most audacious question : was anyone with him ?

it was there that sir stafford nye had not been able to refrain from embarking on a few interesting suggestions
dilated exultantly .
ii on the following morning poirot paid a visit to scotland yard to his old friend chief inspector japp .
there is a lot in what you say , madame , said poirot .
with his usual precautions against cold , he was muffled up to the ears .
lily gamboll had been trained as a stenographer .
you dont remember me ?
he said : not a secret in the world .
and certainly it reads as a perfectly genuine ordinary epistle .
shes putting a good face on things at the moment , but you know what it is at this moment
i dont know , said renisenb .
one does know , more or less , after a lifetime of taking down statements , when a persons lying

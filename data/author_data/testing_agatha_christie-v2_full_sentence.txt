i believe he arrived at the golf hotel the day after mr .
it is blacka real black , not dark brownand it grows well back from my forehead and down over the ears .
i didnt meet anyone as far as i can remember .
still , hes at peace now .
but he had the feeling that that small painted boat tied up under the bridge had caused her uneasiness .
anyway , miss packard is very efficient and she has all the means to hand whereby she could produce a nice natural death without suspicion .
dora bunner exclaimed .
pretty little thing .
i talked to gina about it .
those were your words .
but shes been carefuldamnably careful .
tuppence directed him , and he returned in a few minutes with a cold pie and three plates .
then he became wrathful in a dry legal fashion .
raymond west is so frightfully clever as he pretends to be .
its who you know .
the dream i hercule poirot gave the house a steady appraising glance .
thats true , isnt it ?
no , there was more than that .
a tragedy ?
unceremoniously he tumbled out the things on the floor , mostly ties and handkerchiefs .
hurry , will you ?
pungnounpung .
miss warren paused , then she went on : it was very bad for me , of course .
i want you to get hold of the ryan girl .
ix ive got a question for you , doctor , said battle .
but who could have possibly wanted to kill her ?
i think , you knowyes , i certainly think something might be made out of this .
he had to take acase over to the other wing .
bentmore , in his summing up , had very rightly put the matter in its correct perspective , but the mischief was done by thenthe jury had believed the girl .
oliver managed to give poirot a more or less clear rsum of what she had been told .
sarah said quickly : you know , im by way of being a doctor .
to take human nature at its best , and the world as a pleasant place is undoubtedly the easiest course in life !
ill tell you about it on the way to the institute .
what my nephew calls superfluous women have a lot of time on their hands , and their chief interest is usually people .
i suppose , a well-educated girl says with interest , that you remember all about the crimea ?
stephen farraday said quickly : no more can i .
said shed bring up her children to have revenge .
things were drawing together , forming themselves into a compact nucleus .
safe .
and if we find the chambermaid was about , and did hear the typewriter going , well then , it seems to me that its all right and that well have to look elsewhere .
dreadfully sorry .
he arrived on the friday and on saturday i said if he was staying more than five days would he please let me have his ration book .
get me schedule b and let me see what we have in stock at present .
said mr bonnington .
sheshe spoke to me .
yes , her great friend .
the former said : my fathers portraitbut why ?
at the back of your mind you think she is concerned somehow in this case .
look here , you surely dont suspect old bessner pinched them ?
what wives do their husbands in with , or vice versa .
cut out the gipsys warning , santonix , i said , and take us round the house .
and possibly why mcnaughton had resigned his chair .
eyelash black , mascara , blue stain for under the eyes , at least twelve different shades of nail varnish , face tissues , bits of cotton wool , dirty powder-puffs .
the first real sorrow of my life was parting with nursie .
pam and kitty advanced on colonel clapperton .
he started off white and went on horse instead of haven .
stella , his wife , was small and fair .
now you state , sir , that you yourself have no connection with that case .
chapter _num_ startled , clarissa jumped to her feet .
hester .
he heard a faint sound which might have been either a sob or a laugh .
colonel melchett rubbed his nose .
rymer , said mr .
and with a flourish he waved aloft a small discoloured packet .
the funeral arrangements .
but it didnt seem to matter .
once when he and tuppence had had a flat near belsize park , he remembered walks on hampstead heath and a dog they had had whod enjoyed the walks .
i have handled that kind before .
on tuesday afternoon , sir .
he was relieved when mrs .
this business has got to stop , said monsieur grosjean .
luke said slowly : there are times when one cant afforddecency !
it taxied gently along the runway and presently came to a stop at the appointed place .
he was a wealthy soap manufacturer .
she took him away from mea chit of a girl she was then .
he ran down to me .
i just wondered if you werent being a little too exacting .
i wouldnt call her odd .
ha , very good thatvery good .
the trouble is that girls today know nothing of the art of flirtation .
well , thats rather the point , said craddock .
clarissa went across to her guardian before he could say any more .
my fingers are hardly sensitive enough for that , he said with a smile , and handed it to tuppence , who read out in a low voice : the duke of blairgowrie .
shes going to be at a house party at george lomaxs next week .
i was also , added philip deliberately , extremely fond of my father .
not that it sounds really exciting to me .
the situation sometimes arises when you realize that though it is a public room , other people talking do not realize that there is anyone else in it .
the seaweed had hung from that .
kennedy gave him a dry glance .
the inspector recognized poirot and greeted him in an almost reverential manner .
gerda had hurried off into her bedroom .
how dare you sir !
something a bit libellous , was it ?
he asked incredulously .
i didnt know that you were interested in roses , mr .
bundle left the room hurriedly , jimmy close behind her .
' she flushed .
the interesting thing is that valerie is ashamed of her family , and her family is ashamed of her .
caroline said : what do you mean ?
but i cant remember by now who it was sold to .
yes , said spence .
for good , rogers .
it would be a pity if you lost your job !
victoria opened her mouth and then shut it again .
the other , fernly park , is owned by roger ackroyd .
you have said that various changes were suggested in your scenario , some you resisted and some you accepted .
thats one of the gloves you were wearing day before yesterday , isnt it ?
so when i began to speculate who the third victim was likely to be , i plumped at once for you .
there is a change , she said .
i dont gossip about gipsys acre .
my brother came down here about a fortnight before the murder , and i crept out of the house to meet him secretly at night .
the long oval of her face and the slight angularity of her shoulders helped the illusion .
the irate words arrested on her lips , the woman came down the stairs smoothing her hair and hitching at her skirt .
weve got it all wrong , she said .
would you mind letting me see it , sir ?
you only dress it upits always been dressed upto impress people .
the secretary , miss brewis , already realized that there was very little wrong with lady stubbs mental processes .
flick !
then it was felt that his carelessness was the direct cause of the accident .
it is a nuance , a convention .
i mean , i didnt seriously believe didnt you , mr .
the wish to kill was in his heart .
come and sit down here in this chair and tell me about your dear mother .
george was angry .
a sudden rather roguish smile appeared on the old mans face .
one should see the world one lives in , said carelli dryly .
alas , we talked only of gas fires .
i should have felt the same myself .
monsieur , she said , i understand that you are now taking a vacation .
but sir charles was no longer playing the part of the great detective .
goedler has never been a strong womanbut she has retained to an astonishing degree the will to live .
leidner was the sort of woman who could easily make enemies .
un chien .
murmuring something about clearing away tea , maude left the room .
lemoine plenty of rope .
i discarded several adventurous methods , and plumped for stern simplicity .
he murmured in a slightly ironic voice : my dear lady , in my experience of ill-doing , providence leaves the work of conviction and chastisement to us mortalsand the process is often fraught with difficulties .
no , i suppose its pretty certain that the chinaman put the powdered opium in the curry , but hell never admit it , and we shall never know why .
nothing on any of the ladies , sir .
actually he has a kind of scar behind his left ear .
did you realize that it was mr clayton ?
well , perhaps from your point of view that is one way of looking at it .
perhaps , he added , as a knock sounded on the door , you have here your chance ; it may be our friend who enters .
you agree with me , im sure .
well .
he patted his pocket .
he paused a minute , then added : shes winnies godmother .
heaven give me patience , clarissa muttered between clenched teeth .
good morning , inspector craddock .
iris stood as though turned to stone .
film stars can lead a fairly insulated life , you know .
married a roman catholic , she said with significance .
it would have looked suspicious to ignore that wire .
what a pity that jane was such an inveterate liar .
she became meditative .
what was her last name ?
he wasnt killed there , he was put there afterwards .
who wants to kill you ?
you have been very kind .
it was oddvery odd .
abernethies will , i understand .
its a scarabee , or some name like that .
i am assisting the french police in an important case .
armstrong said quickly : i , am a well-known professional man .
not that it isnt often successful !
what is the matter with monsieur poirot ?
and thats flat .
why did you go to ramat , miss rich ?
yes , i remembered that the sisters name was charlotte , and that dora bunner had called miss blacklock lotty once or twiceand that each time she did so , she had been very upset afterwards .
they thought they knew who did it .
ask her to watch over the family well and shield them from harm .
poirot had been eloquent to rosamund and had dwelt on the advantage it would be to linda to have something to take her out of herself .
she must have loved someone and then something went wrongperhaps he died .
at first mrs .
she would have let herself be arranged for the part by any of the people connected with the fte .
in mr sellons time .
' _num_ hercule poirot stood looking straight across the water to the blue line of hills on the mainland of asia .
lombard said with a grin : thats all .
it is an exciting experience seeing cattle rounded up , and all the various aspects of station life .
cantankerous old devil , said bryan eastley cheerfully .
it was inky black , and i could hear the rushing of water .
bollard and whitley , old established jewellers and watchmakers .
strange , thought sarah , that once a jebusite should have made this rocky summit into a threshing floor and that david should have purchased it for six hundred shekels of gold and made it a holy place .
things were hardly in running order .
and then , three or four years later shed got double pneumonia and died .
bottle of aspirin .
perhaps you ' ll get the key .
lovely day , isnt it ?
you had an idea , i think , of the reason that should prompt me to send .
how was the front door fastened ?
i shall be gone only a very short time , dear , she said , just back to my bungalow , to see where i could possibly have put that pattern .
i can see that if those accidents werent accidents , they must have been engineered by somebody very near at handsomebody whoknows me .
blore said : what kind of a curtain was it ?
he had snipped a piece from mr .
ellie said , gipsys acre .
i was still bending over the open silver table when flora ackroyd came into the room .
dont see why she should , though .
her eyes , hard and contemptuous , ranged over the faces turned towards her .
it was the legacy of her consumptive mother .
and miss williams chipped in and said : the best way you can help your sister , angela , is to do what she wants you to do without making a fuss about it .
ruby keene , so he admitted privately , might have asked for what was coming to her , but pamela reeves was quite another story .
thats why he said she wouldnt be much help .
denise and franoise had run to their mistress , and leaving her in their charge poirot left the house .
w-w-would you ?
i dont mean , said lance , that hes a swindlernot anything like that .
borrow money off you , want favours .
she did so and , waving a hand , ran back to the gate , where anne was standing .
chloral .
she said : m .
ii when the gong sounded for breakfast at nine oclock it found everyone up and awaiting the summons .
richard went off in a great state about you .
sometimes , she said meditatively , things arrange themselves quite simply .
proposing ?
it was , midge decided , a very lucyish reception .
she cant have .
an awful bore , but hes high up in government circles , and you know what life is nowadays .
not too badly .
it seemed to bobby that mrs .
there was quite a hiss in his voice as he said in a quick , low voice , why did you send for the police , mrs .
and suddenly , hercule poirot was himself againthe spell was broken , he was once more in harmony with his patent-leather shoes and natty , dark grey gents suiting .
rivington talks supposing , said bobby , pausing on the doorstep , that mr .
but the thing that made the greatest impression upon me was what this child herehe looked at hestersaid to me as i left .
it came suddenly to the fore when he was finally seated in the boat train .
poirot said to lane : you are , i think , the tallest of us , monsieur .
pilar shrugged her shoulders .
by the corner of the eye , where a bangle kait wore on her wrist had cut the skin , a small trickle of blood was running down her face .
he smiled very faintly .
i must confess it does remind me , just a little , of old mrs .
i suppose people had gastric and duodenal ulcers and had to be careful , but i cannot remember anybody living on a diet of fish and milk .
he tried to imitate her calm , to keep his voice from shaking .
this delay , i assure you , has been necessary , he said .
tuppence , that was mr .
look there now !
if you do that i shall be very , very pleased , said mrs .
it is the shock , the emotionmy heart .
ding dong dell , pussys in the well , said miranda .
copyright _num_ john curran the secret adversary _num_ .
without tommy the flat was empty , the world was lonely , and what on earth , thought tuppence , am i to do with myself ?
what have we here ?
hercule poirots eyes stole to his plan .
you have no regrets , olga vassilovna ?
unfortunately old age doesnt get cured , it only gets more so , doesnt it ?
they think a lot of him at the yard .
youve heard , havent you ?
now , tuppence , be a good sydney thames .
a ding-dong battleneither side able to score below .
i took a letter from my pocket .
it seems infinitely longer .
its a way , oddly enough , ive never come across before .
she has already begun to display symptoms of schizophrenia .
and after all , weve all got to take our chance in this life !
wheres that paper ?
well , i guess id better buy a car , a slap-up one , dress as a chauffeur and hang about outside .
bit of a shindy there , chap drew a revolver .
we could start , said terence .
andrew restarick and mr .
i rose , went to the table at the other side of the room and returned with the paper in question in my hand .
having thanked her coldly , he withdrew .
devoted to gervase .
be careful , or theyll rope you in .
he rose , put on his mourning face , and shook hands with the major .
he offered me one of the tiny russian cigarettes he himself occasionally smoked .
the countrys good for you , my girl .
you cant think such a thing could happen , but it did happen .
beryl larkin had come forward .
of course im right .
its a vulgar world nowadays .
i knew sir henry and mr .
well , this is a great pleasure .
leave them at the bank .
blast him , said tim .
so unscrupulous , rowena .
none of us thought so !
greenshaws folly was first published in _num_ and was collected in the adventure of the christmas pudding in _num_ .
i would do anythinganythingto save my wife unhappiness .
are you still there ?
but i think what weve said so far is fairly sound sensegranted , that is , the wild improbability of the whole thing .
it missed any vital spot , luckily .
sir rowland smiled .
well , she must have been in the english espionage or security whatever it was called .
that fish isnt fresh .
she held it out to him .
' it was quite simple- an accident .
i am quite aware of that fact , madame .
i shall be murdering her next .
oliver helpfully .
plain .
how extraordinarily nicely his hair grew down with a little twirl into his neckand what a nice neckbronzed red brown from the sunwith no blemishes on itso many men had necks with cysts or pimples where their collars had rubbeda neck like sir ruperts for instance , with a boil just starting .
at that moment , the master himself came out of the great fold and , emboldened by his benignant smile , miss carnaby ventured to speak her mind to him .
lance grinned suddenly .
ansell had not transacted any legal business previously for mrs .
his task completed , he sat back with his head on one side contemplating the result .
ive left the furniture in this house and a small annuity to bunny .
the real brain works behind the scenes .
david , she admitted ruefully , was an exciting person .
where mr .
oh , well , you can do with a rest .
five years ?
its this way , m .
bmr .
cried dr .
they ' d quarrelled years ago .
maynt be on the boat .
the countess has a great deal more perspicacity than you have , my dear hastings .
miss marple looked enquiring .
the first case must concern some celebrated public figure , it must be sensational and of the first importance !
were the perrys living here then ?
this time the mental picture did not correspond with the reality .
i know all about ittook it to the lawyers for him after hed drawn it out .
very young poor child .
the major had something he quite patently wished to conceal .
dermot craddock laughed .
theres the yellow-haired hussy who works for him , said mrs .
the commissionaire was saying : believe youre right , sirhes illwhywhats the matter , sir ?
for the first time i noted discrepancies in it which i had disregardedan assurance of money , the power to buy back the diamonds of nadina , the way in which he had preferred to speak of both men from the point of view of an outsider .
everything boiled up last night .
you think its all bunkum on my part , mr .
yes , yahmose ?
something that you hadnt thought of before , or perhaps hadnt thought worth mentioning .
and with them came the memory of her husbands face , photographed clearly on her brain , as he said , do you think it wise , alix , thisbluebeards chamber business ?
married mr .
she was perfectly normal and hearty .
i went over plans in my head .
oliver , or perhaps they didnt want toerwell , encourage her by saying they believed it .
then he said slowly : taking everything into account , and without any bias whatever , i am of the opinion that no form of arsenical poisoning could account for the symptoms in miss arundells case .
she gave a little shiver , then she plunged once more into dressmaking details .
i think shes very nice , said miss pierce .
thats the result of a fine english summer for once in a way .
things like that , family gets served first .
he hated being kissed by her and later still , hed taken a pleasure in thwarting her silly plans for him .
any time after three .
to establish the idea of a local maniac .
below them the brown and golden leaves shivered a little in the chill of a grey autumn day .
the charge , he said , is murder in the first degree .
we discussed glyndebourne and its music for a while , and then hermia remarked : were not going to dover for breakfast , are we ?
who murdered who ?
it makes no matter .
a private sale ?
after that , things happened very fast .
nonsense , said her husband .
rayburns got a scar , i knowbut a scar can be faked easily enough .
as i say , i was convinced from the first moment i saw her that mrs .
well done !
his views on anything were unlike anybody elses , and if i spent half an hour talking to him i went away so stimulated by the ideas he had put into my head that i left the house feeling as though i was walking on air .
your brother-in-law doesnt like mehes made that quite clear .
yes , wasnt he ?
oh , all right , said rosalind , gloomily , and went away .
superintendent harper cleared his throat .
that man sugden is as obstinate as a mule .
it was mary aldin at his elbow .
dont you feel , david , that an experience like this has broadened your mind ?
next , reaching for the telephone which stood by his elbow , i gave the number of the vicarage .
first , i think , we should take the evidence of the wagon lit conductor .
craddock did not reply .
wetherby still felt vaguely upset .
there would even be charred bodies in the plane .
he joined up in the army at eighteen .
i asked cautiously .
hes hercule poirot .
she added with a smile , i like having somebody young about the place .
poirot stared at him .
mary gerrard has gone to london and is starting to train for a masseuse .
was she a great friend of your wife ?
but its the murder charge im worrying about .
if i had been the murderer , i would have slipped over on a day trip to france or belgium and discarded the dead mans passport in a train or a tram so that the inquiry would take place from another country .
you see , its obviously not a case of small doses of arsenic administered regularlywhich is what you might call the classic method of arsenic poisoning .
i went in at two oclock to settle my dear comfortably , as i always do , and she was lying there awake .
billingsley was shaking his head violently .
that , it seems to me from all i have heard , was extremely unlikely !
yes , i know , but one could stretch it a bitwhat ?
i think she was puzzled and unhappy about what happened and was coming to me to ask me why the marriage did not take place .
ive reason to be .
anyway , louise charpentier was his mistress at one time .
and im afraid shes taken pains to cultivate the legend .
i just stopped her putting it in the fire .
the recipe is just an indication .
yesdecidedly she is afraid of something .
reilly , you engaged nurse leatheran here to keep your wife company and allay her fears ?
never mind your neck , said tuppence unfeelingly .
no , here it is .
rosamund .
inspector sharpe spoke for the first time .
with an escaped murderer as a secretary , i had no hesitation whatever in substituting blanks .
he said : so thats it , is it , vera ?
i thought i was going to be late .
rafiel , but i shouldnt have said there was anything there that could do him much good .
philip wheeled himself over to the writing table .
she still hated rosemary barton on this day a year later .
lead the way .
the shadow moved awayand miss marple saw who it wasit was jackson .
i see you understand .
it is deeply to be regretted , and miss marple felt guilty even admitting it to herself , but she was not as satisfied as she ought to be .
i see youve got miss marple .
who is selma goetz ?
but there he drew a blank .
you know , marry him and reform him , train him and settle him down to a nice steady job .
all i can tell you is she gives me the creeps every time i pass her .
but i am handicapped .
oh , darling onemy bundlemy own dearest , sweetest bundle .
of course its some woman .
-- - ' th tlax curls .
would you be wanting anything , madam ?
lily margrave was seated at a desk by the window , writing .
you ' re pulling my leg .
of course , i admitted , we dont know what those papers may have been .
nearly all excavations up to then had been of an historical nature , but now everyone was passionately interested in pre-historic civilisation , about which as yet so little was known .
they passed her , harold bowing slightly .
i guess you did your best , but you misdirected me badly .
the urgency was because you might have committed a murder .
one thing ive been meaning to ask you , sir .
the sofa was the answer .
you see , she lived for many years with mr .
why did he make you give up the army and come to live here ?
i should infinitely prefer it .
the dearest and gentlest of men .
he has thrown his cards upon the table .
take what you like .
it began quite simply , said victoria , with a man coming into my room at the tio hotel and getting stabbed .
how can i thank you , dear mr .
i have no doubt of that .
those mr .
inspector craddock thought it was wonderful , too , but he was not quite so warmly appreciative .
come on , doug .
joanna had an inkling of the truth then .
never to deapiae the trivial - the undignified .
treacle tart .
immediately afterwards ?
vincenti must go to richard .
they did not accompany you to littlegreen house on your visits ?
he drew some papers towards him , then thrust them back and picked up his telephone .
decidedly , i must have a finger in this pie .
he was still worried .
im flattered at your asking me .
barnes had suggested a potential criminal could be found .
that deep depression of despair , that dark desperate grief .
she might have got herself in a jam of some kind .
a bit obvious , perhaps , but anyway it would get rid of her for a bit .
we of the east appreciate bravery .
we can state definitely now that your husband died as a result of eserine poisoning .
they had some ideas about it .
not the least idea .
on his right a passage branched at right angles to what was evidently the dining room .
you may rest assured , m .
i hadnt really got down to the job , though , continued lawrence .
adams , with a faint smile , one does usually mention the important people .
continue , monsieur , said poirot .
carrington .
	when he finally withdrew , pontifical to the last , i met 	poirot ' s quizzical eyes .
for at that moment she herself had glanced casually out of the other window which gave on to the rhododendron shrubbery , and had perceived a highly unwelcome sight , none other than lady veronica carlton-sandways , weaving her way along the path , her large black velvet hat on one side , muttering to herself and clearly in a state of advanced intoxication .
that it was only fair to her .
she flung out a hand to the room .
really , of course , randall never dreamed that id outlive him .
ill admit that straightaway .
he said instead : oh !
murderers are usually vain .
never been there .
his brow creased itself a little as though in perplexity .
i dont see how he managed that .
you had no suspicions at the time of mr .
ah , yes , said sir charles soothingly .
but she left the room on her errand without any further remark , and returned almost immediately to say that mademoiselle saintclair would see us in her room .
she got off the bus .
it rings in barretts room upstairsthe bell hangs over her bed .
she was the kind of girl , he thought , that a man might easily lose his head over .
commercial travellers dont usually carry loaded guns in their pockets , he said .
it was an april day such as usually occurs at least once in a month , hotter than most of the june days to follow .
stoddart , assured mr .
she tries to be kind , thats all .
oh , said luke .
not to be outdone , poirot returned the bow and extracted his own card .
it is a chance , decidedly a chance .
ii you are worried , arent you lotty ?
she forgot about them and left them in carlotta adams handbagher one mistake .
thats what my aunt told me , what ive always been told .
and so , on this august morning , he was glad that he was leaving london and going to be for some days on an island off the devon coast .
the original is filed here and was handed to us by miss iris marle , who recognizes the writing as that of her sister .
but , poirot , i cried .
she was cleaning a flower border .
i , on the other hand , watched him with breathless interest .
well , i said after a minute or two .
well , of course .
youre making a sad mistakebut yours will be the loss .
mais oui .
i sent you ?
rather unwillingly , she moved a few steps aside .
well , cant you tell me what youre talking about ?
mittel europa refugee of some kind .
theres a lack in you , veronica .
i dont see how he can be anything but on the squarehe doesnt make any money out of the show .
the cook had had nothing to do with it , he declared , no hand had touched it but his own .
she appraised her face seriously , frowning a little .
i have not resented rosaleenbut i do resentyou !
a tiny sliver of looking glass .
an excellent idea , said doctor carver .
poirot , ive never come across anything of the kind before .
she brushed past him and went out of the room , banging the door .
you may be right , i said doubtfully .
john stuck his head in at this juncture , and invited us both to come up to mrs .
and what should we do then ?
satterthwaite , you dont understand our anglo-saxon complexes .
oh , student unrest is just one flower on the tree .
she smoothed down her hair , picked up pad and pencil , and knocked at the principals door .
he was not too well pleased at having the stranger foisted upon him through mr .
then , of course , the thing would be simplicity itself .
still , i wish id just mentioned it .
a receiver of stolen goods , especially jewels .
writes beautifully involved and ornate letters with long words in them .
devoted nephew will inherit but is there anything to inherit ?
is that all it is ?
poirot , i said , your gaiety does not deceive me .
well , they used to have them .
miss ackroyd , i said , wants you toto to find the murderer , said flora in a clear voice .
did you take the money from the drawer and give it to your brother ?
thats right , said mrs .
but now to our next interview .
satterthwaite accompanied him to where a big , clumsy young man was leaning against the wall surveying the world at large from behind the barricade of a ferocious scowl .
where did bury come from ?
i admit , he said , that one never quite allows for the moron in our midst .
revolving these things in her mind , mrs .
she was not important , you see .
we had originally bought it second-hand .
then its up to me to decide whether action is possible or nothaving regard to the international aspects .
it had been reported that the prime minister had said to someone that young waring would go far .
the wild race through the dew-laden park the night before had given him a chill .
how dyou do .
its a funny way of putting it , dont you think ?
people cant treat me like that and get away with it !
he felt once again the faint tremor that shook her , and he reached up for her hand .
asked blunt quickly .
battle looked at leach .
you can leave it all to us , sir rowland assured her .
and tina thinks micky had something to do with it .
some of them true , some of them harmlessbut all served up in a spicy manner .
you are in love with each other ?
and there was nothing in the fireplace itself ?
just three pictures in the window artily arranged with a drape of limp velvet in some neutral colour arranged over a corner of a gilt frame .
no , hastings , what intrigues me is the psychology of the matter .
those two always seemed so happy .
sometimes patent medicines or remedies , brands of aspirin , cough pastilles , sleeping pills , pep pills , gargles , mouthwashes , indigestion remedies and so on .
where are you taking me now ?
maur again .
merrowdenei knew her at once .
id only go on worrying and puzzling and thinking .
hes really very keen on gardening , said tommy .
i considered sophias father .
awkward if the girl wanted to blow her nose , said the practical mr .
a wise decision .
she answered his questions readily enough and with competence .
i carry on a dressmaking business under the name of rose mond ltd at _num_ brook street .
a kind of queen bee .
its my home and i live in it , said miss greenshaw .
poor fellow , poor fellow , said mr .
it is ever since mr .
it looked like it .
ive been sleuthing , said mrs .
the point is not whether people will read them or nottheyll read them fast enoughbut their publication at this juncture might ruin everythingeverything .
that it was an extraordinarily good imitation , said mr .
i got it from the butler .
inglethorps chequebook , and on being reversed at a mirror , showed clearly the words : .
he looked into her wondering face and laughed .
thats quite enough to put on their plates for the time being .
so far theyve got away with the goods all right .
its like being besieged .
somebody , shall we say , for some reason wants our land .
more probably a secretaryand a secretary engaged not very long ago .
meaning , said craddock thoughtfully , that one of the patients wasnt as ill as the others ?
what a brute i am , edward .
for gods sake , joanna , dont speak so understandingly !
oh , i seeyou want me to come down to enderby ?
youre always the sameany pretty girl .
i suppose sir eustace has got them with him .
i suppose , since the arrest , it isnt necessary , i said .
jean dupont , who had outlined the death by a wasp sting theory , and who was sitting on the gangway so near giselle that he might just possibly have moved from it without being noticed .
indeed there was a moon and by its light the drivers could be seen frantically at work with jacks and stones , striving to raise the wheels .
i kept quiet and well out of archies way , which seemed the only attitude that was of any help to him .
im rather fond of children , said anthony .
thats the housethat one there .
the last representation of the merry wives i sawin _num_ had so much arty production about it that you felt you had travelled very far from a bit of winter sun in windsor old park .
it would matter to me , my dear .
stephen farr said gently : youre not the only one who feels like that .
what about it , audrey ?
she really is a nice girl .
s and drew them sharply apart .
major erskine ?
i was able to say what i wanted without too much difficulty .
we will put x against his name .
(not surprisingly , when you look at those stern jacket photographs .
poisoning in particular .
to reconstruct the crimethat is the aim of the detective .
charles enderby and emily exchanged glances .
you saw mr .
i thought it was nice of the old boy to use the pronoun you .
he was laughing and chaffing the beautiful mrs vanderlyn , who was sitting on the other side of her host .
the inspector pressed on .
she was interested in the work and asked questions about it and made notes .
it was his constant dictum that all the world knew hercule poirot .
we were friends and playmates , but the idea of doing what she told me never occurred to me .
it seemed to me the most unlikely thing in the world that lettice protheroe should go out of her way to interfere in our domestic affairs and reprove our maid for slovenly housework .
some days later this girl norma , after having heard you talk about me at a party , comes to call upon me and she says to me that she is afraid that she may have committed a murder .
i think , said poirot , miss chadwick loved meadowbank too much his eyes went across to miss bulstrode .
it is handed over on racecourses , and in antique dealers , sometimes in a crowded multiple store .
there was a womanish strain in his character which lent him insight into the feminine mind .
i get too het up over these things !
and offering to give those two boys of his by his first marriage a home with her because it would be more settled for them .
i came on and took his place .
hes a terrible man really .
its just that i am not really a safe person to be with .
he was still at frankfurt .
die ?
joanna whirled angrily out of the room .
youll see , hell be drugged on the train !
ive got her history taped out quite clearly .
everything , said mr ditchburn .
elinor said , one does feel that people ought to be set free if they themselves really want it .
for the last five years captain trevelyan has only had one servantretired naval chap .
miss marple herself was gently garrulousshe was enjoying her stay in dillmouth so much andwasnt it exciting ?
i have only just heard .
i hustled him out , and i went back to the kitchen and i went to lay for supper at the usual time .
i think she almost hates me sometimes .
castle drew herself up .
he must have been ripe for falling in love with someone else , though he perhaps didnt even know it himself .
i wandered about a long time , looking for heror for myselfi dont know which .
he began prowling gently round the room .
on the whole , though , it seemed unlikely that there was a sex angle to marlene tuckers death .
i put every penny i had on it and it won by a length .
you have not called in the police ?
just a few words were distinguishable : now , thats interesting , said mr .
you can believe me if you wish to believe me .
a nice little thing seemed to be the accepted description .
he was more or less georges dog .
he wanted to put the frightened rabbit gladys at her ease .
he startedlooked up .
its major palgrave .
then blurted out hurriedly , i say , are you on the telephone here ?
the momentary paralysis over , she flung back her head and screamed .
he was not a man for confiding troubles , said esther .
one case you know of , m .
hes seen quite enough , apparently , to make him cross over if he sees me coming along the high street .
you dont trust her ?
as far as hes concerned the whole business is closed with miss griffiths arrest .
thank you sir .
he added quickly : this is off the record , mind .
what the devil began hardcastle .
you might know .
miss politt was tall and gaunt , with a sharp nose , pursed lips , and meagre iron-grey hair .
i dont know that i want to go to rowlands castle , said elizabeth doubtfully .
i suppose i should only get the cold shoulder if i ever went butting in at charnley .
the day had been fine and dry , so our feet were not likely to leave any prints ; nevertheless , we wiped them carefully on the mat before entering .
also , the letters are printed .
if so try to get him to hold his tongue .
goby clearly was of that opinion .
joshuas dog ?
why , of course , cried evesham .
have you any idea of the cause of that worry ?
it was young ross .
must be interesting ?
i shall get married to desmond whenever i like !
diets nonsense of course but i shouldnt wonder if he had consulted a doctor about his health and what the doctor said gave him a bit of a jolt .
if i could only swarm about halfway along it , the proposition would be solved .
carpenter ?
i have been throughout my career exceptionally successful .
hold the candles down low , will you , swettenham ?
this was on top .
perhaps i was getting a little tired of her .
you wouldnt think it , said battle behind him , but thats supposed to be the cleverest detective in france .
it was qu : a long time before the silence was broken .
besides , i cant believe that he would do it that way .
fifteen passengers not including herself , or mrs .
you havent appreciated lucy interrupted .
well , well , well , said the man called ivor smith .
the young man winced .
dont let fayll do you down .
take your time , said seldon , and tell me about it .
we have two poor women living here with very bad rheumatoid arthritis .
pennington isnt bold .
it will take two of you to do that , she instructed him .
farther on there was an anachronism , a large white modern building , austere and irrelevant to the cheerful haphazardness of the rest of the place .
i mean that , though this lady is rich and beautiful and beloved , there is all the same something that is not right .
with an air of infinite reluctance m .
that in itself was unusual .
no , you did not .
i began writing a novel .
but i hate saying itit sounds so awful .
oh , the ship was sunk there right enough , said the inspectoralong with a good company of others .
was there anyone in the waiting room while you were there ?
occasionally with a shout of balek , balek , a donkey or laden mule pushed past her , or men bearing great loads balanced on their backs .
i didnt quite gather , said molly , looking rather helpless .
you meanshe did it all the time ?
why , doctor , you havent said anything , said jane .
but she was set upon it .
but it really is very exciting to come across someone who does seem to know about everything .
you must really excuse me , m .
hullo , everybody , whats going on tonight ?
ach !
catherines hospital .
i dont like this place .
she said his name , first softly , then with increasing desperation .
and mrs vandedyn ?
the hell you dont !
what did you mean by one or two things ?
its just one of those things that doesnt work .
he murmured : cralei seem to remember .
you are beautiful , madame ; you are rich ; you are clever ; intelligentand you have charm .
he wants me to give him his freedomto divorce him .
behind it were some frames .
not atomic age .
she has been invaluable to me as a secretary-companion , and is also a very efficient housekeeper .
you are like that .
supposing that after all .
i think ive got everything , she said , putting down wool , workbag , and a library book .
shaitana , that you had no private connections or business dealings with him , that there was no question of his having injured you at any time and your bearing resentment .
oh , in quite a legal way .
before she had got to fifty , her mind was off again on the same track .
mon ami , it is a good plan to take a place as chambermaid or valetbut you must not shirk your work .
but i get to thinking afterwards .
she thought of jackoand repeated to herself that justice had been done .
dubois who made the inquiry .
it might be .
women indeed ?
we were both recklessanxious to get killed .
i could have snapped out of it but i didnt .
im just interested .
no quarrelling - nothing like that .
the chest was nearly empty , and there , reposing right at the bottom , was a magnificent black beard .
i do remember arguing with elsa on the subjecttrying to show her , i mean , that it was a pretty rotten thing to do .
bet i wont .
with a deft hand he whisked away the last enveloping cloth , and the object it concealed was revealedan almost life-sized wooden doll , dressed in a velvet suit and lace collar .
) victor said , watching her : but you know that as well as i do .
thats just what its best not to say , sir .
but for the benefit of anyone who listens in at meadowbank , or who overhears , or who is told , it is as well to think they are already there and no longer in your possession .
he walked to the end of the street and back .
he (or she) must have thought that shaitana had definite evidence .
aunt jane , said bunch , dont look so upset .
then she said to me , you didnt like it , did you ?
yes , the hands pointed to _num_ : _num_ .
im afraid ive been a bit tactless , eh ?
as for ourselves , there is miss logan , who was aunt lucys companion , and who runs the house for me , and captain radclyffedennis , you know , whom i told you about , and there is a girl called mary chilcott , an old school friend of mine who is staying with us .
my father , said yahmose drily , showed no signs of displeasure .
italy , murmured lucia with a faraway look in her eyes , as she placed her handbag beside her on the settee .
pat came down the stairs with him .
shes far too generous .
kilmorden castle .
it was a mistake .
todd regrets that after all she will not avail herself of mr .
there was the small plot of earth that had been supposed to be his own garden .
he thought her a hard creature but a person of integrity .
some homicidal maniacthats what it looks like to me .
and it is thisboy who will defeat the master criminal of our time ?
why , its impossible .
had he come there casually ?
it is addressed to a captain oneill at rue de quenelles no .
weve got to get out of here .
at a guess between fifty and sixty .
i suppose , said major burnaby , that you are off back to london today ?
but the father !
i never said no , but you thought !
he doesnt like the suntanning crowd .
hercule poirots eyebrows rose a little on his egg-shaped head .
edward goring .
you drive me into a corner , monsieur poirot , you do indeed .
but she was stupid , you comprehend , stupid like a brute beast .
poirots voice was dangerous as he said very quietly : there you are wrong .
it was the sort of exciting chance that might never happen again .
it also occurred to him that if you were married to christine redfern , the atmosphere might be so rarefied that the arlena stuarts of this world would hold a particular attraction for you .
possible , very possible , he said .
do you really suppose thats a question i can answer just like that ?
leonides , and rich city men who wanted to be in with leonides , so they could take their choice of acquaintances .
im a woman with an obsession .
you could either go into the battery garden or you could continue on the same path , which led down to the seashore .
but i still consider that poirot was guessing .
not much more than a child .
he didnt mind telling me .
poirot looked at him with malicious amusement .
you are a bacteriologist , are you not , dr .
it was the first that i had seen close up .
except the valet .
they stood there for a moment or two , and then tim spoke .
its at my place of business .
the flesh and the spirit ?
you mean fortreason is the word , isnt it ?
im quite sure about that , tommy .
i just wondered if he was right .
the coast was clear .
april _num_ th preposterous !
what did you playothello ?
poirot got up briskly .
were all nervous and jumpy .
let us not discuss the bomb , said hercule poirot .
he looked at her in encouragement .
i am going up to london today , she said lightly .
she could see it all very clearly .
you are like her , renisenb .
derek leaned forward , answering her , and katherine sat almost dazed .
he considered what mrs .
seeing him go down the hill .
i opened the morning paper and a minute or two later joanna entered looking somewhat shattered .
he has come here for close on ten years now hes a kind of landmark in the place .
undoubtedly the dossier is a great institution .
do you deny that you paid the rent of _num_ malland mansions , earls court ?
theres nothing wrong with any of the lights here , he said .
and then , suddenly , sybil spoke .
poisoned tablets , said miss marple thoughtfully .
so thats suspect no _num_ perfectly placed for committing the crime .
nonsense , said bobby .
charles is deadmurderedand but for me he would be alive .
she bent her glance on a table at which four men sat together .
youve no idea of what you might come up againstthese men will stop at nothing .
hes a thorough young rake , i should say .
i rejoined my friend .
it would have been different had you been his sister instead of his sister-in-law .
so there is robin upward , comfortably established , with madres purse to back his ventures , and then into his assured world comes mrs .
he had had the misfortune to marry a tiresome and temperamental wife .
i like herbut i think he looks dreadfulso conceited !
you give them that sometimes .
shes a topper , an absolute topper .
christine took a minute or two to think .
when i can raise the money , laughed nick .
she appeared to be somewhat out of breath .
all the principal statesmen of europe .
(here the entries cease) it was , i think , on august _num_ th that i received the letter .
but the man merely shook his head and murmured something that katherine could not catch and moved away , not reappearing until the train came to rest at the station , when he started handing her belongings down from the window .
shes bound to be somewhere on board .
only the last lady , miss shirty .
but she might be upset and confused .
do you mean that either miss griffith or mr .
colonel melrose came quickly to the rescue .
then she went slowly up to annette .
comes back ?
that discovery acted upon him with terrific force .
o course i know now .
you cant go carting bodies about at dead of night .
i do not apologize .
instead of going to the bathing beach she settled herself in a shady corner of the terrace .
but he was desperate .
i cant think why clergymen are so fond of quoting from the classicsfor one thing one never understands what they mean and it always seems to me that the whole subject matter of the classics is very unsuitable for clergymen .
do you really think you will ?
didnt she tell you ?
this led us quite naturally to mrs .
i came down one morning to find papa excited to the point of apoplexy .
they were just sitting downall but amyas , who had remained down in the battery painting .
calgary sighed .
he asked politely .
have arranged for m .
the only other thing he said and then stopped .
they got outside kk .
ioh , i dont know .
i hope to have done jerusalem thoroughly in a couple more days , and im letting them get me out an itinerary at cooks so as to do the holy land thoroughlybethlehem , nazareth , tiberias , the sea of galilee .
to his surprise he could not at first see mr farley and thought the room was empty .
but there it is ; theyre her only near relations , and her death brings them a tidy sum of money , ive no doubt .
as soon as i knew i managed to return it .
' he did not want a new trunk .
let us see now whether my father will be as much of a stick in the mud as ever , or whether i shall be able to convert him to up-to-date methods .
distinct on the soft mould were footprints .
vavasour and mr .
the police are doing their best .
the old sea-horse , crotchety and useless as we had always thought him , had had enough sense to notice that somebody was drowning and had come out in the boat allowed him for the purpose .
ive always been sensitive to paint .
how would it be if you went on firstto break the news to my mother that i am free while you break it in person to mademoiselle marthe , eh ?
then i thought that henriettas affair with john would run the usual course .
no doubt she was vastly pleased with herself .
do you think it will ever take place , sir ?
i think it would do us all good to get out , said miss barrow .
someone knew enough to feel that his crime would be attributed to her .
i struck her out of the book .
a fresh buzz of excitement broke out and was sternly silenced by the judge .
in a superior manner !
you dont know anything about me , do you ?
raymond west nodded and noted the time on his watch .
oliver , beginning to unwrap a package on the table which she had obviously recently purchased , the trouble with you is that you insist on being smart .
he stole a glance at her now .
hear !
there had been a few sherdsnot many , owing to the small spaceand they were of a different period to those found higher up .
i was frightfully hungry and i had some .
then leave a message with someone else to be given to joan in england .
it must be done , he murmured to himself , and soon , as soon as i can make the opportunity .
they are so much in the limelight that their movements must be carefully ordered .
he went out by the garden , and through the same door as in the afternoon .
here , let me sit down .
ah , how do you do ?
the room was nicely though plainly furnisheda bed , a chest of drawers , a washstand and a chair .
terence had been out of favour the last few days for breaking the cona coffee machinesome nonsense about trying to make ammonia .
a siropexcuse me ?
so far all was well , but when we arrived at the top and prepared to have lunch , the guide excelled himself .
if the gods could strike down ygdrasil , then nothing was safe !
morphia .
he knocked at the end door and a voice said , come in .
she apologized , a thin smile on her face .
but now we come to a really interesting point .
have you had anything to eat this morning , evie ?
outside there was the squealing of brakes and a girls loud scream .
his suggestion that she had come there to be near edward had made her angry at the time and she had vigorously denied it , but she realized now that it was infinitely safer that dr .
but this time it was unmistakably angry in its tonea fierce cat yowl , long-drawn and menacing .
when you were so kind as to show me the dagger and draw attention to the fingerprints .
bills quite a decent shot , and bundle likes him .
me , i am convinced it is the truth , said m .
thats good hearing .
just a minute , said the pseudo duke .
i hope youll understand how it is , colonel weston (that is the name , i think ?
he said : seems like it .
he just comes right up to everyone and talks away and takes pictures of you and , as i said to mr .
everywhere .
ruth is always changing her mind about things at a moments notice , he remarked , and then he added in a would-be careless tone : the maid didnt give anyerreason for this change of plan ?
inveterate diehards who oppose progress .
i think we can take it , he said gravely , that mrs .
now then , sir , ' he looked at japp .
yahmoses voice dropped to a low , terrified whisper : and then she called out what did she say ?
all sorts of things you get sent , and the press comes round and theres pictures in the paper , and they do say as her majesty sends you a telegram .
the young woman who had just got out of the car came to the rescue .
i met her here for the first time .
well , its inclined to go sugaryunless you use cooking cherries , morello cherries .
i remember reading something about that in the paper .
she studied her appearance in the mirror with satisfaction .
so awful , she murmured .
because , said rudd , deaths cause complicationsand theres something else to consider .
and poor mr .
she began shivering again .
i dont want to recall past sadness , but its just that i dont want to feel that rosemary is completely forgotten .
surely you see it is so obvious .
there was no one i could appeal to for help without giving myself away to them , and if i risked it and failedand mrs .
it was a question , and rather an audacious one , and hilary wondered a moment or two later whether she had been wise to ask it .
they are quite divergent .
your father , charles , knows exactly whats been going on in my mind .
curiously enough , his first feeling was one of repulsion .
one knew pretty well where one was ; that was always a blessing .
step inside the lift .
you frighten me , she said .
id rather like to learn greek .
very tactfulnothing at all hinted .
ohgoodim starving she paused in the doorway .
im not really surprised , you know , said sally slowly .
miss morley replied acidly : as well as you can ever hope to get on with an irishman !
aristides , with a wave of the hand , but it is an adventure of the spirit you have passed through , is it not ?
you will be allowed access everywhere .
three at _num_ : _num_ p .
he is so frightfully discreet .
do call me lucy .
i feel a tinge of cooking might be induced in mary .
your ingenuity leaves me spellbound !
whats the matter with your throat ?
hes a very old friend , said virginia , smiling at anthony , with a mischievous glint in her eye .
it would if hinch had really murdered murgatroyd , said patrick triumphantly .
some known , some unknown , but felt .
this placid way of taking things did not quite commend itself to me .
her only chance was so to lull his suspicions that he would leave her alone for a few momentslong enough for her to get to the telephone in the hall and summon assistance .
carmichael gathered his striped skirts about him and went up the slippery stone steps to the wharf above .
then , after the clothes , her store-room was attacked .
such details as there were , were meagre and unsuggestive .
she was a good girl , rose was .
therefore that leaves us with the choice of four people .
shook him up a bit , didnt it ?
it will be wiser not to send anyone direct from the office .
miss mylecharane and myself have already discovered the first treasure .
you see , i have the good information got .
i didnt get out until past four , and what with the shops being so full just before christmas , and one thing and another , i didnt get back until after six , but the poor fellow had been quite comfortable .
its no business of his , said harold angrily .
you propose to live there .
the anguish in his tone was dreadful to hear .
the only person to gain by her death was the ladys husband , it seems .
vera stirred in her chair .
poor major burnaby will probably plunge into a snowdriftor if he doesnt hell die of the cold and exposure .
she was startled .
the brooms were admired , they were very small miniature brooms , and on the whole the decorating of them had not reached a very high standard of merit , which makes it easier , said mrs .
twenty were in ittogether bridget sat for a minute motionless beside him .
yet it is very simple .
now she really frightens me .
it is fairly certain now that the comrades approached angle mory and offered her a huge sum if she would aid them in their plans .
ive had the main facts from mr .
you may smile , he said , but i do .
why not , i say ?
now dont protest .
i was a stranger in an alien atmosphere .
there was something uncanny and frightening about it .
dont think for a moment that wethat sheever thought of getting rid of rex fortescue .
where were we ?
the inspector then showed us various enlarged photographs of the fingerprints , and proceeded to become technical on the subject of loops and whorls .
here we are !
im a betting man .
thats more or less right , isnt it ?
find out position of vyses firm .
his affirmatives and his negatives were always quite impossible to miss .
near the window there was a large cupboard .
you know what these children are .
i live for my darlings , said mrs .
kennedys word for it that halliday ever had that hallucination .
it was like a recurrence of my childhoods experience , when i had heard mother and father talking together about money difficulties , and had pranced down happily to announce to the household below stairs that we were ruined .
he went on : there is nothing else ?
that the jaguar was deliberately meaning to run her down ?
why wed all have enjoyed making father stump up a bit to give her an allowance and send the boy to a decent school .
poirot , said race , if theres anything to be found here , for gods sake go ahead and find it .
poirot and his companion .
the mysterious madame daubreuil _num_ .
you can easily in some detective stories that are written .
suddenly poirot uttered an exclamation .
optimistically , as the car gained speed , she changed up into third , and immediately the car slackened .
were all in the same boat .
she was used to illness and used to looking after the old lady .
julia ?
that the scar tissue was comparatively recent .
of course you know it isnt the ordinary reaction .
renata zerkowski sat exactly opposite him .
a private secretarywith practically no means of his own .
or had you a purpose ?
she would feel quite differently about it in the morning .
heres your scarf , mrs .
when the tall woman came , he said , tea , pleaseanderhot buttered toast , oror cake , or something .
eversleigh was in a dilemma .
even so , sir , there would have been certain soundsa choking noise , a drumming of heels on the door no .
what are you whistling for ?
that is , i believe , the modern tendency , said miss marple .
he was absolutely rabid on the subject of the redemption of young criminals .
you dont care about gerda dont be stupid , john .
blatt , there is reason to believe that mrs .
miss marple , after exchanging various conventional remarks proper to the occasion with her three hostesses , had devoted herself to her purple wool and had sat considering her next line of investigation .
i dont know what youre talking about , said percy perry .
earlier cases of assault and rape .
but you are a couple of lunatics !
neither , said poirot .
anyway , i couldnt help it if i went sick , could i ?
its all right for the young .
somebody wished to speak to me on the telephone , and the extension to my desk was out of order .
its nearer .
if a man knows hes been marked down to die , he dies .
but this is not the subject we were discussing .
big sensation !
can you tell me why you shot him ?
(i told you , hastings , everyone knew hercule poirot !
you go home , and ill send you round the dope in the morning .
inspector neele looked at her curiously .
not that im particularly well off myself , but my brother died a rich man and it will eventually come to me .
she took a sip of milk appreciatively .
he asked abruptly : have you identified the fellow ?
oh , its boscowan all right .
he turned to adam .
they suspected she was a victim of hysteria .
agreed .
and by then , you see , i simply couldnt tell gerald .
anyway , one must accept the dagger (some papers called it a stiletto !
ah , said lenox , hedging , are you ?
now let us go carefully over the renauld case from the beginning , setting down each significant point in its chronological order .
but i gather he was not in the house when this suicide happened ?
i should imagine that everyone felt that .
chapter _num_ after dinner speech the next day poirot left paris .
he knew those mothers .
colonel weston felt a kindly impulse towards her .
you did not go to her room or see her after youd left the common room ?
i have a definite sadistic delight in seeing or causing death .
do you know ii have almost a horror of her .
lorrimers case is quite different .
i give up , said mrs .
after a brief interchange of words josephine went into the house .
you do realize that her life is still in danger ?
old lady did not complain to me .
hate , jealousy , the desire to kill all rose to the surface and dominated her .
' yes , that was a bad break .
when two rubbers had been played , sir george looked ostentatiously at the clock on the mantelpiece .
i deduce from that that she is considered the most likely person to have committed the crime .
everythings very difficult , she added .
philip blake ?
one will stand a good deal from a beautiful woman , my friend , said poirot with a twinkle .
and in his usual spirits ?
the date of possessionthat will be arranged with the good mr .
youd better come by train and not by car .
out of the house came john harrison and stood a moment on the terrace looking out over the garden .
a sudden nausea seized me , and i turned blindly and ran up the stairs again towards the lift .
and for the last five years hes been in the city in a stuffy office .
hercule poirot did not answer .
suddenly , with a start , renisenb became aware that kait was looking at her , was frowning .
ah wellwhat fun it is , all the things one used to invent and believe in and play at .
hawes has a bedroom and sitting room on the first floor .
poirot replied with an air of engaging frankness : i was wondering , mr .
now what is the name of it ?
i would like to examine the ring that was stolen .
quin looked at him .
lawrence at that moment passed the door .
no suggestion of actual infidelity , but evidence of deep sympathy between them .
i can adopt a rle , i hope , as well as anyone , said poirot coldly .
edith said shed heard shed got married but she didnt know who to .
he was , then , of use to someone .
he said quietly : had your husband any enemies , mrs .
it was a justified reproach .
that , i am convinced , was why she took the coniine .
it was the same sort of evasion as we had when we were trying to find out where mrs .
is there another entrance ?
nurse hopkins said : how do you like your work ?
now that is charming , and she has some quite nice pieces .
death on the nile ( _num_ ) among the best-loved of agatha christies novels , death on the nile finds hercule poirot again trying to enjoy a vacationthis time aboard the s .
finally they went and got an oak bench and used it as a battering ram .
it was my friend here .
let us say , madame , that i intend to use not only the eyes of the body , but the eyes of the mind .
rosemary saw rather a lot of anthony browne , didnt she ?
its all that chantry woman .
humph , there you are .
it does indeed , said the old lady .
some latent patriotism must have emerged under the stimulus oferjust a couple too many .
you didnt see which of them knocked it off the table ?
it would probably be a long time before she discovered what had occurred .
though an army of reporters and photographers were being kept at bay by the police , miss marple was allowed to drive in without question , so impossible would it have been to believe that she was anyone but an elderly relative of the family .
it was robins pet delight and treasure , and the fact that it was temperamental and broke down constantly made his passion for it all the greater .
not todays , he explained .
he said : i dont knowand thats a fact .
well , i shall be in another twelve hours , so that all fits very nicely .
he pulled out drawers , opened cupboards , completely unmade the bed , and tapped the floor .
it did not occur to you to go up before and see if mr .
' _num_ ' no , my friend - something quite different .
dont you agree ?
i just felt he wasvery nice .
mathilde was still looking forlorn and forsaken , but two more things attracted tuppences attention .
a broad-shouldered , square-faced , red-cheeked , irascible looking elderly man had been pacing the floor .
hed had that but hed recovered from it , and she was , well , she was very nervy .
from a very early age he had been determined to succeed in life , and in spite of difficulties and certain initial disadvantages he had succeeded .
if you have a row with a hulking big man and hit him and he falls down and hits his head on a fenderthat isnt murder .
rosamund darnley said : nothing .
tell her that mr .
the whole thing , as reported to me , sounds quite incredible .
to hide it .
leonides request .
yes , said philip , looking at him .
it was considered advisable by the executors that hattie should be taken out in london society for a season .
coincidenceeh ?
be your age , albert , youve outgrown that sort of stuff years ago !
douglas gold , was sitting talking to valentine chantry .
as he finished his spirited narrative , the other looked up and saw a well-known face smiling at him over the conductors shoulder .
only pointed to it .
what one looks like doesnt matter .
you think you know all about me , i said .
everyone is hard on poor old franz .
you never know what would strike him as amusing .
he was involved in a train wreck a few weeks later and his dead body was found amongst others .
sir rowland shrugged his shoulders .
he gestured once more towards the hedge its a girls school now .
iii it was the day after the crime .
that is right , poirot continued .
but of course afterwards he would have studied the snapshot very carefully and would have looked at the man and tried to make up his mind whether it was just a likeness or whether it could actually be the same person .
what are murderers like ?
you know where everything in this house is , doraor you think you do , said miss blacklock , good-humouredly .
he really cared about her .
there was a third party with us , though i did not know it .
i demand that you tell me at once the name of this woman who came to visit monsieur renauld in the evenings .
after disembarking at calais and settling herself down with her maid in her double compartment in the blue train , she went along to the luncheon car .
carefully he opened the scullery door .
clarke , the relations and friends of the other victims are hardly in your sphere of life .
what on earth are you wearing ?
no , not that one , the other one .
he took the money in french notesthats why he cashed the cheque , because of his journey to paris today .
now she was given a good send-off by the assembled boarders and entrusted with various commissionsonly if you have time , of course .
not that ann was in the habit of making mistakes .
theyve both gone .
twice , at least , to my knowledge , hes got money out of her .
in a moment or two the door opened to admit a man whom i recognized as being a porter at merlinville station .
i thought you didnt think much of that theory .
she was shaking now .
he was a tall , thin man , with an air of having accompanied mem-sahibs all over the near east and knowing a great deal more about what was good for them than they knew themselves .
how long is it since the beginning of termonly a month ?
wicked it is , the way they write things , until the family could never hold up their heads again .
yes , it was he who had found the tiny dart on the floor of the car .
le marquis smiled gently .
he was examining the torn price ticket .
well , i shouldnt worry , said inspector craddock .
what i say is , why call it the _num_ : _num_ ?
parker pyne was stung to respond .
he was fairly reassured by his interview and distinctly gratified that she had noticed the birthmark .
she had fits of temper , would suddenly resent teasing and flare outand then she would be sulky for days at a time , sitting about and frowningthen again she would be in wild spirits , climbing trees , rushing about with the garden boys , refusing to submit to any kind of authority .
a good sign ?
poirot was vain enough to be pleased at the obvious reverence in her voice .
a little way along there was a door half open and from there the sounds of a bird in distress were coming .
the inspector waited calm and stolid .
ive been nervy all day .
you mustn ' t go into the sea yet .
any mother might be excused for being upset at such occurrences , but i hardly see where i can be of any assistance to you .
i do detest stinginess .
what was that reason ?
on the passenger list .
and the police are now quite convinced that he is innocent ?
oh , i was fairly agile .
schneider .
she hadnt got a hat on , said mrs .
dakin , of her journey to basrah , her employment in the olive branch , of catherines hostility , of dr .
the only drama in it was mrs .
as poirot advanced upon him , he said : yes , sir ?
a few minutes later we were out in the street again .
sarah caught her by the arm as she was darting off .
hed pitched down the stairs and broken his neck .
it was not in your car .
gwenda said : we wanted to get in touch and stopped .
whittington , said tuppence .
antheas reaction was different .
he spoke again in the same quiet , careful voice .
at kermanshah the machine came down for passport examinations and customs .
its ruth .
the doctor thought for a minute or two , then with his fountain pen he scribbled four names and addresses on a sheet of paper and pushed it across the desk to battle .
violent anxiety about the weather which in the early morning appeared capricious in the extreme .
but you dont know the real joke .
whos this etienne de sousa ?
that was an awfully jolly weekend i had with you at chimneys , said jimmy .
she said she wasnt sure that shed bother to have any lunch .
the tout ensemble , it is very good and especially , if i may mention it , your superb moustache .
iv he reached mr .
the italian general nodded his head several times .
she has plenty of time , then , to take setons letters to maggielook through them and select the few that will answer her purpose .
llewellyn-smythe died the girl went one step further and thought that she was proficient enough to make the handwriting acceptable as that of her employer .
ive got a listnow where is it ?
it was fortunate , mr .
she took an unreasoning dislike to me and insisted that i should leave the house .
she would soon have done with teaching forever .
he has been obliged to return to paris .
desultory , polite .
he saw himself with his hand on a gate .
were at the body-building stage , alexander explained .
but yes ?
i want it now when im young and strong .
i didnt say nothing at the time , said mrs .
then he started on again , and this other man started to walk , toorather fast .
we none of us wish to think it was mr .
she has never done it for money .
suddenly he looked alive and eager .
they looked at her , feeling awkward and helpless .
i couldnt afford actually to lose money .
was she justified in doing so ?
he pounced on a bundle by the door , but it proved to be only a ragged coat and trousers , and he flung it down again with a snarl .
is her accusation of rosalie otterbourne a deliberate lie ?
summerhayes , and on the following evening , he stops at mrs .
do you think i could go to bed now ?

to deceive deliberatelythat is one thing .
i should say it was almost exactly a quarter to three , i said .
i said shortly : it did .
ii ive been , i suppose , a very wicked man , said simeon lee .
allerton was standing laughing at the little nubian row of heads .
its frightful .
oh , she went off as soon as shed given me the money .
i dont really know till i get there .
cayley who had gone for a walk all round the garden .
lets give tommy a surprise !
she was out shopping early yesterday afternoon and she went for a walk to see some friends on the road past the symmingtons house the week before .
do you think i have a reason ?
a new gas ?
if i had my way id intern the lot of them .
i had only to carry it out .
surely thats a perfect alibi ?
shes no imagination , never has had .
you take my word for it , this refugee business is dangerous .
in an angry voice .
it was dusted with powder .
she was sitting with her chin cupped in the palms of her hands , and she did not turn her head or look around at the sound of his approach .
griselda is nearly twenty years younger than myself .
it sounded like a shot , said frankie .
shes doing the right thing .
i believe nothing that i am told .
one of these balkan things .
perenna had got there first .
a most interesting theory ; but it didnt happen .
well , rub it , dearie , rub it !
he said what did i really think ?
motive was always the difficultyjosie was clearly involved , but rubys death seemed , if anything , contrary to her interests .
i dont know anyone in the house yet .
take her out of herself , amuse her , interest her , and she looks a different creature !
generous with the food , but not really sportsmen !
everyone very sorry for the poor little thing .
you couldnt put anything into wood , though .
oh , isnt it frightening ?
but it happened to hit the bulls eye , said joanna .
you and your construction models !
she looked across the room at edward .
your criticism is bound to be that you yourself would have written it in such and such a way , but that does not mean that that would be right for another author .
yes , thats right .
yesterdays session with the police wasnt exactly encouraging , did you think so ?
hercule poirot said : it is not there now .
as for you , frankie , when you hear his step youd better get back on to your chair .
smashing luck for us , wasnt it ?
roberts told me to enter up a dinner appointment in his engagement book .
it was always on the cards that mr .
constance was a born match-maker , and i realise now that she produced during the course of my visits several nice and eligible men .
timothy revel as cleopatra .
now we are faced with a new problem .
for nine years sir reuben has bullied and browbeaten his secretary , and for nine years that man has endured in silence .
not much good , is it , getting all het up over things ?
a little over half an hour later came the discovery of roger ackroyds body .
i saw young mike in the street and i sent him for that father gorman at st .
oh , i shouldnt think so for a moment , said dr .
lancaster was still wandering round the room .
, she had not shown herself .
the cup used by the brighton murderer , the jemmy of a celebrated burglarabsurd childishness !
yet i knew it !
she said : you certainly know how to deal with women , m .
in that case , said giles , wed better get a weeks rent in advance .
reilly was just as nice as ever , and his house was nice too , with a bathroom and everything spick and span .
) who was this man ?
he had a little difficulty , too , at first , but at last realisation dawned on him and he said , i expect what you mean is a scorpion .
not his normal attitude .
i cant think why you wouldnt go when you were down here before .
i dont really care for money as money .
after a few unimportant questions , sir charles led the talk to the behaviour of the house party on the fatal evening .
wanted to know my viewsnot that i could tell him much .
he saw now it was a young man who stood on the other side of the hollow , framed by golden red leaves , and a young man , so poirot now recognized , of an unusual beauty .
yes , major metcalf .
we were all in hysterics !
theres no mark on her .
we didnt knowany of my friends or myselfwhat it was really going to be when it happened .
and what does this veryerdecorative young gentleman do for a living ?
and to rupert crofton lee .
so , so .
two months ago arthur became engaged to a charming girl , a miss phyllis patterson .
something is going onsomething is brewing .
his face as he looked down at her was changed , as gentle as any womans .
oh i know , edgar , but i suddenly thought it would be nice if i came along .
he gave a grim smilenothing had been touched or removed .
the anger and bitterness in her eyes startled him .
he reflected cynically that it usually was the wifeor the husband as the case might be .
he scouted the notion now as an absurdity .
hurstall explained his system of locking up the house and swore that he had found it untouched in the morning .
id gone down to take a few local shots of the mayor arriving and throwing a hoopla and putting in a peg for buried treasure and that kind of thing .
why do you think so ?
but , naturally , the police make their own arrangements .
both her pride and her good taste were offended .
any clue of that ?
hyppolitas hand was on her girdleshe was wearing nothing else .
though from what ive seen of the old boy he might easily live to be a hundred , just to annoy them all .
its the same they gave at the inquest .
we could have sold it and bought a much more manageable house .
some of these things are true , i know , said hori , slowly .
were not on those terms , said ann shapland .
i took every precaution .
her mother was an heiress of the european family of rothersteins .
i mean , she will see the news today .
she said she felt a little queer .
please stand back a little , miss neumann .
and those treesthey were splendid !
he had a reputation on the bench for being very severe .
yet with this feeling of softness , this yielding , went something elsea feeling of antagonism .
on the outskirts are some charming houses with pleasant old-world gardens .
i told her i was at the george at bartington and gave her the number .
as for the weaponwell , it might be a curiously twisted daggeror some blunt instrumenta carved stone idol poirot sighed .
it was a pleanot a question .
and then we metandand that sort of settled things .
it said be on your guard .
and during that twenty minutes inspector neele swore to himself and went out into the kitchen .
its just a question of working out where the daily women are and when the occupiers are out and exactly where theyve gone and how long theyll be .
poirot did not seem very impressed by my idea .
i looked at the window .
weve gone on , year after year .
miss batworthy , the mistress who looked after our mending was like her nameblind as a bat .
something of the most urgent , without doubt .
i want to talk to you .
or rather , what i really mean is even if we had told her so , it wouldnt have stopped her taking it if shed wanted to .
but a pleasant one , i hope .
i hope you are quite well .
far away in china , he yet controlled and directed this malign organization .
hes got an awfully silly kind of laughhaw haw hawlike that , continued bobby helpfully .
the light shifted from miss willss pince-nez , and he saw her pale-blue eyes regarding him intelligently through them .
there is no trace of them .
from the windows of the six-wheeler the three women looked out .
you havent found the skewer ?
you have returned from england then ?
tommy , let me introduce you to miss gilda glen .
she said , her brow creased : i just cant understand it !
he picked up the bunch of keys from the floor , and twirling them round in his fingers finally selected one , very bright and shining , which he tried in the lock of the purple despatch case .
it must have been someone who lived in the house and so could move about without being noticed .
thats all you feel about it , is it ?
but my life , in any case , is close to its end , and i do not want the child to suffer as i believe she would suffer if called to earthly account for what she has done .
she crossed as she spoke and stood by her friend , and just at that moment it happened !
but i did never think as how it might be a carfar less as someone was being burnt up alive in it .
if i had known - well , then naturally i would not have screamed .
poirot looked over his shoulder once at the lighted window and the profile of marthe as she bent over her work .
i thought i might as well go down to the village at once , and look up poirot ; but i met him halfway , coming up to the house , and at once gave him dorcass message .
its curious , i said slowly .
that would be a risk , of course .
im all out to be pleasant and obliging .
you know , i cant help getting a kick out of seeing you in the midst he broke off as lydia came rapidly into the room .
he was upset .
poirot opened the door and the girls climbed in .
they may have believed that mr clode had already made a will which benefited eurydice spragg and that this new one might be made for the express purpose of cutting her out as a result of professor longmans revelations , or alternatively , as you lawyers say , philip garrod had impressed on his uncle the claims of his own flesh and blood .
i am only too well aware that my french is of a painfully british order .
the weakness of the whole thing is that theyre in a cleft stick .
her broken-hearted husband shot himself .
hercule poirot sat down beside her .
i tried to see you in the hotel .
i remembered mary as she lay white and exhausted on the sofa , listening , listening .
im sure i hope theres nothing he was interrupted by the inspector .
ross said that he was .
oh , no , dont do that .
there was a new dignity in his facethe look of a man who has conquered his own baser self .
you wouldnt believe the fool things ive known women do .
yes , richard liked killing things , miss bennett admitted .
well , as long as he gets his brealffast and his evening meal all right , h doem ' t worry .
they were obtained in a perfectly legitimate way for researchmedical research , you know .
still , its nothing to do with this dreadful business .
id like one like it .
tuppence woke up .
whatever can it mean ?
the students , ah , the students , said monsieur poissonier .
she lifted her head .
im due at the hospital now , but ill come back this afternoon and make all arrangements about him .
well , i said impatiently , after waiting a few moments more .
crale when she found the body ?
let me assure you that though all these men of different ideologies arrive here and are disillusioned and rebellious , they will all toe the line in the end .
this time he kept his finger on the bell .
i was with her for four years .
said simon doyle , strolling up .
the young man , however , appeared to be perfectly serious .
and so , said poirot , twirling his moustaches , i , too , knew who the murderer of joyce was .
en voil une affaire !
its a bit of a job finding things sometimes , he said , observing my glance .
if he could find the actual weapon of the murder and at that moment , with a strange feeling of certaintyhe saw it .
climb aboard the lugger .
he was a youngish man , dark , and he was evidently badly injured , for his head was lying in a pool of blood .
oh yes , he responded .
and shed say , ive a bit of fight in me still , doctor , and hed say , thats rightthats what i like to hear .
i dont know how , said mrs .
sheer waste of time but now madame alfrege , detaching herself from the stout customer , had come down to edward and was looking at him inquiringly .
gina drew in her breath sharply .
i may be wrong about thatthough i dont think so .
do they own it now ?
miss waynfletes face lit up .
but everything !
the other evening major despard had looked as though he thought rhoda nice .
shall we run over there and have an interview with the niece of the dead woman ?
i should say he reserved judgment .
she fell in love with a boy , a young man .
she was mad with rage when he died .
i woke up from a kind of dream just outside the hotel and hurried in thinking i should be very late , but when i saw the clock in the lounge i realized i had plenty of time .
no , this is a peaceful spot .
not troubled too much by asthma , i hope ?
not only is he , perhaps , the most celebrated k .
she broke off with a little gasp as gerda christow came through the open door .
an american family .
do you know , said sarah , thats just what i thought .
giuseppe .
they hide their real selves as long as it gets them what they want .
cloade looked rather taken aback .
zlie !
gwenda glanced down at the typewritten paper in her hand on which the details of the property and the price asked were given .
my mother parted with me and i had every advantage , as they call it .
perhaps we could get marshall to come down and talk the matter over with us .
now i put it to you , ladies and gentlemen , that mr .
' ' because you could not get a reply to your knocks ?
oh , you mustnt be too modest , said tuppence .
the interesting thing is , as mr .
in an odd way , the tables seemed to have been turned .
he asked if we would like him to accompany us but i said no .
not only is truth stranger than fiction it is more dramatic .
here was , as the guide told them , the place of sacrificethe high place .
is my mind really a battleground of conflicting personalities ?
thank you , maam .
youve got a doctor in your family , havent you ?
were caught here .
the girl might know something .
satterthwaite smiled to himself .
i thought it was an accident .
so you dislike me ?
please tell your sister that i didnt know .
it was hateful of me , and i went on pretending , and afterwards i didnt dare confess that i had told you such dreadful lies .
it concerned a servant girl who had been in mrs boyntons employ .
that would be a very interesting question , said miss marple .
where did she drown herself ?
vandemeyer , stretched on the divan , looked more wickedly beautiful than ever .
no , my dear .
all members of the unit assembled in the large lecture room .
barton russell caught his glance and gently nodded his head .
no , said tommy , im nothing to do with espionage .
i didnt mean to do it , he groaned .
how did you induce pagett to engage her ?
marsh do ?
she replaced the receiver and turned to the inspector .
wickedness is wickedness and has got to be punished .
her voice was dry and hoarse .
hes been found .
you realized that there might be a large fortune to be got .
it was placed so as to cast its full light on anyone approaching from the door .
how maddening , cried tuppence .
order some turkish coffee , tommy .
just a woman .
what is strength ?
but cant i ask any questions ?
on the table beside the model were her spectaclesthe spectacles that she put on as seldom as possible owing to vanity , preferring to feel her way almost blindly sometimes , since she admitted to henrietta that without them she was so shortsighted that she could hardly see a yard in front of her .
and whilst i was observing this , the rest of the lady came into sightand frankly it was a disappointmenta middle-aged lady without charm and badly dressed .
very softly , he turned the handle of the door .
always adding to her wealth so that it was too fabulous to be believed .
name of arundell .
that woman , now , romaine heilger .
you dont know me , she said .
we want to prevent murdersnot wait until they have been committed .
her replies seemed to satisfy him .
hello , mater !
shes a marvel .
but you dont believe it yourself , do you , kirsty ?
she never knew herself how long it was before sleep overcame her .
but frankie said she didnt expect ticket collectors had any consciences .
very well , said tuppence meekly .
slowly , gwenda nodded her head .
or a word .
he might have lived even longer .
i feel no pity for her .
so much character , i always think , but i am rather afraid of her really .
possibly edward , on the advice of mr .
stone that i must have my regular times off .
mrs boynton , im going to say something rather odd to you .
thats perfectly probable .
certainly not a secret agent .
the ability to press a pair of trousers properly was , in his opinion , a rare accomplishment .
had someone been upstairsperhaps in captain trevelyans bedroom ?
i wouldnt say so before joe .
he cant imagine id fall for this stuff ?
im not sure theyre safe with me .
she was the only person who could see anything of what was happening .
i dont know that youd describe a series of peculations from a department as a confidence trick .
pikes second son .
they went down one .
nobody had any idea !
but i should solve this problem quicker if i had help , said poirot .
poirot was out .
mr lazenby looked slightly taken aback .
i can take care of myself ive been in tight places before where the hell is that revolver who took it ?
both this crime and the murder of madame doyle demanded certain qualitiescourage , audacity , bold execution , lightning action ; those qualities do not accord with a saving , prudent disposition .
and she would constantly resurrect everything he had ever said to her .
she is , i think , a very reliable woman and has been with canon pennyfather for some years .
the family looked blankly at one another .
she has always been kindness itself to me .
and daddy doesnt approve of abbreviations .
you have seen her before , i gather ?
we dont want you mixed up in any funny business .
always say they walk if theyve been murdered , but she doesnt !
there she was saying the most extraordinary things !
he might just have got off by mondays train .
and that she was beautiful .
something in his words had vaguely alarmed her .
a very happy person .
lanscombe , i suppose .
i let mild surprise show in my eyes .
it was the greatest surprise to me !
i think esa agreed to the idea of accepting kameni with two ideas in her headthe first that if yahmose struck again , it would be more likely to be at kameni than at youand in any case she trusted me to see that you were kept safe .
she was an heiress , you know .
some of his readers , he said , had thought it showed promise ; something might be made of it .
shed have been scared out of her life if shed known that id come to life again .
where could i meet you tomorrow ?
that is hardly likely .
i mean real secret stuff .
i know things happen that way ; but its usually drink and getting worked up that makes a fellow see red and run amok .
yes , i think there could be plenty of possibilities .
tuckerton liked money it stuck out all over her .
he paused in the doorway to say , over his shoulder : good show .
vincent took up her pen again , and bent over her desk .
the holidays before that i had been away on exchange on the continent , so i hadnt seen my mother and father really very recently .
at her husbands jovial : heres mr .
nicholson , and that explains how he came to find out where she was .
how is your sister , by the way ?
it was nothing to do with any of us .
but marriage was the main theme ; whom you were going to marry the big question in life .
poirot said : you will pardon me , butthe other man was , of course , mr jefferson cope ?
miss freda stanton was an extremely pretty girl of the old cornish type dark hair and eyes and rosy cheeks .
come into my room , wont you ?
no _num_ is mr .
on the fourth as arranged .
really , poirot , i said , blushing .
i suppose , said mary simply , that people like kay and ted are exciting to me becausewell , they are so different from anything or anyone that i have ever come across .
chapter _num_ after seeing miss amory out , poirot turned his attention to edward raynor .
i wonder he didnt break down completely .
she complied .
lynn , cried aunt katherine , leaning forward from the head of the table , one of mrs .
mais vous tes trs bien ici , said poirot , as he greeted her .
is that the one who was a canon at anchester ?
he had read for a whilea very interesting pamphlet lately publishedprhistorische forschung in kleinasienthrowing an entirely new light on the painted pottery of the anatolian foothills .
then he went out of the window , and she fastened it after him .
croft nodded her head in quiet understanding .
he had been under water for half an hour .
but this gentleman is superintendent battle of scotland yard .
he hadnt even lain down on the bed .
kameni was going on eagerly .
we want intelligent demonstrations .
he was getting on for forty , you know , and hed been married a good many years .
with time and patience , said miss marple , we may find out a great deal .
but what was i saying ?
the interruption seemed to disconcert evesham .
you have made the progress , yes ?
have you rung her up ?
what about the warning of the spirits ?
we walked slowly down the winding road on which so many car accidents had happened .
we proceeded on our way till we came to a spot near the hedge , halfway across the field where the body had been found .
and i told her , and she said well , perhaps i ought to tell , but anyway i said id better wait a bit , and she agreed , because neither of us didnt want to get frank carter into trouble if we could help .
well , we wont say whether thats nature or my pills , said dr .
thats true , said evesham .
raymond said quickly : oh , yes , i know that that is easy enough to say .
no , said tuppence , i must admit that i didnt .
now thats all right .
he followed the girl into the inner office and sat down at his desk , whilst she took a chair facing him .
anyway , fortunately her unsatisfactory husband died ; drank too much at a party one night and stepped in front of a bus .
her answer , given mechanically , threw a light upon the situation .
almost as good as being knighted or having a medal .
he saluted race and said : quite right , sir .
there was no denying that the queer little man had sharp eyes .
and thenyou hear of the pale horse .
plastered with mud from head to foot .
and ive got to meet them , i suppose ?
that is valuable testimony coming from an outsider , said poirot politely .
i know very little of loops and whorlssee , i confess my ignorance frankly .
he looked at it with surprise , for he knew quite well that it had not been there earlier in the morning .
a nice woman .
conservative type .
went off to australia , if im any good at guessing .
she is inclined to give herself airs because her sister married out of her station .
only unfortunately i couldnt make her hear .
clear these murders upcatch whoever is responsible for themand well be all right .
he had always felt that from the first moment when he had taken the photograph from alan carstairs pocket .
what an extraordinary thing !
you havent got any luggage , little midge .
shell be all right .
i thought that monty ill would be just as difficult as monty well .
in a moment or two he roused himself , and went on with his investigations .
i would never have dared to ask her if she hadntvery fortunatelyasked me .
roberts , the lift man , will take you up and introduce you ; but im afraid you wont find anything thats of any use .
snell coughed .
the chevenix-gores are all arrogant as the devila law unto themselves .
that seems to me very strangeconsidering the mess she was in .
poirot , said crome .

he copied her gesture and he , too , said heil !
he was too youngfar too young to bear all she gave him to bear !
you search where you please , she said , but here , no !
colonel race made a gesture with his hand .
treves eye , interestedly speculative , rested on the window , then his irritation returned to the dancers .
stayed at home with her in the evenings , he did .
but i admit to recollections of the boer wari should do , my brother fought in it .
it was almost a cry of despair .
as i say , almost i am disarmedbut not quite !
there was a time , remember , when bells and motley were more common in england than they are nowadays .
they were trying to trace him .
tommy , on the point of hailing it , changed his mind .
my word , how she ran !
there were beads of perspiration on his brow .

miss marple reflected with a qualm that joan must now be close on fifty .

so youre not dead , miss tuppence , anymore than that tommy boy of yours was !
welmans mind at rest as soon as possible .
swore at mrs .
and theres only one reason there could beto confuse the identity .

my engagement ringa couple of brooches .
so , in fact , one of the two is lying , said poirot , thoughtfully .
quin is vouched for by an expert , said his wife .
betty murdereditswell , you know what i meanit doesnt seem real .
you will find it written down in a small notebook he carried in the pocket of his dressing gown .
people do say all sorts of things , and mr .
extraordinarily elusive .
morley was against him and trying to separate him from miss nevill , but of course she wouldnt hear a word against him , and quite right too we thoughtemma and me , because you couldnt deny as mr .
your profession must be a very interesting one , said poirot .
you cannot throw any light upon the tragedy ?
but ill work the way i like and at what i likeand ill work to get somewhere .
she took miss marple into the drawing room .
he had gone through all his money and her allowance from the trust was not so very big .

we ' d better go down ax , !
now , roger , thats enough .

he strove desperately to make his voice normal .
sir rowland shook his head thoughtfully .
it was some time after we all went to bed .

for what purpose was it there ?
then there will be no stairs .
you did say nine oclock , didnt you ?
you should not laugh .
satterthwaite , cautiously feeling his way .
i shouldnt be any good at that sort of thing myself .
come on , bridget , said sarah impatiently .
she was intent on graver matters .
aye , i know thats what you say and think , but i dont know what good ambitions ever done to anybody .
who could have killed him ?
i rather like cheekfrom a pretty girl .
robin shot a dissatisfied glance at her .
why are we doing this ?

but you were actually in england on july _num_ th , i think .
lady cooteplease the poor boy , said lady coote in a motherly fashion .
how do you think , he asked reproachfully , that im ever going to be able to prove all this ?
only once did she strike , and that for a reason i simply could not fathom .
if you were a slave , victoria , said edward , i should free you and take you into my haremover there , he added gesticulating vaguely at a pile of debris .

round by the stables .
lunch , miss beddingfeld ?
there had been pictures of her in many papers , and several fictitious stories as to her origin and history .
its after breakfast , said bundle .
michael weyman gave a whistle .
she had been replaced by an elderly nannie , who was always known between ourselves as cuckoo .
and youre the west end ?
i dashed some brandy into a glass and brought it .
so good of you to come .
miss celia ravenscroft ?
the american laughed .
ah , but we are quits on that ; you , too , did me a good turn .
i wished to see her before i went , to assure her of my unchanging devotion .
she is a lady by birth , of course , and one feels its ones duty to do something for these poor young war widows .
thats partly why i was anxious to hear what you said .
you have brains , madame .

i am interested only in the time of day they were made .
i would earn money for both of us .
i shant breathe a word ofof anything she ended a little lamely .
richard went on talking .
i expect it went off by accident .
in a flash he understood her look of fear , her glance back at the house .
it was extremely unlikely that albert would have any knowledge of itindeed , it would have been fatal for tuppences plans , since the badge in question was the device of a local training corps originated by the archdeacon in the early days of the war .
i suppose there wouldnt be on a gravestone .
presently he isolated two phrases .
now , victoria thought , i must hurry , before the light goes altogether .
they were married and you were born there .
the lights went out and so did the electric grill .
you go back to furrowbank , letting yourself in quietly with your key and you help yourself to a scarf of your sisters , you take one of her lipsticks , and you also proceed to make up your face in a highly theatrical manner .
lets go , said sybil .
exclaimed inspector japp .
i felt that he was looking at the case from some peculiar angle of his own , and what he saw i could not tell .
mind you , he was a character .
the nurses eyes took in the bentley , the lilies and frankie with intense interest .
what the devil do you want ?

clipp with her toilet on the following morning .
it was a sound in the shop below .

its stealing upon me now .
lavington gave the girl a keen scrutiny as he acknowledged jacks hurried introductions .
yes , i said encouragingly .
but she wouldnt be a rich wife unless miss blacklock died before mrs .
when i came in with the sherry i found joanna had begun doing her stuff .
we fancied that nicholsons explanation of his wifes absence would be sure to make you suspicious .
jones of having murdered his wife .
be quiet , tommy .
apparently glimpsing something outside , starkwedder suddenly beckoned to laura to join him .
i told myself that i must have had some kind of hallucinationand felt generally rather ashamed and a bit of an ass .
hed have to get down to things soon , he supposed .
its not uncharitable , said miss prescott , acidly .
i am sure that things couldnt be as serious as that .
it is easy because i am a foreigner .
oh , we know all about you , dr .
the party proceeded slowly , since doctor carver walked with his eyes bent on the ground , occasionally pausing to pick up small objects .
all i can tell you is , it wasnt me !
i had no ideawell , really , i must say im very surprised you thought she would not have mentioned it to anyone ?
she arrives from middlingham with all the compromising items in her possession .
it begins to look rather bad for young charles .
how long did the interview last ?
satterthwaite had started forward .
there was a big pile of tinned food in the larder .
derek kettering grinned .
i was by now completely fogged .
poor old man .
this was what i called one of poirots irritating answers .
miss lawson was indignant .
horrified , clarissa seized the child by her arms .
he looked much older than when mr .
someone moving about in madame doyles cabin .
she understands that .
i could hear elsa and amyas talking as he painted .
remember the borgias ?
his voice dropped to a whisper .
what are you driving at with all this ?
you have had the house long ?
she offered poirot tea which he refused .
i departed for my tools , and took care to return with them at an hour when i knew i should have the field pretty well to myself .
he sat and mary dove sat opposite him .
then she said : i dont think wed care to divide up .
prison , i believe .
roberts must be a better doctor than most , said battle genially .
it is , i believe , a most handsome property .
the first steps are already formulated .
who plays bridge ?
so she had problems too .
what do you keep in your desk ?
that is definitely my view , said gilchrist .
poirot , i really am disappointed with you .
that was my meaning .
do you know , pam , i think youve got the measles .
with her foot she nudged her sleeping companion in the ribs .
the other was a fighter .
a final convulsion lifted her from the bed , until she appeared to rest upon her head and her heels , with her body arched in an extraordinary manner .
geraldine mary alexandra brown .
jolly difficult , remembering things , what ?
of course hed remember you , said bunch .
macfarlane will come back to lunch with us .
my curiosity is roused .
i find that you were not at bournemouth that weekend .
it would be one of those grand placesall for the antique .
its a kind of recipe book , pippa explained .
i sighed .
miss howard produced the letter written to her by mrs .
i effaced myself by taking an upright chair near the door .
i always think of her as i saw her then , absorbed heart and soul in clothes , her lips carelessly throwing out the words that were to influence poirots further actions , her mind concentrated firmly and beautifully on herself .
she never drank spirits or beer , and he had never realized that her passion for eau de cologne had had any other origin than her vague explanation of headaches .
why cant we keep some ice down here ?
my reasons are a little difficult to explain , though i assure you that i have reasons .
once its known i wouldnt give thathe snapped his fingersfor the life of those two girls .
you are on the wrong trackthe wrong track altogether .
my dear fellow , thats just what i want .
it is unfortunate .
but its haunted me ever since .
you dont know how miserable ive been !
and you want to know whether they were true or were not true ?
robert henry .
do you think i could have a new tennis racquet ?
he looked across at diana .
i think that , from a victorian point of view , this means that a person of her own name was indicatedand preferably a man .
i started to earn my living .
every minute is of value .
we will call it the tuesday night club .
poirot sighed in an exasperated fashion .
well , theres the cause of all the trouble .
her dear old master dead , and she no doubt brooding and feeling herself suspected of .
the big coolie hat she threw into the river , then she changed into her hiker dress and makeup , packaged up her cyclamen georgette dress and high-heeled shoes in the rucksackand presently an italian student from the youth hostel joined her dutch acquaintance at the shows on the lawn , and left with her by the local bus as planned .
we are not going to london todaynor yet tomorrow .
thank you , alice .
welcome , im sure .
well , i didnt actually go to hounslow .
pilar laughed , her teeth showing white and even .
i dont hold with gossiping about my cases .
no .
they walked in silence towards the house .
you told me that she admitted to you she was in love with george .
of course , jane dear .
i faltered .
or maynt i ?
he sat there thinking of his father with mingled affection and exasperation .
no , no , my dear lady .
he added : iris marle told me , in front of mrs .
things have happened to youwill always happen to you .
and if you havent got anything to drink with you , i shall die of thirst , she said .
but i couldnt let her take the risks she wanted to take .
his tone in a moment had a sudden acid sharpness .
get some sticks .
bodiesarranged on slabslike butchers meat !
his mind went on to the two women in the house , the tight-lipped old maid and the girl .
it is truly horrible , is it not ?
she said : but thats awful !
i discovered the bathroom to be of a semi-western , semi-eastern type , and managed to turn on some hot water , which , as usual , came out in clouds of steam and frightened me to death .
she was an old lady , and might possibly have forgotten the former one ; orthis seemed to him more likelyshe may have had an idea that it was revoked by her marriage , as there had been some conversation on the subject .
scotland yard , i fear , is not making much progress with the case , he said .
iii one of the girls rose at once as he entered the office .
he said to himself : soshe is in love and she cannot easily conceal the fact .
i wonder !
none of it seems to fit with what i know of the family .
he said uncertainly : ii dont know .
but she is in south america .
i withheld from you knowledge that i had myself .
i believe that is the name .
i think we ought to clear this matter up , said the inspector .
phillpot was very knowledgeable about period furniture and silver and things of that kind , not because he was artistiche was entirely a sporting manbut simply because he knew .
whereupon griselda sat up and tried to look dignified and more what a vicars wife should be .
there is a further truth , i think , that you have not yet recognized .
you mean the doctor infected the shaving brush ?
i was quite surprised .
so im thankful to have a distraction , and especially such an exciting one .
oh , impossible !
why are you all in the dark ?
the chef de train left the carriage .
but it would be nice in a way to keep it to the same people weve had here for the murder .
eh bien , this young lady , she has a friend , and the friend , he has put through several very questionable transactions .
when the waitress had taken the order and gone away , we looked across the table at each other .
just saved bland from going bankrupt , i believe .
she said she didyesbut that was to save the man she loved from the guillotine .
my friend poirot , exact to the minute as usual , was just tapping the shell of his second egg .
then presently as he fell silent she asked : what are you thinking about ?
all the same he scratched his head again .
well then , you see , you are talking nonsense .
and theres a careless brilliancy about her guesses .
i wonder if miss russell has had her handkerchiefs starched !
a strange feeling stole over colonel race .
to make up ones mind on that point one would have to see major rich .
violets were mauvei could match the shade of mauve on my palette , and i would then paint the violets a flat mauve .
were not going to play the murder game , are we ?
yes , there is something not quite right about mr .
eri dont know your name .
as i told you , _num_ is occupied by a local builder .
no boy ought to keep on being tied to his mothers apron strings .
here he walked round in circles for some minutes studying the shingle attentively .
so there remained only two possibilities .
ive been up for hours .
that woman could get me where she wants me any time , but , as i say , youve got to stand up for yourself .
he had the best chance hed ever have that night .
poirot murmured : you said that mr .
it was fairly obvious , said the other .
conrad entered .
he drew out the scrap of paper as he spoke , and brought it over to the light .
it must have been about the third or fourth move when wilson suddenly fell forward over the table , stone dead .
why did she wish to travel by air , anyway ?
one must think , plan the campaign in every detail .
heres one more of us whos been proved innocenttoo late !
doctor haydock nodded .
that doesnt lie amongst my duties .
arden paused .
in her excitement miss lawson very nearly went headlong down the stairs .
he leered at herthough i wouldnt let my wife hear me say so .
one finds them , on the whole , refreshingly free from the brainstorms of their husbands and their husbands colleagues .
poirot , with his card , and a suddenly bullying manner , soon fought his way into the managers office .
there were some pleasant shady trees , a virginia creeper running up the side of the house , and two monkey puzzles gave an exotic air to the scene .
tries to scratch her eyes out .
theres something wrong with this door , she exclaimed , turning to face the others .
what are you going to do , micky ?
oliver moved on towards the house and poirot and the dispirited architect prepared to follow her .
its rather a funny business , one way and another , but i dont see how it affects the main issue not at present , that is .
she said slowly : i was afraidof something happeningto mr .
asked anthony irritably .
it was wickedly expensive and what nourishment could there be in it ?
good lord , whats this ?
er royde , put in mary .
what do you make of this , my friend ?
he is one of the pres blancs in carthage .
a tall man , with a buttoned-up overcoat and a soft hat .
any faint hopes of even putting up a good show deserted me , and having reached that pitch i became much happier .
perhaps mrs .
they were stained a deep brownish redthe colour of dried blood .
then she burst out again : ive tried so hard tokeep everyone from knowingit isnt really her fault .
of course there was good money to be got just then .
better ask the otherstheyd know more than i would .
delangua came over to her , lauralaurawhy did you do it ?
was it dropped by colonel arbuthnot ?
he was irritable , nervous .
poirot said slowly : i have the facts , yes .
oh , i dont think theres any danger of that , mr .
the frenchman was less interested in sarahs medical achievements than in the black hair that rippled back from her forehead and the beautifully shaped red mouth .
i mentioned him , i think .
i was frankl bored and glad when poirot took his departure .
it was in the beer , wasnt it ?
and then actually at the airport we didnt leave until eight .
now , when i say a few years ago , i mean quite a lot of years .
yes , very bad luck .
ive just this minute had a telephone call through from the chief constable about you .
we pretended it was our own house .
parker pyne saw the quickly concealed tremor of her lips , but immediately she recovered and discoursed pleasantly on the above-mentioned subjects .
i like appearing from nowhere .
they were always aloof .
it is not mine , monsieur .
the tilted forward hat , the hat attached airily to the back of the head , the beret , and many other styles .
naturally there is no such person .
when i arrive he is lying on the floor in a faint .
only not in the same way .
she does not tell lies .
its a damned lie !
across a chair in the middle of the room was the foamy pink dance frock ruby had worn early in the evening with a pair of pink satin high-heeled shoes kicked off carelessly on the floor .
in the morning he talked to her , told her bluntly that major halliday had killed his wifethat major halliday was insane , and that he , kennedy , was hushing up the matter for the childs sake .
the fair plaits , the spectacles , the lisle thread stockings , the dental plateall that can go into a small space .
bantry at first thought to be the ugliest man she had ever seen .
silent appreciation of food filled the next three minutes .
i ' ve got two .
i think that there was one outsider who knew , who was here at the time that this happened .
with the suddenness of a conjuror , he produced a sheet of paper covered with writing .
a great steaming cauldron on a fire , myself being thrust into it .
lorrimer shrugged her shoulders slightly .
and what could be more fascinating than this ?
that sort of thing .
her mother looked at her reproachfully and murmured : we should have to come to some financial arrangement , of course .
i was forced to tell him that in my view there was nothing to be done .
all clemencys hopes and plans were frustrated .
accidents do happen .
he was poisoned with hyoscine , richard continued .
satterthwaite was taken at once to margery gale .
believe im going to meet you tomorrow up at the manor .
just gone out this minute through the window , said ronny .
wool disappearingred silk curtainsit doesnt make sense .
the doctor said brusquely : how did she know about them ?
and after that meeting , one more evil chance (from your point of view) occurred .
theyre not just whitetheyre green .
you wouldnt want me to run away from her , would you ?
but shes dead .
on d deck .
youre not really interested , said tuppence coldly .
ii it was like a dream , renisenb thoughtthe boat and the sail and kameni and herself and teti .
id like to strangle that woman with my own hands .
so all is settled , and i and miss pettigrew go off into the blue together .
although satisfactory so long as any weight problems were thereby solved , the pleasures of this kind of breakfast were not much appreciated .
can i speak to you a moment miss crackenthorpe ?
then she looked long and earnestly at her face in a small mirror and touched it up here and therea little powder , more lip salve .
you will find her , you mean ?
im right .
yes , i think she has secrets from her husband .
have you been having a bad time ?
after all , we do stand for justice , dont we ?
and then arlena marshall said : you blackmailing brute !
no , it wasnt .
are you sayingdo you meanthat this was a premeditated crime ?
thats quite true , but he walked up through the park , and mr .
in fact , really rather fun .
bron ?
he was conveyed across the channel by destroyer .
but they said that his own wife was passionately in love with him , that she had gone against all the wishes of her powerful family in marrying hima mere nobody with political ambitions !
monsieur poirot says that that does not really matter .
the lady i mean is tall and fair with reddish gold hair and thats er , said the porter .
in the old days when all the family was at home , it was happy then ?
entwhistle stiffly .
well , i mean , i got so thin i was wasting away .
for nearly a year she had deliberately tried to put the thought of rosemary away from her .
miss marple coughed and murmured : i should imagine , though perhaps i am wrong , that there may have been what we might call family reasons .

with characteristic candour mark had gone straight to the heart of things .
miss springer was not sensitive .
oh , archie , why ?
ah , you have comeit is good of you .
oh well , it was always used to be called that .
poirot gave a sympathetic murmur .
simon went into ecstasies over mrs spragg .
hubbard , true to her lemon blood , was unperturbed .
well , the war didnt go that way .
as i pointed out , it wasnt usual and might cause inconvenience .
for the moment well leave this room exactly as it is .
ive got the key in case we want to go inside .
im free .
you shouldnt do it , at your age .
why should you think anything had happened to mr .
i dont think i realised in the least at the time what poor grannie suffered , but now i have a clear picture of her sitting helpless and half blind in the middle of her possessions and everything that she prized , while all round her were three vandals , rummaging in things , turning things out , deciding what to do away with .
and if its really money he wants , it would be important for gina to get all the money before sheerdefinitely forms an attachment to someone else .
i forget his last name .
leaman said poirot , writing down the name .
for the moment , that is the best i can do for you , mon cher .
i like her better .
he noticed that the train was at a standstillpresumably at a station .
greta came and stayed with us for a weekend .
her strength was the strength of the insane .
roderick down .
its a solemn thought .
thats been pretty clear , i think .
and then he got fond of me and asked me to marry him and i thought , well , really thats a far more sensible revenge than anything else .
aye , aye , commander , he said .
harter leaves everything to her niece , miriam harter , now miriam robinson .
she is , i believe , considered a very good writer , said poirot .
he got off at the pine ridge caf where hed arranged to meet his wife for tea .
osborne was made of different mettle to tony of tonys place .
the usual pause happened .
in a minute the woman would return and then he stopped dead with a muffled cry .
no , he shouted .
if youll give me a chit , sir , id like to go and see some top brass .
lie themselves black in the face for the sake of a man .
going to france , arent you ?
once , went on miss pierce conversationally , i remember tearing up a pound note that waynot thinking of what i was doing .
renisenb thought : there is kameni .
that is nearly eighteen years ago .
also immediately .
cartwright on the telephone .
there is no reason at all to believe that he was murdered !
oh , well , you see , its supposed to be all right .
yes , that would be the natural thing to do .
bouc bent a suspicious glance upon him .
now , in the seclusion of her bedroom , she unwrapped that final purchase .
however , well see .
must have been a near miss , he said grimly .
i told you , he said , murder is my business .
this crime has a signature and it is certainly not the signature of colonel arbuthnot .
there were just one or two little points , you know , that i wanted to verify .
the library (and the encyclopdia britannica) had not been the sanctuary he had hoped optimistically it might be .
in very bright scarlet .
s (keen on wallers) , who were all to a girl in love with lewis waller in monsieur beaucaire .
the marchese di san veratrino was fortunate .
look at the remarkable way they remember names and faces .
i opened my door , continued mary , and listened .
there is a proverb or a saying .
and perhaps sometimes , she will be too sure .
i felt the occasion could not pass without a protest , i said .
clearly , if she had got it from any other country , it dated from some period when they had been copying egyptian work .
something id forgotten , said beryl gilliatt .
yahmose studied her for a moment before saying : yes , henet .
cigarette ash and footprints ?
said george placidly .
well , i have heard something .
i do not think that either before or since i have ever suffered as i suffered then .
having dismissed the last patient , i strolled into the little room at the back of the house which i call my workshopi am rather proud of the home-made wireless set i turned out .
you were duly captured .
in my beginning was my tragic end ?
but we did see clearand there wasnt any doubt .
the kitchen garden , perhaps , but thats very close to the gardeners cottage .
you must see that .
but when i was seven and joanna two , we went to live in london with an aunt , and thereafter our christmas and easter holidays were spent there with pantomimes and theatres and cinemas and excursions to kensington gardens with boats , and later to skating rinks .
had that anything to do with it ?
no , im not laughing at you , hester , said philip gently .
that is one thing i am quite sure of .
said battle curiously .
it struck me as odd that she should always telegraph , not write .
we just found him , you know .
ive never been anything more than mildly left-wing .
are you sure it wasnt because she was depressed and uncertain about her future ?
look here , ive been round to hoffberg , and they know nothing about that man of theirs last night , or the wire either .
it is usually said that a rich man labours under the belief that he can buy everything and everyone .
yes , indeed , dear master .
i thought of it !
my dear child , the question is , will you be allowed to forget about it ?
were you at home yesterday afternoon , may i ask ?
it was just twelve oclock when i was awakened by the sound of the front door being slammed to and knew mr .
he had remained sitting out on the terrace alone after everyone else had left .
did she give a reason for wishing to see me ?
such a passion for his work .
countered miss marple .
so many girls were fetched away this morning , and there were so many gaps at table , that half the school could have been missing , i think , without any apprehension being aroused .
i like to enjoy myself , and i like everyone around me to enjoy themselves as well .
upon his knock there came a sudden silence , then the sound of a chair being pushed back along the floor .
in the kitchen as kitchen-maid .
we can all work ourselves up to believe that weve seen more than we have .
whats up ?
and nothing do i eat that i have not cooked myself .
i always bring two glasses , sir , said parker .
may be a catalogue somewhere .
albert will be handing them out the stuff about my being engaged with scotland yard on the phone .
he was a banker originally , i think .
i must do them again .
he supposed ' well , we get nothing of interest there , mon am/ , ' said poirot as we left the house .
of course , its possible one of the servants may be concerned , eh ?
oh , it is easily done .
you have a dominion complex !
we were sitting on one of the terraces of the majestic hotel .
henet bridled .
she had been told that her godfather was coming to see her .
he was talking to mecurse him .
needless to say , i accepted with alacrity .
then he turned to face mrs warwick and , trying to draw her out , asked , did richard have anything on him ?
what have we here , my dear miss amory ?
she handed phillipa the letter she had received .
flat contradiction .
' she said with malicious intent , and smoothed back the lock of hair to await the result .
not relabelled ?
she went to the wash place at the back .
colonel johnson said : do you know that those diamonds have been stolen ?
only , i suppose , to someone who had an alibi for that time .
i was furious .
said poirot , calming down .
by jove , it had been a near thing , though .
that most unaccountable of children , instead of being upset , merely grinned broadly .
you see , my friend , it is not so easy .
his imagination , which was considerable , had been exercised in devising various schemes for making money .
now please drink it .
he didnt say anything at all about my having been listeningand how he knew i was listening i cant think .
it was there , she realized , that her age told against her .
but here we have made great strides in the investigation of the subject .
superintendent harper agreed .
one of the gardeners told me something about it .
then descended once more , but diverging slightly from the path .
he looked tired and haggard .
yes , what olga was telling him now was perfectly true , and because it was true it was one of the reasons why the codicil appended to the last will properly drawn out and signed by louise llewellyn-smythe had been accepted at first without suspicion .
they were mostly uninteresting .
especially , you understand , when she has brains .
it bore a simple inscription , sacred to the memory of hugo edmund drake , beloved husband of rowena arabella drake , who departed this life march the _num_ th _num_ he giveth his beloved sleep it occurred to poirot , fresh from the impact of the dynamic rowena drake , that perhaps sleep might have come in welcome guise to the late mr .
walter , who is always there .
this child is musical .
lord caterham looked depressed again .
sounds quite promising !
goby shook his head sadly and said rather obscurely : theres one in every family .
he recovered himself , put it firmly down on the tray .
now think carefully , mrs .
loud clapping drifted up to us from the quay below where another set piece was being showna ship , i believe , with welcome to our visitors displayed across it .
inglethorp will take the last dose of her medicine .
hercule poirot did not laugh .
what does he want to know , this friend of yours ?
they stood staring at the little man with a very fierce moustache and an egg-shaped head .
thank ye , sir .
somewhere where there were rocks .
lords introduction of him had done little to soften the situation .
where were the other three ?
shes been with me for six years , said sir charles .
broadribb and schuster , solicitors and notaries public , with an address in bloomsbury .
his tone expressed professional disapproval .
oh , there you are .
she liked trying the stuff .
from woman to man , a minute and a half at the outside , probably a good deal less .
well , one day the setting of lady dortheimers diamond ring became loose and miss richards brought it up to town to have it fixed .
i know there is one place they never go if they can helpanywhere in the open air .
his mines were gold mines , but he comes into the story through his son .
if everyone hustles round and screams loud enough that the ship is sinking , it ought to be enough for an innocent young girl like jane .
naturally theyre all a good deal upset over this business ; theyre a trifle nervous and highly strung , too , you know , so if there are any arrangements to be madenecessary formalities , arrangements for the funeraltransport of the body to jerusalem , why , ill take as much trouble as i can off their hands .
magdalene laughed suddenly .
if so , i suppose i should have had to look for it and stick it on some way or otheri dont know quite how i mean , i suppose you would have to sterilise it first , or something , wouldnt you ?
harolds face brightened a little .
you dont do that if youre thin-skinned .
iii as they came into the hall , they met admiral chandler coming in .
i always like to keep an open mind .
rather an expensive way of doing things .
twenty-seven i the coroner cleared his throat and looked expectantly at the foreman of the jury .
straight down this hill and then , as you see , the road gives a sudden very sharp turn round that bulging bit of wall .
he could also dope himself after successfully committing the burglary .
and he said it wasnt his fault , and i said that was a likely story , and then he said hed got a bit of a lark on that nightand that he wasnt going to be out of pocket by it and how would i fancy a wristwatch ?
naturally wed have checked that postcard if it hadnt been for the martine business fitting the bill so well .
as the little group hesitated in the doorway , tim allerton rose from his chair nearby and came forward .
but i ask you this , my dear fellow .
to begin with , the makers of modern motorcars assume that only a pair of sylphlike knees will ever be under the steering wheel .
viii hugo lemesurier died a few months later in the private asylum to which he was removed .
ive lost my spectacles again , she said , but it doesnt really matter .
well , thank you , sir , for the suggestion .
as to the other business , went on japp .
he had with him a tall , dark young man whom miss waterhouse did not bother to greet .
i followed nash into the little morning room and he shut the door .
im suggesting thaton some occasion mrs .
being up in the air has done me good .
fish also watched them .
hi , what was that ?
miss griffith said , theres his own doctorhe must have a doctor .
so it was your idea ?
a wonderful person to read nowadays .
as a matter of fact i came to suggest that you should come and pay me a little visit .
we had a very cheery tea , and assisted cynthia to wash up afterwards .
i quite understand , miss mcclelland .
never have i seen such a ghastly look on any mans face .
its been in the chandler family since the time of elizabeth .
jim and i , weve talked about it a lot .
they have come to live as a family there and they are happy .
can you remember if there were any letters among her personal possessions ?
miss bligh ?
but now that was overshe had failedor succeeded ?
you did your best , said the chief constable .
i was sure enough , and another incident in crossing the street not long afterwards made me surer still .
painted by augustus john .
hercule poirot slowly nodded his head .
whether miss marple had been looking for him or not , she was now fully engaged talking to mrs .
well , of course thats true .
mademoiselle is the genuine article .
im coming up tomorrow for an appointment with the dentist .
bit of an oversight here , thought bobby with a grin .
allow me to interest myself in my coffee cups , and i will respect your cocoa .
he added that he was on his way to catch a train .
youve been wonderfulsimply wonderful .
my face showed my shocked reaction .
the day before i went back to england i had a long conversation with mr .
a ladys room in every sense of the term .
perhaps he believed at first he could influence mrs .
and i think , gwenda , that that is why your childish impression of what you saw remained so strong .
tommy shrugged his shoulders .
' i suggested doubtfully .
nobody believes it .
shut up , kay .
will he be at home , do you know ?
eryes , sir , i thought id better .
one thing was clear .
its so much more likely to be the other way about .
eleven oclock .
carter i guessed what was up .
well , i had better tell miss marple just what we have arranged .
the dead are past that .
scott seems to be very charming , said mr .
i think theyre right .
he wanted brenda .
sixteen race pored thoughtfully over a plan of the promenade deck of the karnak .
pretty cool thing to do .
i had no time to develop farther the appalling idea that had occurred to me , for jack renauld was ushered into the room .
the thing that was hanging on a nail .
judes hospital .
just that .
it was well planned , well thought out .
i came along to you to find out .
' for a minute , i was suspicious , and he must have seen it , for he smiled .
because you didnt see mr .
a passage on the right led along to the bar , from whence a faint hum of voices could be heard .
with your ideas , said mrs .
thats what makes it so impossible .
its all right by me , he said .
occasionally in the corridor outside could be heard the rattle of glasses and instruments as a trolley was pushed by .
if i were you , said anthony gently , id come to chimneys tonight .
there was hardly a moments hesitation before she said : you really are a detective , arent you ?
poirot went on his quest .
your loving aunt , alison danby .
rafiel , with characteristic frankness .
i thought dinah might come down here after me .
she was feeling sure of herself and she wanted to assert her importance .
i had heard him discussing some letters , sir , with mr .
so one mystery , at all events , was cleared up , and the diamonds were obviously the key to the whole situation .
she actually told certain friends of hers that she was afraid of you , i believe ?
about half-past three .
he was , i think , though lonely , satisfied .
you realize that he chose the one place in the house to hide it where its presence would not be remarked ?
you dont sound mad at alljust frightened .
alphabetically i began .
did lord mayfield see a shadow ?
look , he exclaimed .
shes been kind to you , said dr .
the postmark on this letter was hampstead , but in poirots opinion little importance could be attached to this fact .
poirot and mrs .
to think of anyone dying like this away from home .
most of the way had to be across country , and the wadis and irrigation ditches were often impassable .
then who could have killed norton ?
not you , said poirot .
all greatly magnified , i see .
i dont really understand your interest .
he said : you must excuse anyershortcomings this morning .
i had johnnie with me , and he and i and the inspector went together into the room we call the council chamber .
the particulars of several were given to her , including those of the mill house .
she found the little bottle from which mrs .
he looked across the room at the arab , noting every detail of his appearancethe striped robethe old khaki tunicthe ragged hand-knitted red scarf full of dropped stitches .
a fresh piece of evidence discovered by the detectives since the police court proceedings was a long , almost new piece of blotting paper .
geoffreys only child , but she cant inherit because shes a female , and mr .
i never went near the house .
instantaneous .
merrilees looked up sharply , and then laughed .
i never dreamt hed mind or care .
i adopted j .
enjoyed yourself , poirot ?
i woke at about six with rain pouring on my face .
a winding drive led up through dense shrubbery .
but you must realize that weve got remarkably little evidence to go upon .
he murmured to himself : the fourth labor of hercules .
let me just see he resumed his researches .
i like to send round cards at christmas time to a few old friends .
and find out when someone dies or read somebodys will , look up marriages in churches or study birth certificates .
i should say it was about an hour later that i stoked the fire , quite a short time after that i fetched the drinks (next hand but one , i think) , and perhaps half past eleven when i got myself a whisky and sodabut those times are quite approximate .
that is that , he said .
thats all for now , thank you , miss grosvenor .
if its possible , id ask you to put as much bitterness as you can out of your mind and just run over the facts and times again .
is there not a saying that history knows nothing of its greatest men ?
she nodded brightly to us , then taking her husbands arm she moved off in the direction of the dining room .
or for vagueness ?
pongo , urged to bring his great brain to bear upon the matter , gave his decision .
hallo , edward .
he leaned out of the window , and gave new directions to the taxi driver , who acknowledged them with a snort of contempt .
after the accident happened he chanced to mention having seen our tommy acting very rash-likeand of course it does show that if something sudden had startled him he would have fallen easy enough .
i landed in england three days ago .
satterthwaite , that i move in english society .
so you neednt worry , victoria .
she was hit with something heavythats heavy .
i am continually active on their behalf .
and you will reply , yes , i am a manufacturer of synthetic oil of jasmine .
it was music he had heard before .
he drew on his boots and stood up .
i know of several people who suspect .
he said excitedly .
she was a small creature with black bobbed hair .
i can tell you that for a fact .
poirot gazed back at him .
we both exclaimed simultaneously .
jolly good idea .
what on earth are you all doing here ?
come and have a drink , clithering .
major allerton i instinctively disliked .
oh well , come on .
a slight dispute arose with people near her supporting the claims of electricians and the gas board .
that was an accident .
a young lady would occupy it later in the evening .
thats a very ancient one , the one that everybody understands and appreciates .
various deed boxes labelled sir john ffouldes , dec .
so faithful , so good to us all .
that ghastly night .
its our idea that grete harden is anna scheele .
he cast his nephew adrift upon the world in a few short succinct words , and then settled down to his interrupted survey of some oilfields in peru .
one even laughed .
if he suddenly found out that his uncle had been murdered within a few minutes of his leaving himafter , perhaps , a rather stormy interviewwell , he might get the wind up and clear right out .
the women are all devout a good thing perhaps .
lynn thought : this is some fantastic nightmare .
it goes to show , doesnt it ?
i received the letter written at your dictation , which was just what i expected .
on the morning that i am telling you about , i was walking along the high street , and i was praying hard .
a rolltop desk stuffed with papers , all neatly docketed , stood against the wall , and a big leather armchair showed plainly that it had been its owners constant resting place .
do you mean it ?
colonel weston asked : redferns wife is one of them , i suppose ?
looking out of the drawing-room window , through the pouring rain , we saw a particularly fine cedar tree , a cedar of lebanon .
the old womans hand closed on her stick .
leonie shot him a provocative glance .
i had nothing to do but to wait .
she said she had enjoyed the experience , but had no intention of doing any more of that silly kind of thing .
she said it with a queer intensity .
who murdered her ?
he suggested , looking hard at me .
in a leather frame was a head and shoulders of a fair-haired , smiling girl .
she left all her money to you .
she took them down , ranged them upright against the wall , and then stepped in .
the drawing-room at ealing was a wonderful period piece .
he was rudely awakened by a hand that fell on his shoulder and he was jerked round to face sergius oranoff .
the human drama , hastings !
there was a crafty look in jans eyes as he responded , was it ?
ive been afraid of this coming all the time .
naturally , it is not a matter for the police .
they could melt it down .
but there might be an off-chance that you might know something about her that he does not .
we had macaroni au gratin for supper and a custard pudding .
there , mademoiselle , if you fasten that round your throatso .
you dont say , said hailey preston , slightly ill at ease .
and now i will ask you to tell me the circumstances of her journey to plymouth and any other details that seem to you to bear upon the case .
' ' why should you think that ?
why , that will made on the afternoon of her death may but poirots shake of the head was so energetic that i stopped .
some of the walls were still hung with faded silk .
you took the hate out of yourself and put it into that little figure .
youd better go in and get it over .
i sayi hope you dont mindi rang up your detective friend , m .
obvious , my dear watson , said tuppence .
macwhirter crossed in the ferry to the saltcreek side .
little gwennie was a nice child .
shes a damned liar !
but you suspect that her death might have been murder ?
her eyes stared not quite into the camera but slightly obliquely to the left .
satterthwaite was curiosity , pure and simple .
altogether , the inspector was thankful finally to reach milchester .
her husband did not give her time to answer .
i hope you wont get pneumonia .
i was terrified .
yes , yes , paris .
' ' but why - why ?
the air felt close and oppressive , and there was an overpowering fragrance of joss sticks .
ellie jumped up and came forward and across the room .
and what i do i shall enjoy doing !
a quiet fellow , burgess , white-faced , a little weedy .
in the garden , you mean ?
my second really is the first .
thats whats so inexplicable .
you can be sure of that .
there have not been many of them , i am glad to say .
she added shyly : i have enjoyed myself , rowley .
this was news to me and glancing sideways at poirot , i fancied that it was news to him as well .
ronnie garfield looked up suddenly .
farley shook her head , and joanna farley remarked : none of us had any idea he had consulted anyone .
could you get to see it , do you think ?
if we start the car and let it run down the hill it will crash straight into the wall and something pretty drastic ought to happen to it .
is there any system behind it ?
queryhow did he get poisoned ?
miss amphrey hesitated a minute , then went out .
without doubt , he saw captain hastings and his companion leave the shed , slipped in himself and took the dagger , stabbed his accomplice in the shed who was already dead !
it seems so dreadful .
he had been severe with ce cher hastings on this point , and now here he was , behaving much as his friend might have done , obsessed with beautiful women , crimes of passion , jealousy , hatred and all the other romantic causes of murder !
i didnt handle the bottle , you see .
i went out to see her , said miss marple , and i gave her some money and told her to take a holiday and not to write home .
all quite gaga by now , i expect .
but , having once committed a murder for the first time in his life , he felt the hell of a fine fellow and began to develop ego mania as a compensation for his former inferiority complex .
ive just told you .
i think , when your children have grown up , that you should cut away from them , efface yourself , slink away , force them to forget you .
i was just about to ring .
flora accepted a chance of liberty , money and an enlarged horizon , ralph , of course , was playing a different game .
he cackled with sudden laughter .
i think there are some letters for you , frankie , dear , said sylvia .
a low voice was singing overhead : the gipsy woman lives on the moor the voice broke off .
mere chicken feed , said rydesdale .
at her age one does not have birthdays .
the manservant brought out whisky and liqueurs while the commander was still holding forth .
but i will ask you , my friend , to give me a few more hours .
i know , we had great trouble with her as she got older .
oh it was horrible .
are you shortly going to marry miss jane wilkinson ?
men arent worth anything at all nowadays .
how well she played her part !
somewhere among the two or three hundred , i supposenot that shell be able to tell you much .
the games up , frankie .
in fact , i am sure of it .
and if anyone does catch us , i shall sayi shall saythat i thought it was mrs .
this is where we thread the leaves .
the family !
i have the tickets of monsieur .
there are preparations made for you ?
theres jewellery and some furs , but i imagine very little actual cash .
tomorrow , tuesday , he and nicholson minor were going to make nitroglycerine .
waverlys emotion was obviously genuine , but it assorted strangely with her shrewd , rather hard type of countenance .
she cant quite take it in yet .
but derek was past noticing the warning signs .
yes , he was indeed fortunate in having george to look after him .
and another loh !
a man was standing there tapping on the pane , and the mystery of his arrival was explained by the fact that he wore skis .
noof course i dont .
prestcott became excited .
i shall never forgive myself .
celia looked at him with unconcealed adoration .
it displayed no embarrassment of any kind nor disturbance .
harlequin and columbine , invisible , dance in and out of the unconscious throng .
jessop moved forward .
i say , awfully modest , arent you ?
you always have .
he took the ukelele from her and removed the broken string he went out of the room holding it in his hand .
weve heard about her various activities .
really courtly .
he was an unusual man , a man who has friends and contacts throughout the east .
she realized that i was on the same track as herself when i wrote to her from the ritz in paris .
my mother was considered go-ahead to send her daughter to a boarding school , and my father broad-minded to allow it .
patrick simmons ?
according to my analysis , the dart had recently been dipped in the venom of dispholidus typus , better known as the boomslang or tree snake .
messing about with people and places that are buried and done with doesnt make sense to me .
you will understand , wells , he added , that this is all strictly private .
i was dazed .
as we reached the summit i told her her earring was loose .
i know , i said meekly .
redding what mrs .
he was troubled .
redfern at a corner .
he paused expectantly .
his whole mind was set on whether id recognized him .
i wishi wish yes ?
again incredulity shot through him .
rival slipped down from her high seat and went not too steadily towards the door .
other evenings hed send down and ask mr .
she came back with her arm ever so sore with it .
same here , agreed tommy with feeling .
jefferson .
since you were a healthy person it would not have harmed you , which is why i made you lay stress on your tubercular trouble .
i should not have known what to do through this bad time but for her .
poirot some time .
george said : but , theni dont understandi .
but rosalinds eye upon me had the effect of a medusa .
all the same , he twinkled at her , we cant expect young ladies to sit at home and sew and shudder at the idea of crimes of violence in these enlightened days .
that was very intelligent of you , mrs .
i had read the phrase or something like it in a moneylenders circular , and i was rather pleased with it .
i passed .
he said , quite belligerently .
she said quickly : wait a minute , carrie louise .
poirot , the evidence of my own eyes ' ' back my eyes against yours any day , old boy , ' put in sir i orge .
he said : i think he knew that .
wouldnt you believe me if i swore i wouldnt say a word to anyone ?
had he really been playing a part all the time ?
now about this girl , anna stravinska .
deep and slow .
six the third floor flat the third-floor flat was first published in hutchinsons story magazine , january _num_ .
im very sorry , sir .
i dont believe she ever fainted at all .
mrs clayton who was prostrated with shock had left her flat in cardigan gardens and was believed to be staying with friends .
he picked up a pin , you know .
slinking down the hall , far more like a thief than like the master of the house , lord caterham gained the shelter of his sanctum .
you could produce witnesses in support of this statement ?
i have no evidence , but i like to believe that we have a true and authentic grove of astarte here .
probability poor as regards motivegood as to means of obtaining poison .
marina marina marina always marina .
why are you talking like this ?
i think that after hed called hands up somebody came up quietly behind him in the darkness and fired those two shots over his shoulder .
it was the fear i saw on her face that told me the truth .
i had in a way known her all my life , but did not get to know her properly until i was about nineteen and had caught up with her , since she was some years older than i was .
i should have said that captain hastings was the sentimental one of you two .
i daresay i picked it up from her .
they went up to the promenade deck and started on the starboard side .
but the readers plate is full indeed , as hercule poirot must follow a familiar nursery rhyme through a course of murder .
you do too , dont you ?
your papers are in perfect orderyoull have no difficulty at the syrian frontier .
poirot motioned with his head towards the bookcase , and i obediently pulled forth whos who .
monicas nursing home , said mrs .
flora ackroyd is here , she announced in an excited whisper .
well , as you know , im deeply in your debt .
blake was in the hall and caught a fragment or two .
asking people , i suppose .
what about the ink on elizabeth johnstons papers ?
inspector curry said to alex : did you notice light streaming out from that window last night ?
it had quite slipped my memory that one of his many aliases was dacre .
she thinks of things id probably never have thought of myself .
as he did so , he dropped a piece of paper .
for some years afterwards i was always saying , oh , so-and-so happened five years ago , but each time , really , i ought to have added another five .
artist ?
parker pyne received this startling change of face without wincing .
im often very violent in dreams .
thanks , lord mayfield , i think i will .
that fragment of tablet was very promising .
he struggled valiantly , but in vain .
tommy recognized in him an irish sinn feiner .
the members of our special legion were also invited .
in the end she was summoned and told that there was a place on a plane going to dakar which normally did not touch down at casablanca but would do so on this occasion .
on the other side of the streamnext to the marquee on the leftyou and mr cope had tents .
she was smiling in her quiet way .
that makes a slight difference .
how often , for instance , one is convinced one has put an article in a certain place , later to find that you have put it somewhere quite different .
satterthwaite turned eagerly to his friend .
nice chap , but slow-thinkingand she had the sense to act quickly .
i walked all the way to ealing yesterday to see cousin charlotte green .
that is not so .
fighting .
poirot surveyed it carefully .
wings of gold , horns of gold ?
now all is silence , he creeps up to his room , and at once it occurs to him how much better it will be if he pretends never to have been near his uncle that night .
but robert has always said that ive got a great deal of common sense , of intelligence .
he stamped his feet , blew , puffed , snorted and applied a numbed finger to the bell push .
surreptitious episodes ?
a most wicked thing to do , if so .
but she was a white-skinned delicate creature .
thats because we none of us here dare talk to one another .
she sat there and time passed .
miss marple had remarkable eyesight for her age , and was at this moment taking in everything that was going on round her with keen interest and pleasure .
she leaned back , swinging one slim foot and narrowing her eyes .
im out of a job .
gudgeon right away .
entertainment account ?
no , perhaps you dont .
the pick of the bunch , he murmured , quite a little gem , isnt it ?
youre making me feel quite peculiar with shivers running up and down my spine .
youve had that already .
an intricate plot , said colonel melchett .
on the sofa ?
he referred to it after his greeting .
cried roger , springing up from his pouffe with explosive energy .
poirots eyes rose to a ledge a little way above his head .
leadbetter to himself .
next day you come and ask her questions , and shes been scared , so she wont talk .
he explained that he had arrived on the preceding tuesday , that he had handed over the manuscript in question to messrs .
the two men had not gone into a detailed account of how theorizing from an inkblot had led to the discovery .
it had been some time before she had been able to get together with miss prescott for a heart-to-heart chat .
coleman did say once himself that he would have made a good forger .
pebbles , i said , keenly disappointed .
what old lady ?
youve always cared too much about ainswick , lucy .
an overstout dumpy middle-aged womannot clevernot brilliantbut with something about her that you couldnt pass over .
evie !
not above being paid off by their fathers either .
she said : i dont understand .
that apparently childlike candour , that frank innocencewas it just that ?
hed got it all clear now .
then he reminded me of something i had said to him at manchester respecting that bogus telegram which lured miss cowley away .
let me just explain to you what we do know .
you know that unfinished letter that protheroe was writing when he was killed ?
yes , yes , i know , which theyll get when luther crackenthorpe dies .
exactly nothing at all .
still in the same impersonal manner , burgoyne proceeded to his finding of the body .
a husband and wifeattractiveestranged from each other .
hullo , said the other , whats up ?
oamitted that she did not like 	as to treclweu .
she went towards the door turning her head to say , goodbye , mrs .
she did it at a nightclub once .
i confess , my dear child , that i have in the past been disappointed by your levity .
he looked at kirsten lindstrom .
and its driving me frantic .
she doesnt really seem to have been that way .
you , too , think she is selfish ?
they dont stay the same , you know .
to put one in the picture .
and who was with him at a quarter past ten on tuesday evening ?
i dont think so , thank you , sir .
said macdonald .
we then had plum pudding , mince-pies , trifle and every kind of dessert .
a mottled red and blue substance now showed .
i assumed that by the time the war ended she had either married again or was with some man who was protecting her and the child .
is it a human being i see , or is itwhat could it be ?
some sort of way into some kind of place that no outsider would know about .
lee , but i would like your account of what happened .
papopolous , with great simplicity .
nothing in the girls lockers ?
cool , sweet , a little bewildered : i donti dont really understand what you are saying .
one of our planners , is he ?
he said : about those natives marston said : what about them ?
_num_ ' precisely , ' said the inspector dryly .
whos this ?
clearly it was a fragment of what we sought .
and then we have breakfast about half an hour afterwards , i suppose .
well , yes , the idea did come into my head just for the moment .
no , he had not brought mr .
it clearly wasnt you , the inspector pointed out , and it wouldnt have been any of the three gentlemen clarissa shook her head .
his whole life is an open book .
but there she ran headlong into the arms of a man who was emerging from a small side door .
i know im not a good player , she announced in a mournful tone which nevertheless held an undercurrent of pleasure in it .
the third day he did not turn up .
though i took the bosoms of grown-up people for granted , sybils possession of one aroused all my most envious instincts .
it seemed to him there was just the slightest pause before miss wills answered .
whats it all got to do with you , id like to know ?
if you think mothers just gone off weekending with someone youre absolutely wrong .
i judged it to be a hasty disclaimer .
you know , the kind that doesnt bother to look at the patient much , or worry whats the matter with him .
it was a sporting idea , but , on the face of it , impracticable .
shes got hold of that journalist , enderby , and shes working him for all shes worth .
the maids eyes widened in surprise .
the americans trained fingers had felt what he was looking for .
he addressed himself once more to bertrams hotel and got details as precisely as possible .
i will write to the papers .
there would be a reason , of course , said mrs .
grant asked : what makes you say that ?
couldnt get away , my dear .
husband did it , sir , he said .
the author was now in her late sixties , but still producing at least one novel a year and several short stories , as well as working on her autobiography .
it is i who have murdered sir charles .
now for breakfast at sans souci .
in this house .
now im afraid i must ask you just to look at the body once more .
you know , i think that mrs .
he went into his room and shut the door , and immediately afterwards i heard him turn the key in the lock .
walking about among people you know , looking in their facesand suddenly the faces changeand its not someone you know any longerits a strangera cruel stranger .
nothing has been touched .
i shook my head , discouraged .
when she had finished he lined up the three sketches .
it was left in trust for him to acquire at the age of twenty-five .
we were just talking of you , m .
nurse obrien shook her head .
unfortunately modern civilization rules that out , said lord caterham regretfully .
iii the social club he had been interested in in the east end of london it was there that he had first met rachel konstam .
much better than some of those people .
i am not sorry any longer .
are you sure were going to need a doctor ?
harmon spent long half hours in police constable abels off-time discussing the respective merits of manure and bone meal for rose bushes .
i thinkreallyi am rather glad .
how fair of you to mention that !
emily barton will be very annoyed with us if so .
general squalor .
but the domestic problem !
i can assure you , dr .
maude went on : helen quite appreciates what youwewill feel about it .
hes a nice kid .
' the shot told .
stockingsstockingsstockingsa vientstockingsstockingsit is the motif yesthree months agoand the other dayand now .
' you ' d better not do that .
nothing , said lynn .
i had so much to occupy my thoughts , and i still had that dull sick feeling at the pit of my stomach .
he wondered) , but she had not been able to prevent it .
arbuthnot was speaking .
i dont know whats the good of our education nowadays .
it would also knock out , i should say , the idea of someone whod obtained work as a studio helper or attendant or a servant or a gardener .
number two is seldom mentioned by name .
the same table ?
miss lemon considered .
you seem to know a lot about husbands , miss pamela , said general barnes .
do you mean again that cold hand closed round my heart .
i did my best to distract poirots mindpointing out to him that all was well , that , after all , no mischief had been done .
satterthwaite explained the theory of suicide and his own suggestion of having a cocktail glass analysed .
let me seeyes , it was a rough memorandum of some sort of our air defence positions .
hes all right very quiet and a bit on the stingy side .
how ive worshipped that woman .
she and david welwyn , who is staying here , were always such friends and so fond of each other , and we did hope , horace and i , that they would grow up and marry .
just after we were married he got into trouble at the garage where he was working over some work done on a customers car .
vincents father was the second of five sons , the eldest of whom died in infancy .
with a smile the man opposite me picked up a cable form and wrote .
he had never told his family about your marriage , i understand .
youre absolutely incapable of taking care of yourself .
i understand the death in question was an elderly clergyman .
what a blithering fool i am !
again poirot was silent ; then he said : do you know if your mistress wrote any letters yesterday evening ?
there are a lot of ramifications .
her father was half spanish , wasnt he ?
el greco eyes .
he shoots and kills .
tommy thanked him .
you enrage yourself at me , said poirot placidly .
ive worked it out beautifully , she went on .
it is all most conveniently vague .
dont have any false modesty .
the funny little man who brought you , a little man who smelt of dogs .
you were an intimate friend of her fathersyou cannot remember any business operations of his that might have resulted in ruin for some business opponent ?
her suspicion and defiance broke down .
but now approach the matter from another angle .
he went on : have you courage , madame ?
well , said nigel , were coming fairly near the bone now .
if there were anyone here who was hard up ' the other ' interrupted him with a snort .
it was locked or bolted on the inside .
mechlin lace was arranged in a cascade down the front of the bodice .
redfern , that she went to pixy cove to meet you , and that she did meet you , and that you killed her there as you had planned to do .
i asked for them !
we hurried back to the opera .
the inner office was larger .
there are two other possible suspects besides gerda christow .
the legal gentleman looked sceptical .
and tomorrow !
this isnt england .
but in england they make it not .
if you could just tell me i am telling you , arent i ?
that seems all right .
evidently she had been hurrying up the hill .
but since she is dead exactly , hastings .
what i cant quite make out is the revolver with virginia engraved upon it .
i shouldnt carry anything at all , said tommy .
but now im not sure about gwenda any more .
macmaster had said , all the same , i shouldnt be surprised , the thing is to get him to talk .
im not inhuman !
hilda lee said : it was worse than that !
elinor carlisle had reason to fear that she might be disinherited in favour of an outsider .
shall i go ahead ?
but once it had happened ?
instead , i saw , some distance away on the horizon , what looked like a row of teeth standing up , it seemed , about an inch or two from the plain below .
why shouldnt i come back ?
something , ill swear .
endicott stirred .
i worked hard .
it had been so awfulthat timeand to have it all raked up again .
perchance you are in ignorance .
it was just the trite , well-known fact that a murderer is so pleased with his cleverness that he doesnt take proper precautions .
looking like a lost hen , as usual .
you mean write to mr .
it will be , too , my most interesting caseand my most interesting criminal .
i put em in the dinin room .
she came in a red two-seater car , madam .
george , george , where is the man ?
said he was going .
i have a form .
i suppose the longer i keep it up , the safer it is for the grand duchess .
on the other hand , there are one or two gaps in the theory against m .
for some reason , you had the idea of finding a tenant for it whose name was brown .
how can i know ?
he threw open the door and dermot walked in , whilst trent switched on the light , and then came to join him .
im quite ready , superintendent .
a young french actress who specializes in playing schoolgirl parts was the agent chosen .
why , he hasnt cried , even .
shed been in some trouble , i think .
sir roland queried .
theyre amusingand very good company .
ah , youve drunk your soup , my dear .
itll be the end of it if you do .
all the household eatables lived there , and were solemnly handed out every day in anticipation of the days needs .
he followed the secretary up the broad stairs to the first landing .
the ladys discovering the robbery so soon upset her plans .
you cant possibly know what he feels like .
shell be all right this afternoon , said mrs .
renauld appeared in the doorway .
he went straight to his club , he says , and if thats confirmed all rightwhy , he couldnt have been shooting his uncle here at nine oclock in a black beard !
i knowwhat i wanted to know .
professor eckstein brightened .
what experience ?
but in my opinion she wasnt speaking the truth .
her hands were clenched on the rail .
no , its a sort of beetle and its made out of some stone .
butwhat did you mean ?
surprised what one can check up through an odd word or two here and there .
she was turning the hand a little from left to right , so that the stone caught the light .
carpenter .
theyre handling hundreds of plates and dishes , and theyll be all lumped together .
norma sounded indignant .
i cant see why everything on earth doesnt drop out of it the whole time , said jimmy .
you understand that , no doubt .
we investigated as delicately as possible the rumour of his attachment to the doctors daughter ; but while it seemed clear that there had been a strong friendship between them at one time , there had been a most abrupt break two months previously , and they did not appear to have seen each other since .
no wars , no poverty , no ill health , no ugliness .
it had been judged necessary for tuppence to walk to leatherbarrow exactly as instructed , since if she had been driven there in a car the fact might have been noted .
but wed have seen them , objected the admiral .
the boy nodded .
since that drew no attention he raised his voice .
the girl cant know what she wants to do all by herself .
i inclined to the latter view .
inspector hardcastle took a last deliberate look at the letters on the hall table .
was she capable of murder ?
its colour was greyish green .
oh , said philip , and paused a minute .
not when you are out riding ?
you didnt see him later that day ?
everything before that is a blank .
it startled me , you see .
young fellow came and knocked him up in the middle of the night .
but you cannot get away from the fact , mon cher jessop , that there were people in the plane .
miss marple was missing .
sir henry was sitting in his usual place on the low wall , but midge turned away and walked up towards the flower walk .
miss patterson drew us out into the corridor .
shes such a handsome girl , isnt she ?
mary politely retrieved various odds and endsa handkerchief , an engagement book , an old-fashioned leather purse , two shillings , three pennies , and a striped piece of peppermint rock .
i havent been to london , said bundle .
at least we only want to do what we want ourselves , we dont want everybody else to do what we want , we dont want to make slaves of other people .
then he went on to another compartment and came back and got a bottle of mineral water for someone .
there is really absurdly little evidence against him .
it needs a bit of tact and experience .
then that lets the celebrated dr .
you know , where you ran down that german chap .
there lewis and carrie louise are , living there , surrounded by these boyswho arent perhaps quite normal .
i made no reply .
and if i had seen anything , i should have said so at the inquest .
i began to have a shadowy picture both of the victim and of the murderer .
a mistake , or a deliberate lie ?
but im more interested in the various superstitions pertaining to violent deathsthat a murdered man , for instance , cant rest in his grave .
although already engaged for the dance that was just beginning , she had floated on to the floor in his arms .
i started my quest in portlebury itself .
the man was dangerous .
probably a conscientious objector .
henetyes .
most reasonable , said mr .
no man in his senses would break into a house with a light in it .
she remembered how one day mrs .
all that nofrets coming did was to bring it from its hidden place into the light .
i wish to satisfy myself as to whether voices in the little lobby could have been heard outside on the terrace .
yes , id like to have it .
he does conscientious , mediocre work .
thats just a way of describing it , of course .
i fell in with her views .
he leaned forward and tapped her on the shoulder in a minatory kind of way .
there is nothing of the socialist about poirot .
you told me to entrust sobek with the sale of the timber .
it doesnt matter how quiet you go .
unless some sadistic element enters in .
bollard and the bracelet .
so you can stir your stumps , my lad , and get going .
you thought what ?
sorry , sorry .
his glance shifted .
you see tuppence treated him to a cold stare .
i dont think she noticed .
it made me feel quite important .
justice wargrave removed his garments and prepared himself for bed .
sarah said in a harsh voice : but whats the point of it all , m .
a good deal of makeup , i think , said jennifer vaguely .
she was boy mad , she was .
last tuesday , think it was .
greta pulled me through things .
and you have intrigued meyes , you have intrigued me very much .
thats it , said jimmy .
cest trs bien a !
we know nowthat we are on the right track .
it was madame giselles special kind of miracle , said poirot drily .
im off tonight to durban .
times very short you know .
i must explain the purpose of my visit , went on poirot .
im sorryi was stupid .
i think that the french girls one saw bathing in fashion-plates owed their smartness to the fact that they never actually swam , only walked gently into the sea and out again to parade the beach .
shes out hunting .
without wishing to disagree with you , m .
but i still do not knowher address .
and miss restarick hates her stepmother .
he grinned at her engagingly .
she gave a slight questioning glance at poirot .
i have just discovered a dead body in a sarcophagus in the long barn at rutherford hall .
what with being excited , and christmas eve , and one thing and another if you really love me , said tommy , will you answer me one question ?
phillipa looked up .
let us assume that miss king was not mistaken and not deliberately lying .
it was just two-thirty , and , a minute late , the much benham bus drew up outside the post office door .
if george does find him out , he wont blame you .
howard raikes said grimly : the gun was in your hand and it had just been fired !
his hair was cut en brosse , and he had a moustache of the hohenzollern persuasion .
incident in anatolia _num_ .
thats as may bebut theres still a folliat here .
and you dont feel like one .
oh yes , she used to take you down to the beach and play with you in the garden .
but its extraordinary , quite extraordinary .
one has to go through all the machinery of making them wards of court , and all the rest of it .
now i realized as soon as i saw her that she was the same type as annie webb and poor mrs .
and no one hearing a sound on account of the tap-tapping of mr .
he remained blandly impervious , and blocked her bowling so successfully that she herself was at a loss how to proceed .
horrible !
no , laura explained .
it is some time since i was in baghdad , actually i have not been here since the war .
at the sound of approaching steps , mrs .
and then she told me to go away .
poirot murmured cautiously : you did noterconsult him before dispatching the money ?
of course i may be simply making an awful ass of myself , but i dont think so .
there was a case in colorado the little mans voice trailed on , voluble , mildly enthusiastic .
with his fingernail , he pressed hard into the open jaws of the snake that was coiled round the tree .
do you know where miss bulstrode is ?
to nicholas and desmond .
someone who was definitely mentally deranged , though no one had any idea of it .
a serious mana criminalwould know my name .
cyrus bradburn of having engineered the disappearance of captain harwell .
) carol boynton returns to camp _num_ .
a number of girls , dressed in pale green sheaths and all looking exactly like poppy , confused me .
i shouldnt like to think it of her , i shouldnt indeed .
she might have been , yesbut i dont think she was .
i know what youve always thought , bland .
she doesnt keep abreast of current thought .
she been down to pillar-box with letter and come back in do you know what time she came in ?
inspector neele was almost sure that a wary expression had come into her blue eyes .
she sounded ingenuously surprised , as though money was the last thing she expected to be mentioned .
i thought about it .
if only hed given us one clueas to whom that letter was addressed .
i remonstrated with her on her imprudence , for i may tell you gentlemen that , on my insistence , she was preparing to bring a suit for divorce against her husband .
houses were difficult on the thames , because they were either hideous late victorian or else the kind of cottage that was completely submerged during the winter .
we will investigate this affair together .
i can try , i suppose .
absolute nonsense .
first it was only wallpapersbut now its dead bodies .
you did well , my boy , said melchett .
gerald wade had mentioned seven dials in that last letter of his written to his sister on the night before his death .
that it was a man killed sessle .
it doesnt much matter , does it ?
now dont frighten nurse , said mrs .
voil !
he thought a slight reserve came into her manner .
it was about a month ago now , wasnt it ?
to be quite frank , which is better i think , since you are not a near relative and are unlikely to be disturbed by this information , doctor thinks that she is sinking fast , that she may die without recovering consciousness .
the girl began trembling violently .
around them a well-dressed languid london crowd eddied mildly .
she rose from the bed .
i wish the earlier killings were a little more plausible .
she looks very sadand terribly delicate .
thered be no more people with mental troubles .
dont pass it on to any one of those idiots in the government , or connected with government or hoping to be participating in government after this lot runs out .
nobody , so far as we knew , received anymore letters .
she was fairly sure she would not be missed for some time .
i have not asked anyone else .
nine fourth month of winter _num_ th day imhotep sat facing esa .
must we talk about ainswick ?
the eyes rested with recognition on the doctors face .
shot with a pistol , the lady was , continued the boy .
ruth van rydock looked humorously at her friend .
and a good many other things as well .
full of cheerfulness over other peoples troubles .
what is it you know about norma ?
no , no , i suppose they wouldnt .
in most ways , thought mr .
her voice was perfectly calm and composed .
its no good , lance .
no , come on out of it .
i meant to walk .
a dreadful business , m .
ah , i will explain .
ask him why hes making all these inquiries into blackbirds and rye in fathers pocket .
judith got them for her from the bathroom as nurse craven had just gone out .
you se , the key missing .
it was not often that his intuitions led him astray .
he added , it has served its purpose .
on the wall there hung a coloured map of new york city , also an object of interest to me .
his arm drew her closer .
youve been nearly drownedthats whats the matter , returned settle grimly .
and he went out of the room , leaving me to my meditations .
finally i put the paper down and looked enquiringly at poirot .
inspector neele glanced at the telephone .
there , it is a very good hint i have given you there and , leaning back , poirot closed his eyes , it may have been to think , but it is quite certain that five minutes later he was fast asleep .
i hope youll forgive me , nurse cowleymrs .
but you cant , of course , confide in a stranger .
years ago , she said .
its in my address book somewhere .
she said in a low , shaky voice : have you found out any more about who killed john ?
yes , miss lessing .
but one thing is quite certain .
and it waswhathat paint ?
but surely , if i did that , you will give me credit for enough intelligence to have wiped off my own fingerprints first !
and anyway , im a socialist i know , my dear , i know , said lord caterham hastily .
what swine men are , arent they ?
shes a lovely baby .
i was conscious of an aching head and a shooting pain down my left arm when i tried to move , and everything seemed dreamlike and unreal .
i brought a hand-glass and she examined her face .
you could guess , said poirot .
finally anthony dismissed him with a nod , but all the while he was eating the excellent meal which giuseppe served to him , he was thinking rapidly .
inspector bland poked at it with a cautious forefinger .
im afraid , you know , that she was always rather a wicked woman .
my life is my own .
he had a big chain on and a wife with yellow hair , wearing royal blue with frills .
and then you offer him money to give you an alibi ?
there would have to be servants in a house like that .
your knife , hastings !
she went on in an agitated manner : nothing of this kind has ever happened beforenever in my memory .
he moved away .
but it was explained nowbob , when he had been let out last night , had shamelessly and deliberately gone off on pleasure bent .
there was a pattern hereperhaps several patterns , and yet she herself could obtain no clear glimpse of it or them .
she was a woman of about thirty-five , anaemic looking , but with a strong frame .
she directed mason to get out the luggage and put it in the cloakroom .
the special branch and all the rest of it .
oh , it wasnt very long ago .
youve got hold of a mares nest .
he followed her , closing the door behind him and locking it .
its a wild story with no proofs .
one of those handsome , long-haired chaps , but he had ability all right .
she looked across at maisie and laughed mockingly .
iv emily barton came just after tea had been cleared away .
the upshot of it all was that he had seen rayburn .
nadine isfunny .
through the gate the girl came and collided with me with a force that nearly knocked me off the pavement .
having scoffed at ( _num_ ) , expressed incredulity at ( _num_ ) , offered to find a car himself to ( _num_ ) , and bargained fluently in arabic for ( _num_ ) , signor richetti had at last departedhis departure being arranged in a secret and furtive manner , in case some of the other tourists should take it into their heads to stray from the appointed paths of sightseeing .
he remained quietly devoted to his wife .
watch her eyes .
doesnt matter whether he does or doesnt in the position hes in .
storks are highly thought of in most of the middle east , and everyone treats them with great respect .
on friday evenings mrs .
she had been there two summers running .
every now and then i looked over towards the house to see if she was coming .
ii and does it not intrigue you , my friend , to see the address from which i write ?
being near a railway station or town was of no consequence .
but what a woman she is , eh derek ?
her tone sounded wistful .
protheroe had left the studio or before .
you will not let me die .
you enjoyed that experience , yes ?
i wouldnt say he was perfectly normal , but you might say , who is ?
my methods , mr .
then i walked forward , my hands outstretched .
oh , youve comeyouve come !
look here , he said , ive still got the letter .
what did you want to go to the cemetery for ?
its outrageous that we should be shut up here with a dead body .
well , i think these newfangled ways of giving invitations are very tiresome , said mrs .
you dont think him guilty , mr .
tommy displayed dismay .
) i cant ask you to marry me .
so i went along .
vous voil , hastings !
lady chevenix-gore seized on the suggestion with manifest relief .
blore said : no , he isnt !
get em on the run , inspector taverner had said .
lydia said in her quiet voice : it has been a frightful shock to my husbandto all of usbut particularly to him .
the man returned shortly ; with him came the manager .
i take the holiday .
you ought to have known , amanda , you were keeping an eye on things .
im going indoors .
yes , i will give you explanations .
lucy eyelesbarrow read and reread the letter from miss marple .
and lucia is so sweet , and so absolutely right for richard .
he sent in his card and was told that sir joseph was engaged at the moment but would see him presently .
i should have thought the wish of the master of the house was enough , said nofret softly .
and , as the old gentleman himself said , the thief is caught like a rat in a trap .
lord , im frozen .
you dont think he made a mistake in the injection ?
tea , she squeaked , thats what he said , tea , not lemonade .
one was to miss howard , and one was to mr .
poirot eyed her consideringly , and said : you seem a very clever girl , marilyn .
you could resume acquaintance with her ?
but he found no inspiration there , and turning slowly he walked back along the path between the cypresses and into the quiet garden .
marie and i used to go out and pick baskets of them , and eat masses of them at the same time .
they are very clever electrotypes .
yes , said sir charles .
any one could see with half an eye that the woman was as pious as could bethe kind that was hand and glove with parsons .
ive landed my bird , dora , she boomed triumphantly .
the proprietor behind the bar , a slim italian-looking fellow with sideburns , whom i had taken to be luigi , came to intervene in a voice that was pure cockney london .
it would have to be saturday or sunday .
she went to the door and miss greer called after her : what do you mean ?
hearing footsteps behind him , he turned his head , and grinned at chief inspector kemp .
all the same , you know , went on mr .
but she talks .
red roses .
stephen caught up with her and stopped also .
he wasnt an ordinary crook .
he was thirty-three , had magnificent health , good looks , plenty of money , an extremely beautiful wife whom he had recently married and , to all appearances , no cares or worries .
all they want at present is to keep out of all this mess .
sit down here on the grass , do .
it is for you to make her forget to stand by her in her trouble .
one doesnt like spitting a thing out .
i had liked mosul ; i had become deeply attached to both c .
youre a thief , remember , a thief .
a buxom young woman with dark hair and red cheeks hovered in the background .
no , he said slowly .
he said hed forgotten mrs spences turkish cigarettes .
i stretched out my hand .
to his intense annoyance he could distinguish little more ; just a chance word here and there if a voice was raised , which merely served to whet his curiosity still further .
lucy and mrs .
its true that hed leave no footprints on the path , said battle , but from the shape of the dent and the way the turf was cut , i dont think the pistol was thrown from that direction .
po[rot , are only slightly less than the evils caused by drink .
ive had detectives guarding me and young men being vetted before theyre allowed even to speak to me .
she did not notice it .
oh , anne !
i believe , said tommy thoughtfully , she used to get rather a lot of fun out of saying to old friends of hers when they came to see her ive left you a little something in my will , dear or this brooch that youre so fond of ive left you in my will .
but i dont want to leave it on my plate .
replied poirot .
some i think were from the studiosthe ones i didnt know .
" i had no idea of such a thing .
but even as she formulated the idea , she was horrified at herself .
it was that which has led us astray .
i dont think it will have been exactly your fault .
absurd that a manan ordinary , yes , a perfectly ordinary young manshould be able to do that to one !
emily brent came out of the drawing room window to meet them .
roger lemesurier looked at his watch .
i say , oughtnt we to have some lethal weapons ?
poirot gave a deep sigh .
things go by contraries in this world and beautiful mothers have hideous children .
i know then who the real thief is .
you will never prove it .
finally , however , a good man had appeared on the scene .
i want to use my hands .
if theyre very good gardeners they seem to come to their prime when theyre over eighty , but if you get a strong , hefty-looking young man about thirty-five who says , ive always wanted to work in a garden , you may be quite sure that hes probably no good at all .
in my room .
what about the blood on his coat ?
i dont like admitting , george , that a womans been too clever for us .
as i have just said , in the course of conversation a man gives himself awayyou were imprudent enough to mention that for a while you were on a farm in south africa .
it is useful for travelling .
i want to get on with that picture .
she seems veryattached to mr .
when did you last see mary draperuntil today ?
it crashedlanding .
an establishment like the royal clarence would keep its registers .
im sorry to have to dispute the matter , said chichester with a meek smile which failed to mask his determination to get his own way .
on his return he found that a totally unexpected development had arisen .
i ought to have noticed that the lady was dead sooner .
she turned into the drawing room and charles followed her .
we found him reclining on some cushions , clad in an amazing dressing gown of purple and orange .
his dark melancholy eyes searched for those of mr .
you do not like her , madame ?
i thought the next thing to fill the bill would be the weary man of the world at monte carlo , or possibly a laird in the highlandshes versatile , charles is .
robberies and murders did not lurk obscurely in its back pages .

after all , youre born what you are .
he went down to chipping somerton and started to poke about there .
every bit of information youve got or ferret out has got to be given to the police .
youre probably right there , said lance .
her voice had gone flat again .
our son was killed in the war , said mrs lacey .
anyway , she added , throwing the core of the apple into the goldfish pool , i wouldnt tell you .
but if , in a fit of despair , she went out and drowned herself whilst her innocent husband slept , the whole thing would be a romantic tragedy , and no one would be likely to suggest that she had been drowned deliberately .
because its what you are !
i shut my eyesand think .
he had never heard of it .
jolting !
tommy observed that albert had hung the picture of the house by the canal up on the wall .
these feelings of mine may be only sick fancies .
she said in a stifled voice : its all right .
struck by the silence in the room i looked up sharplyboth my father and taverner were watching me .
templeton only who is so much on your mind ?
the priests hole is the show exhibit for americans and tourists generally .
such a beautiful house .
one cannot always be pettifogging and cautious !
both the hamilton clipps were , victoria thought , decidedly impressed .
he came racing up the hill very out of breath .
well go to the library , she said .
i asked him what exactly he did mean , and of course , as i suspected , the boy didnt really know .
and mind you , shes the goods all right .
yes , yes , very foolish of him .
you never even looked at that remarkably pretty nurse you had .
somebody must have done so .
we were discussing a recent purchase of hisan old walnut bureau .
you are warning me against claude langton .
they started running .
theres not much to see or do in that part of the world .
you comprehend , it has been a severe blow to me to find that miss arundell has recently died .
i examined the body this morning at ten oclock .
well , where is this secret ?
although , of course , the dear italian lakes are quite delightful in the spring , i always think .
sir claud amory , he thought to himself .
hell spring out on me !
he dropped into a chair , stared hard at poirot , and said : well ?
the thief knows that in a very few minutes sir claud will be silenced for ever .
shadowing someone , i suppose .
the old lady by her side nodded her head .
thought lady coote to herself .
fancy what a feeling of security it will give you to go through life with a man who can extricate you from any dangerous situation .
tell me that !
i knew i could beat the train easily .
both women sighed .
ill have tea now .
miss marple inquired with a kind of dewy innocence .
hes got a little trouble of his own to attend to which is keeping him busy .
mr jesmond looked at him doubtfully .
i rushed over .
rowland followed the trail .
well , now we know where we are .
i suppose she could go queer suddenly .
it was certainly martin b .
i consider theyve treated us in a most cavalier fashion here .
on the second day after this , count streptitch called upon her there .
his head turned very slightly towards the old man in the chair , but he caught himself back in time .
poirot gave a sudden laugh .
father will have to come and bail me out , thats all .
he himself walked part way to meet his brother and they had come up to the house together .
do not raise your voice too much .
it was sister andersons habit to size up her nurses after a day or two , and to divide those whom she would take trouble to train and those who were , as she put , only fit to go and see if the crock is boiling .
however heartless you think me , id rather tell you .
i understand that mrs .
just a list of names , he said .
lydia said sharply : if you like to stand out , that is your business .
madame , we do not say that for a moment .
my shroud of white , stuck all with yew o prepare it ; my part of death no one so true ; did share it .
ive got a frienda real friend .
the blue hollyhockdanger .
and he said again : sure , honey , sure .
this house belonged then to a man called capel .
race said , pointing to the revolver : rather fancy weve seen this not so very long ago .
my word , they looked a plain lot .
' ' i don ' t know at all .
one of the servants was implicated of that i was sure .
it upset me terribly seeing her like that .
asked david sharply .
place is in a mess .
you mean that both my watch and the clock were wrong ?
genteel poverty !
but i thought charles broke in .
i asked doubtfully .
alfred cried out : good heavens , father , you never told me .
you want me to do something to find out something , to cover a certain line of interrogation ?
have there been accidents here ?
epub edition january _num_ isbn _num_ this e-book was set from the agatha christie signature edition published by harpercollins publishers , london .
you understand well enough , i daresay , said anthony , breaking the silence .
why dont you like it , grandma ?
those faint scratches on the end of the barrel .
and yet what you really want , both of you , is to be in each others arms , is it not ?
the child who is born next after twins has special powers , so they told me .
poirot did not allow himself to be angered .
i must confess that that particular ethical significance of the mystery has escaped me , said sir henry gravely .
he was gruntinglistening .
you dont know what it was that upset him ?
the millionaire listened attentively , with an increasing satisfaction .
this statement was at complete variance with what he had been told about the arrival of etienne de sousas letter at the breakfast table .
he knew very accurately the domestic arrangements of _num_ , queen charlotte street .
allaby is here now , as it happens , interviewing candidates .
you mean to say he was not the pukka sahib ?
it wasnt till i was getting into bed that i realized why theyd looked sort of familiar to me .
he stretched his arms above his head as though seeking inspiration from on high , and then addressed the constable again .
he twirled his moustache .
if anything crops up to connect you with her we should be prepared beforehand .
but a needles a painful weapon .
the passports and tickets were in a pile at one side .
yes , jeremy agreed .
it makes , of course , a lot of workbut fortunately mary does not seem to mind at all .
theres a girl who is new this term too called jennifer and she and i rather do things together .
no , i havent heard anything particular .
poirot replied in the affirmative and sergeant oconnor rang off .
the spanish servants thought i was praying for his life to be saved .
she added : a kind friend gave me this trip as a gift .
and i guess i appreciate your telling me so .
so i gather from detective stories .
they always are , she added .
no , captain marshall is an old friend of yours , mademoiselle ?
when was this ?
you couldnt be happy when there was a person there youhated .
his story was substantially the same as he had told at the inquest , and he had little to add to it .
poirot murmured : and presumably it was verified .
i do so agree with you , inspector .
so she just went off to the cottage .
it ended in my being sent to a sanatorium at bournemouth .
lucy examined the tree itself .
that is not surprising .
we knew that he also travelled north with vincent that night .
clement , has been given up to this work .
it was full of closely folded banknotes .
there are two doors into the oak parlour , one into the hall and one into the terrace room .
but if i did not go at all , she might quite possibly come and look me up at the villa .
harry said at last : well , well .
there was an accident to the plane .
some old pussy up at wilbraham crescent .
its like some horrible child playing a game .
she half opened her lips to speak but refrained from putting a question .
they hoped that i might have some clue as to where they were hidden .
let me get this clear , he said rather snappily .
i meantoh !
the stairs , sir .
a few minutes elapsed , and then we heard a footfall within , and the door was opened .
but poirot paid no attention .
what are they doing there ?
starting with the sadness of the accident which had just taken place .
why , all the money in the world would not buy me !
this is a surprise .
easier to enter the house , help himself , and disappear quietlyunless just possibly he was observed by someone in the neighbourhood and knew himself to have been observed .
yet people say that actually you were terribly upset .
thousands of women arent even that .
it was only a journey-out job .
it runs in our family .
he produced a fellow who was underhays best friend in a few hours .
again no , for there had been two witnesses of that shooting , and we knew all about it .
first the mother , now the daughter .
and if it turns out that sir claud was indeed poisoned hastings was now well into his stride it makes dr carelli more than ever the prime suspect .
she thanked him with a glance , and a minute later stood safely on a broad path of rock .
it will be no trouble to me , i assure you , said the countess zerkowski .
do you realize that ive had grave suspicions that youd planted yourself here under a false name in order to get information out of me ?
rather inconvenient in some ways and very nice and cosy in other ways .
a curious person .
poor walter , his mothers darling little walter fane who had attacked his older brother with a poker and had tried to kill him .
and you never thought of telling me .
thesiger , i was interested to get mr .
the murderers only got time to nip out of the room and turn the key from the outside .
however i didnt see them often .
you dare to say that to me ?
you are no son of mine !
it is a convenience .
about two years .
pretty girl .
well , i saw the honourable geraldine , and her story tallied exactly with his lordships .
look here , if you want to readdont she interrupted him .
i see , said craddock thoughtfully .
she had no idea what he was talking about .
we settled ourselves there .
he went to the war and acquitted himself bravely .
i think its lovely to be back , said jennifer .
her effects there had been wistful and suggestive rather than commanding .
i passed , didnt i ?
dont think of whats going to happen next .
it was a plain refusal , with no frills on it .
sobek said angrily : the trouble is that i am not trusted .
he didnt see what evidence there could be against her .
revel if she will be at home this afternoon at four oclock as i am very anxious to see her about an important matter .
' i was sorry not to have seen you at dinner last night , ' she said .
we neednt beat about the bush really , need we , my dear fellow ?
revel , into your confidence also ?
ross-perkins .
nothing fits in anywhere , said anthony discontentedly .
the commissary rubbed his chin thoughtfully for a minute or two without speaking .
its the police at norwich , sir .
she said : its such a glorious sunny day !
a lovely room , isnt it ?
his face , which had brightened , fell again .
and the pupils , of course .
virginia had an excellent memory for faces , and she was at once quite sure that she had never seen the man before .
the thing seemed incredible , because mr .
you too , dad .
if a girl is frightened she clasps her heart , or she raises her hands to her mouth to stifle a cry , but if her hands are on her hair it means something very different .
they were the newcomers of the night before .
it is in the spare room bed .
there they took me into a ground-floor room .
lots of parties ?
miss marple inquired .
they see , of course , that i had a motive .
doctor , for gods sake come .
your health is good , i am glad to see , he said .
yes , huish ?
i think isaac must have known quite a lot of things which he could have told us .
they are sceptical , all of them .
' white slavers , sir , i ' ve said so all alongt cook was always warning me against them .
in which case , macqueen knew of the note and of its destructionin other words , he was either the murderer or an accomplice of the murderer .
she had the sandbag ready in her hand to defend herself if attacked .
their scrutiny seemed to make patrick redfern uncomfortable .
he said nothing whatever , monsieur .
i turned to see mrs .
osborne was silent for about a minute , then he made up his mind .
but surely , dear m .
it would be a bit of a fluke , though .
his green eyes and his finicking habits .
besides , i liked your christian name , she added .
we know all about you , he said .
he can act quickly , remember .
that would be very kind of you , said tuppence .
the only thing she was worrying about was whether john wasnt getting too much wrapped up in his experiments and might overdo things , or try some of his messes upon himself .
he brought his mind back to the job in hand .
such a lot of things are real though you cant really bring yourself to believe it .
she ran into dora bunner outside .
it was a sadly chastened george who sat consuming eggs and bacon the following morning .
these people ; decayed aristocrats , impoverished members of the old county families , they are all so much mise en scne ?
for i saw her walking round her garden at three oclock this afternoon , and she seemed in perfect health .
suddenly he stiffened .
i have a very long experience of the methods he employs .
we thought at first tommys spine was hurt , but it turned out to be a very slight injury and hes quite all right now .
he heard a lot here and there .
i should be obliged if you would make a point of it .
very attractive landscapes , some of them .
it was indifferently cooked and indifferently served .
he supposed he was imagining things .
no question any more of letting richard abernethie lie quiet in his grave .
there was no train , anyway .
a likely story .
shall we get back to our original subject of discussionyour reason for coming here ?
hed never been over to this country before , i believe .
not explicitly .
both detectives stared at him as though unable to believe their ears .
he took his departure , shaking his head sadly .
but knowledge is one thing , suspicion is another .
dash it all , she isnt aiming to play at wimbledon .
oliver , this really makes my head ache .
that someone has murder in their heart ?
so far , he has been hopefulvery hopeful .
youre laughing , my dear , said miss marple , but after all , that is a very sound way of arriving at the truth .
his voice trailed off .
thats all there is to it at the moment .
well , she said at last , i do and i dont .
she went back to the cards , knelt , and slowly began to shovel them into a heap against one end of the sofa .
did you notice the postmark ?
i mustnt tell tales out of school .
bryan eastley ?
before it had been a matter of a slim woman in a disguising headscarf and a mackintosh .
now my car my car , i think , john .
hence kings messengers and all that .
frankie recounted her adventures , beginning with the story she had heard from mr .
he looked vaguely worried and turned to judith enquiringly .
but what can you possibly gain by reflection ?
very well , the lytton gores are out of it , you and i and mrs .
why indeed ?
a son with a criminal record .
now , it seems , he had as yet had no luck .
tout de mme , she is dead .
then theres a man called ardwyck fenn .
no , said poirot thoughtfully , it is not near enough .
but its no good minding about it .
well , thats rather what we expected .
asked melchett as we went upstairs again .
you cant really spare anyone anything , she said .
wont you be friends ?
au revoir , inspector , said emily sweetly .
toby would skin her grandmother !
has no one else anything to add ?
' ' thank you - thank you , ' the .
thats her school training .
some day i will pay it .
uncle , said dermot .
the compartment was as he had left it , with the tiny blue light in the ceiling .
theres none thatll get any good out of gipsys acre .
nevile turned a harassed face towards him .
were too old .
shant go in just yet .
for a moment the inspector was on the point of starting forward under the impression that the young lady had captured the murderer red-handed , but almost immediately he realized that her meaning was quite different .
and there are other possibilities .
the children rushed across the hall back to the dining room .
he was thinking desperately .
you mean it doesnt go together ?
regular turn up , they ad .
aunt emily was prejudiced against my husband because he was not an englishman , and she may therefore have believed things that theresa said about him .
yes , i really think it must be .
but i wander from the point .
no less a personage than the italian ambassador himself came forward and testified at the police court proceedings that ascanio had been with him at the embassy from eight till nine that evening .
i receive a letter _num_ .
yes , and the girl amy was there at the time .
at six oclock in the morning , roberts opened the door carefully and looked out .
i congratulate you on taking the risk .
a dictator !
nurse hopkins went on : hes got it badly , in my opinion .
he bent over the tray before them .
which cant be very near because the body wasnt examined until the following morning .
i took my driving test last summer .
he was coming up to her rapidly .
nothing could have been more select .
he added dreamily after a moment or two : rather an interesting shaped heada curious angle from the crown to the neckrendered less noticeable by the way he has his hair cut , but distinctly unusual .
a flat on the fourth floor is a bit of an undertaking , said jimmy .
something in the complete immobility of her attitude struck mr .
that gives one to think furiously , does it not ?
beatrice church , the upper-housemaid , was the first to appear .
tell him not to underestimate percival , my dear .
but rosemary had a reason .
its tricky .
i thought perhaps one could get through the woods this way and so to the quay .
death was due to eserine poisoning .
i dont think , my dear , she said , that mr .
in the drawing room george was standing with a puckered brow and an orange envelope in his hand .
if the woman in the sarcophagus was not anna stravinska , where was anna now ?
poirot looked at her quickly .
its a great relief to people to be able to tell all their troubles to someone .
the woman i saw thereannano _num_ .
jealousy , you know , is usually not an affair of causes .
you dont look to me as though youd ever been on a horse in your life !
at any rate , you will have to take my word for it , inspector .
one key was the final clue in this murder hunt .
there are only two things ive never done , an honest days work , or paid my own way .
the man was very abusive about it and made a lot of threats .
as far as he knows , theres no reason why that person shouldnt be there .
how funny boys are !
ill make a note of that .
im beginning to think were wrong about the whole thingthere never has been any dope in that club .
but they were not satisfied .
the big young woman with the plain face looked gratified .
except freedom .
in rubies .
he was too trusting .
i thought you could never wash out blood stains .
it was ascot cup day , and the policeman on duty in a certain section of the british museum rubbed his eyes and wondered if he were dreaming , for one does not expect to see there an ascot vision , in a lace frock and a marvelous hat , a veritable nymph as imagined by a parisian genius .
and may i offer you , mademoiselle , my very deepest sympathy .
he paused to close the door and then advanced upon us in no uncertain fashion .
to be a good german i must be on time at my work .
gaskell , you mean ?
it had mud applied to it .
rivington was unable to tell him .
thats what it looked like anyway .
questions asked in the house .
another knock .
her eyes opened wide .
leidner was highly attractive to the male sex .
i thought you said it was hannibal ?
shes going to pump him , madre does like having her little secrets , doesnt she ?
you filthy bitch !
yes , sir , thats what im saying .
ive never cared for washing up but of course its got to be doneyou cant get away from that .
weve turned up here according to plan , guvnor , said the little man in a husky voice .
i dont see what my political views have to do with mrs .
you did a minute ago .
she seems just silly .
one of those sort of names , if you know what i mean .
pilar sat there smiling .
it was at that moment tredwell came into the room and looked around him hesitatingly .
we entered the dining room rather late , and were shown to a table by the window .
a really stupid letter .
and for gods sake dont look at me !
over his shoulder , sharpe saw also what there was to see .
the ticket collector sighed reluctantly and glanced at his watch .
answered .
the operation only occupied about three minutes .
he had schooled himself to accept those .
colgate nodded gloomily .
perhaps youre right there .
hes pretty well-known as a big-game hunter , and , as you heard him say tonight , he was a distant cousin of sir laurence eardsley .
vittoria muzio , her name is .
you see , shes lost her place .
but this is splendid , anna , she said .
i was afraid it might have been a terrible grief to you .
it seems he has been disentangling some military scandal in syria .
he grasped the heavy virginia creeper and climbed nimbly till he reached the sill of a window .
egypt , breathed m .
another minute or two the door opened and joanna farley care m .
shes in the parlour .
oliver to visit him , and why she was so doubtful about what she was doing .
therefore he couldnt have done it .
it fell into disrepair and burned down in about _num_ .
very often another , working towards the same goal , has arrived there first .
to begin with i will tell you that i have put the order in your affairs .
leidner said quietly : tell him what louise was like , nurse .
sharply the telephone rang .
she said sharply : i cant understand it .
the man stared at poirot with a dropped jaw .
im sorry if i have kept you waiting , mr .
she went right down in front of it .
darling mrs .
kemp shook his head and took an approving sip of his tea .
although she had no doubts of her own powers to sustain a rle indefinitely , she had too much common sense not to recognize the force of mr .
ratchett passed that wayand dropped that button .
edward , unfortunately , was the faithful kind .
colonel bury snorted .
finally she went into the grocers .
to begin with , we know all about miss kingston bruces visit to you this morning .
no , theres nothing in the second half of the sale that i want .
young girls and men are always doing such extraordinary thingsscreaming , pushing each other , giggling or making some kind of noisethat i had no idea it was anything serious .
cest impossible !
as things now stand , the crash is bound to come .
shed always seemed such a happy woman before , said mrs .
she wavered .
six of them stood to benefit in a greater or lesser degree by miss arundells death .
lord cornelly took no notice .
and turning away she flounced upstairs .
she could have put anything in that beer glass of his .
lancaster in person .
well , what would you put in an english garden , pat , if you had one ?
blenkensop was conducted by miss minton to a depot to pack and address parcels for the front .
following up his trial , it seems that he went first to london .
we might have sent out a search party or done something silly .
why wouldnt they let me go with her ?
then your instructions would be that we pay this sum of money into your bank ?
certain types of leprosy are curable .
' good evening , sir , ' she said , as the two men took their seats at a corner table .
nobody can push me around any longer .
somebody meant it to look as though i had killed george , and i didnt .
i mean , she was perfectly all right when i saw herabsolutely .
mais oui , that is what the murderer did not expect .
a most accomplished little actress .
they were waitingthat was all .
i am quite sure .
and you do ?
hardsomething .
you think that because i was ready to blackmail , that i would stoop just as easily to fraud .
stillingfleet , listen to me .
she had the calm serene features of a madonna with big sympathetic dark eyes .
youre rather hot on that .
i took a quick impulsive step off the path .
theres a little doubt over that .
as lady macbeth , as magda , there was no one to touch her .
this is a rather urgent matter on which we have come , so if you will take us to him nowhe expects us , i understand ?
so you think it was deliberate ?
well , good day for now .
well , as a matter of fact , ierwell , egg and i im delighted to hear it , said mr .
he had been told that he had only a year to live , but may , who had always been one of his most zealous parishioners , had insisted on getting together a subscription from the congregation and bringing him to london to consult doctors there .
but youd never lie down to be blackmailed .
gaitskill , grandfathers lawyer .
fate seems to have chosen you out to be mixed up in this .
she displayed neither heat nor passion , and never considered for a moment any side of a question but her own .
lives on women and has strange depraved cravings !
soldiers !
the girl frances was leaning against the window .
then he collected the coffee cups and withdrew .
i quite understand that mrs .
lets walk to the serpentine .
that people wont die ?
she had a most sympathetic personalitydevoted to childrenand apparently quite genuinely heartbroken at each death .
it is laughable !
ruth , though , was terribly upset .
my colleague tells me that hes seen you beforelast winter ?
on the palm of his hand he held out a small oval of dark blue enamel .
only a trace of it lingered , but it was there , and again the scent was not the scent that associated itself in his mind with any of the occupants of the hollow .
because im not a fool .
im afraid i cant lay claim to be a practical gardener , said hardcastle .
his stuffs gone up enormously in priceenormously .
they embark on a daring business schemeyoung adventurers ltdwilling to do anything , go anywhere .
he knew quite well he wasnt a mental case , whatever dr .
let me congratulate you on your escape , madame .
made of valenciennes lace , i believe .
i saw him yesterdayat market basing .
dinsmead hesitatingly .
it was not chance that jacqueline de belleforts foot kicked the pistol under the settee , where it would be out of sight and unremembered until later .
one glass eye dropped out .
the gentlemans not making the return trip .
ferguson merely snorted .
in the absence of further evidence incriminating some particular person , he could only direct the jury to return a verdict of murder against a person or persons unknown .
because i did not rememberi did not think only afterwards do i say to myself , it was planned thenplanned with her .
cheshire catthats a grinhenny-penny , thats another fairy story , isnt it , for the hen , and lo ah , said tuppence , lo does you in , does it ?
after waiting a moment for him to speak , mrs warwick asked coldly , do i understand that you have further questions to ask us , inspector thomas ?
and this will annoy him still further .
at the moment he was trying to hang his hat on the radiator of a car , and missing it by some inches every time .
she said slowly : i thought it was a man .
but our problem lacks the usual romantic touches .
i thought you wouldnt .
poirot had been justified in his premises .
not that i heard of .
ii in a large , hot , ornately furnished drawing room two women were sitting .
you are m .
mcnabb , that you seem to have an answer for everything .
i know the police have got to worryits their job .
talks a lot of nonsense , but shes a sport .
dont know that i ought to tell tales out of school , replied the major irritatingly .
he sat down at the table , produced a very shabby pocketbook , and proceeded to read from it in a monotonous voice .
raymond said : but she was !
if we get rid of her in about an hour , that would be all right , just to think over things a bit , and then mrs .
one more patient to see .
row with the management , i believe .
chapter _num_ the three men greeted clarissas announcement in silence .
look here , griffith , do they know anything ?
all well up master carls street .
that must be deuced awkward , he remarked .
he wanted to finish his picture .
tears blinded gwendas eyes .
but now you will have a comfortable income , wont you ?
yes , madame , he said .
i can understand , he said , that youd like to get it over .
erskine and was told she was out .
its us !
anyway it doesnt matter .
grainger , for this intrusion .
i picked it up and brought it here .
let me ask you a question first .
but the times come .
youd laugh .
frobisher went out through the open door , and poirot followed the admiral .
two preparations for a childrens party usually give far more trouble to the organizers than an entertainment devised for those of adult years .
she had run out , she explained , of this particular brand of wool and had a little jacket she needed to finish .
we thoughtwe all thoughtsomething queer was going on .
a funny thing , though , heredity .
besides , hes travelled and been away from en gland so much .
guy carpenter .
having got the woman in a friendly mood , he was now proceeding to throw away his advantage .
i flew over five days ago .
he himself had been recognized and all the rest of it .
instead he discovered a hornets nest of espionage and conspiracy , and his wife running the show .
motive , revenge .
gray get sadly discouraged .
bonjour , hastings .
after tea he went up to see miss ramsbottom .
elizabeth , she said , if i should die on friday night i should like that note given to dr .
i could swear that the agony in that cry of hers was genuine .
then he decided to let it go at that .
on a wide shelf were hats .
oh , poor isaac , said tuppence .
i i found her .
she could organize the staff of a big office in such a way that it ran as by well-oiled machinery .
i suppose you know most of the gardens round here , said giles encouragingly .
henrietta said slowly : so you think i killed john ?
anthony marston wasnt a suicidal type .
he paused and then broke out , why , lucy wouldnt talk to a scullery maid the way that woman talked to you .
he wouldnt think any such thing , said caroline .
i have need of assistance .
i couldnt start off gaily with a few pounds in my pocket and no idea as to what i was doing and where i was going .
tressilian came in slowly .
but it happened every time !
you cant sit in the house with the blinds down forever .
she simply said that she was tired of it all .
he added with a wry and ironic smile , i shall have to go to miss marple and get briefed on local matters .
his arm was round her , holding him to her .
find out who held mortgage .
poirot , mrs .
i know men pretty well .
i was saying , monsieur , that a bagatelle of one hundred thousand francs would satisfy myconscience .
she advanced a step nearer , and continued vehemently : perhaps i shall see it .
is it agreed ?
she isnt often excited .
but he will insist on reading themand then , of course , it upsets him .
hes very nice , harry is .
the boys , in spite of aggrieved protests , had been left behind at rutherford hall , but they now appeared grinning from ear to ear .
my method was to pull truelove to the top of a long grassy slope , settle myself carefully , utter an encouraging sound , and off we went ; slowly at first , gathering momentum whilst i braked with my feet , so that we came to rest under the monkey puzzle at the bottom of the garden .
thats the official view , and they know whats necessary .
it is retarded under certain conditions , none of which , however , appear to have been present in this case .
but the attempt was made .
is that what you started to say ?
a last cup of tea !
kipling tells us , is : go and find out .
seei will give you a last chance .
of all the people on the train , i alone had probably the best motive for killing him .
i thought id go on to the next thing .
oh , dont be an ass , bridget .
he has neither the nerve nor the daringnor , i may add , the brains to plan !
the words stuck in her throat but she got them out .
when you dropped out we couldnt think of anybody suitable to ask at the last minute .
it will be strange if , after that , we do not hold a clue to his mysterious murder .
carter dryly .
i dont want to distress you by staying here too long , madame , or to ask you difficult questions .
i should say miss turner was a hard-headed , ambitious young woman , with a good temper and considerable joie de vivre .
but it is strange .
there is a demand for such things .
well , that boat wasnt there , not when i saw it last .
i had to go down to the kitchen and warm it up myselfand make myself a cup of teato say nothing of stoking the boiler .
clipp said doubtfully .
said sir charles , resuming his own personality and speaking with modest elation .
alone with her visitor , a subtle change came over nadinas smile .
you could not be expected to do so because , naturally , you knew nothing of the background or of the facts except as they were given in the law reports .
i depend upon you more than you know .
daniels leans out of the window , and , probably with the aid of an instantaneous anaesthetic , such as ethylchloride , the chloroform trick is repeated .
if hes willing to forgive and forget im willing , said simeon .
satterthwaite stood stock-still .
the pearls were taken by a kleptomaniac who has since returned them .
do you know , the other day i was just admiring a baby in a pram and suddenly i felt a tug and there was augustus trying his hardest to bite through his lead .
you cant reasonably expect more dollars than ive got .
you see , she began at last , living alone , as i do , in a rather out-of-the-way part of the world , one has to have a hobby .
her books have sold over a billion copies in english with another billion in _num_ foreign countries .
and it really needs it , she murmured aloud .
luke , seeing no advantage to be gained by remaining , finished his beer and departed .
from a long envelope in his hand , he drew out an enclosure .
she knows what shes saying !
she turned her head in surprised recognition .
so all you know , said poirot accusingly , or all you can tell me is that the girl was a poor little rabbit , whom you saw in a typewriting office , where she had torn the heel off her shoe in a grating he broke off .
now lets get down to brass tacks .
there is something something ?
clare did not listen very attentively .
youve said enough .
but caroline was always on my side .
it was a delirious day .
what are they like ?
just an idea of mine .
vandemeyer complied .
she went , but about half past nine she returned to fetch the pattern of a blouse sleeve which she had promised to a friend .
that gave us an empty place .
going slow and whistling he was .
thats my advice : let well alone .
cust remarked : nasty businesseh ?
clarissa continued , just suppose that he was surprised to see me .
blenkensop met mr .
shes not been here very long , came here just after the grants did .
lynn broke off a leaf and chewed it meditatively .
im worried about that girl .
and today especially i have no appointment , said miss marple , but i will wait , she added .
were pretty well agreed , said craddock , that theres nobody missed out from here ?
how do you keep people off ?
elderly women bore me dreadfully , said mrs .
he seemed unconscious of her presence behind him .
there are some drugs in the upper shelf of that cupboard that were once popular , but havent been prescribed for years .
they were looking for secret papers .
human nature is always interesting , sir henry .
one cheek was bulged with a sweet .
the screen hid the chest from the room .
you were the police officer in charge of the case ?
and she twinkled at him .
you have a lot to learn , young man , said mr .
(that is why mrs .
you know theres to be a fancy-dress dance business afterwards .
too many sacrifices asked of her ?
erskine , driven insane by jealousy ?
she had met and dealt with incipient disasters and turned them into triumphs .
he must have got away through the window , sir , before we got to it .
bradley looked me over .
i arrive immediately , replied hercule poirot .
you are not a lawyer no ?
when i return to london i will send you a present .
he found sheila perenna leaning over the terrace wall staring out at the sea .
she acts as medium , i believe .
he didnt object tohis wifes friendship with major rich ?
a little colour came into her cheeks , and the shivering diminished .
to meet you again is an unexpected pleasure .
she was in her element , she fitted in , she knew this world .
i am not a yugo-slavian detective , madame .
he tried to do something smart over money , and got found out at once .
he laughed , and rising , poured himself out another whisky and soda .
eve , my child , where can you have hidden it ?
he was so anxious , you see , to stop you and giles making investigations .
thats the spirit .
grange stared .
you will regret it if you do .
i want to know the meaning of all this .
even the people who wreck telephone boxes , or who slash the tyres of cars , do all sorts of things just to hurt people , just because they hatenot anyone in particular , but the whole world .
no foreign help , by the way .
my father said they would be everywhere soon .
come and have a look round , meadowes ?
thats tokay , said lucy , looking back from the door .
my wife worries too much .
yes , there is your fellow as you call him .
but , alas , mr .
there was a lot of stuff lying aboutmostly broken pots it seemed to meor else ones that were all mended and stuck together .
i shall be available at any time that you want me .
well , said tommy next morning .
absolutely and completely sane .
it was the kind of place that specialized in morning coffee , five different kinds of teas (devonshire , farmhouse , fruit , carlton and plain) , and a few sparing lunch dishes for females such as scrambled eggs and shrimps and macaroni au gratin .
he looked very beautiful , said hercule poirot .
when she is dead i will .
we talked the scheme over and finally my sister moved in .
poirot was silent and spence asked : what are you thinking about , m .
perhaps all of you .
the one who brought the racquet ?
sir george had the money .
its their pigeon .
i had em put away safely .
for the experiment to succeed , it was necessary to find two people with a great bodily resemblance .
i think i was suggesting she should let me know when she was , flee .
but , micky , you did think about her .
reed , but i rather imagine i used to give you piggybacks once .
adele said : shes really very useful .
she leaned her chin on her hand , dispirited .
she moved a step towards her husband .
so i walked all the way back .
im suggesting that you should marry me , midge .
the pale , shining fox furs , the heaped boxes of matches , that sudden imperfectly explained invasion on the saturday night , and finally henrietta savernakes revelations about john christow and veronica .
it unsettles him , said miss johnson earnestly .
very remiss , he murmured .
she had worked with great devotion and selflessness .
shall i enumerate them , or will you ?
she went into a bookshop with english books in the window , but a mention of the olive branch drew only a courteous shrug and shake of the head .
when we know that , we shall know everything .
sarah assented , but her thoughts were so clearly elsewhere that gerard observed her in some surprise .
and who do you suggest for your villains ?
ellen said , if you remember , that miss lawson was particularly anxious that the news that bob had been out all night should not get to miss arundells ears .
that water-in-the-cellar business , said mr .
i was glad to have it that way .
she had a headache , she said .
i want to look at a will , said frankie .
hilary looked down at the card which she could just see before they moved out of the lighted station : monsieur henri laurier the taxi drove briskly out of the town , through the country , up a hill .
there was a long silenceas though it took some time to drive the inference home .
yahmose said quietly : my father does not treat me in the least as he treats ipy .
it not only took us as passengers , it took a great many more bed-bugs .
several reasons , said philip .
a sad history altogether , so far as i can make out .
mitzi might be a liar (he thought she was) , but he fancied that there might be some substratum of truth in this particular tale .
' the scotland yard man agreed .
he smiled at us , patted us on the shoulder in a friendly fashion , and beckoned us to follow him .
because it had probably been already thrown away the day before .
both as a girl and a woman , she had always been able to conceal her feelings .
carrge , the commissary , and van aldin , there was a further person in the room .
back to london , my friend , there appears to be no mouse in this mouse hole .
the old boyish look came back to his face for a moment .
an unusual preference for a woman .
noits thiswell , perhaps you havent read about it in the papers .
i strongly suspect that ivan is none other than the famous number four .
satterthwaite been alone he would have found it hard to make crossfield unbend .
she was a happy person .
i have been interested in her for some time .
i always use barbara interrupted her .
it is understood , then .
kelsey say that there was a french monk there , and i now saw that father lavigny was wearing a monks robe of some white woollen material .
were great favourites of mine about then .
on the entrance of jane the bored friend stopped her languid survey of the sketch and subjected jane to a piercing stare instead .
coffee , then , madame .
he held out the pistol .
i know what you mean , said midge thoughtfully .
the only person who had shown absolutely no desire to talk to me in any way , or on any subject , was philip .
there was a dago there whose life i had saved if i were you , jimmy , i should write a short book entitled lives i have saved .
so that was it , murmured poirot softly .
be it so , then .
youve no idea whether shes married , for instance ?
sowelli had to get out .
sort of velvet or corduroy .
have you got any line on reddings movements earlier in the day ?
i believe hes always been the same .
poor thing , she was all in a flutter .
i realise that , said valerie drily .
i was about to argue the point hotly , but at that moment the door opened .
but the whole point is , you see , that i dont know .
he climbs up into orourkes room , knowing that orourke has had a sleeping draught administered to himby the countess somehow or other .
not with the place .
despard looked at him , smiled slightly and said : dont you ever have a failure , m .
something dreadful .
he shook his head , then suddenly recollecting his duties , hurried from the room .
cocaine poisoning .
do you agree with my view ?
but at last , shaken and tossed from side to side , exhaustion had its way and she fell asleep .
somebody has been frightfully clever to have found out .
she sent me to you .
that seems strange to you because you are english .
ive got a rig out waiting for you .
they called her the frow line , or something .
horis tone was quiet .
the eyebrows had been trimmed to an entirely different shape , altering the whole expression .
then take despard .
cayley anxiously .
flusteredunsure of himself (slightly thrilled , though , at his importance) .
sarah considered for a moment .
i will pass now to my second question , said poirot evasively .
tomlinson , and then you can go on with what you were telling me .
do you recognise the paperweight , mr .
there was a strained sense of waiting .
the port passed once more , and lord mayfield referred lightly to pheasants .
there was no expression in the words , but giles wondered what he was thinking about .
he was breathing rather fast .
evelyn howard had been right in her facts , though her animosity against alfred inglethorp had caused her to jump to the conclusion that he was the person concerned .
that the man in the brown suit is better looking than poor mr .
she came across to him .
indeed , as months passed and nothing happened , it became an uproarious and cheerful gathering .
tuppenceyou congenital idiot , what made you do that ?
he wont want to disturb them , so he wont know that youre not really dead .
ah , said miss marple , but we havent all got such iron nerves as you have , colonel bantry .
' ' impossible .
well , chief-inspector ardwyck fenn looked down at the card in his hand .
yet somehow i got very strongly the impression that there was something elsesomething of quite a different nature that mrs .
that is your mission , sir stafford , said mr robinson .
lets get out of it .
ill tell her , said tommy with a faint grin .
then you do object ?
i respect you for them .
you didnt keep the letter , mr .
then , there are quite a few things you didnt tell me last night , arent there ?
old women knew the value of lifeand knew most of the tricks too .
weeds grow like house afire .
sans souci was hard at work on its midday meal .
you are rather a nice person , henrietta .
no , as you say , its ridiculous .
subnormal .
i am usually an excellent sleeper , said sir oswald .
emily brent thought to herself : i shall be getting a free holiday at any rate .
frederick had a younger brothera boy of ten or twelve at the time of our marriage .
the alibi coming with such suspicious promptness is inclined to raise doubts in ones mind .
beauvais ?
ce cher woolworth , i imagine .
did you ever get him ?
as a matter of fact , theyre a bit youngbut i was thinking of giving teddy a meccano set for christmas .
he was somewhere else at the time .
she was playing nervously with the tassel of her gown .
happened to meet her just now .
was he usually an early or a late riser ?
not the sort of thing poirot would relish .
superintendent blacker told me about you last night .
they all seemed quite unconcerned .
three people are dead .
we proved ourselves novices in another way which had disagreeable results .
we couldnt have allowed that .
but a scapegoat was needed , and kelvin was ideal for the purpose .
it is an indulgence .
they had been listening for the last few minutes .
this time i provided a love affair for hastings .
he had black hair , small keen eyes and a tendency to a double chin .
she is really well worth seeing .
i have to get there now .
where did she keep them , he wondered .
he picked up his little suitcase , and we went out through the open window in the drawing room .
when you came into the hall , was everybody else there ?
it was my cardthe one i sent with the flowers .
ask the doctor if i ought to take things easy .
i dont believe it would have been any good if she had left the island , said pamela .
suddenly , without any warning , the window burst open , and miss saintclair staggered into the room .
im going to look into this .
im going to make myself into a man instead of the loathsome creature i am because of you .
japp said with emphasis : im going to get to the bottom of this case , poirot .
does any line of inquiry suggest itself to you ?
two years have passed and i am sitting on my grandmothers lap , being solemnly trussed up as a chicken just arrived from mr whiteleys , and almost hysterical with the wit of the joke .
in the kitchen miss gilchrist was drinking tea and conversing affably , though with slight condescension , with mrs .
very narrowing , and though he had spent a good deal of his life in india , im afraid he never took advantage of the spiritual opportunities .
yet not even miss marple can foresee the violent chain of events set in motion when an eccentric guest makes his way to the airport on the wrong day of note : bertrams was inspired by browns hotel in london , where the author was a frequent visitor .
how clever of you to know that .
your other clocks seem all to be just over an hour fast .
the porter said cheerfully : rightyho .
then she told him of georges insistence on the sum asked for the cottage .
you know , fmance is an absolute mystery to me .
a sane person shut up in a lunatic asylum often ends by becoming insane , they say .
it was a silly little face , good-natured but with nothing particularly interesting about it .
youre a cunning old dog .
the girl hes married seems all right .
exexhumation ?
its possessiveness i dont understand .
but her husbands standing firmnot to be bullied and not to be bribedi admire him for it .
you are quite right , he confessed .
wouldnt you like something ?
shes a little devil , burst out barling .
no , he said , theres been no damage of that kind here .
claudia would have kept her head .
oh , come on , anne , lets go and see the old boy .
he was cast down and despondent .
its just one of those things !
in a minute , when ive done with you , youll go to bed as i told you to .
its a problem .
i mustnt imagine things , i mustnt , i mustnt , susan whispered to herself .
there is in this crime such a restricted circle that it cannot possibly take long to arrive at the truth .
for a moment we hardly knew what we could do .
with the force of the blow poirot staggered and all but fell .
the boys of the family and i used to vie with each other as to who could eat most on christmas day .
yes , were a narrow-minded , self-righteous lot , only too keen to judge matters we know nothing about .
its not inherited by a female , but it passes through the female .
i have been the good dog following up the scent , and not taking my nose from the trail .
you damned interfering nosey parker .
the first had been merely an indiscretion , and so was seldom referred to by the lady .
but you should know , at least , who killed nortoneven if you are still in the dark as to who killed barbara franklin .
yes , mademoiselle .
eventually , i mean .
it is the kind of weapon a woman might possess , rather than a man .
very narrow .
i will take you to sister barker .
his death occurred on that first evening .
well , i thought you must because because of what ?
but why ?
very pretty wifequite youngfair-haired , wanted to be near her people or something like that .
all girls do .
the door opened and a tall woman entered and said , katrina .
i may have to pay a deposit .
not he .
' 	he added with a grim expression on his face : ' i am a good witness .
his back , of course , was to them , and he merely loomed up as a monstrous shadow .
this pretty well cooks mrs .
ah , said constable palk again .
he went to the desk , turned over a ledger , scrawled something on a card and brought it back .
and then , at the supreme moment , his part runs away with himhes more than a burglar .
hes not that kind of a worrier .
we obeyed the cue and took our departure .
ive had him shadowed , of course .
in what way can i be of use to you ?
so often .
and so tothe last step .
i came to you because it was the only thing i could think of .
its awfully difficult at first , you know , because people look rather alike and wear the same sort of clothes and you dont know at first which is which .
do know who that is ?
leidner was rather like thatalways taking little kay for a ride .
why didnt you tell me this the other day ?
badger drew his colleague a little aside .
pearson ?
and now it seems that shed never even seen miss percehouse till this morning !
it was dark inside the cupboard .
were they interesting books ?
it is some years since i had the pleasureyou may not even remember oh yes i do , mr .
raynor stepped back a pace , and spoke sharply .
she was a platinum blondebut not a glamorous blonde .
) im afraid i was , i said .
cried poirot anxiously .
thats not quite the term she used , but something like that .
gets a better salary here than she ever drew on the stage .
she reached rashid street and turned to the left .
yesterday afternoonevening to be exact .
bryan martin give himself the trouble to come and tell me all these lies ?
how terrible for poor mrs .
it is a great test to re-read what one has written some seventeen or eighteen years later .
i still exist .
were all here to enjoy ourselves .
_num_ air service to paris .
patrick redfern called : hullo , arlena .
it was , in fact , the kind of room whose owner , the young men felt sure , would be difficult to explain to .
she begged us to keep the child .
eleven the egoist i do not think poirot had expected any other answer to his question .
well , couldnt you find out more ?
but how extraordinary taboos are .
the two friends had lost sight of each other .
was yours on time on friday ?
tough , i should describe her .
carlile greeted this remark was somewhat pointed .
a bad day of the week .
hercule poirot said : one has , in talking to people , a certain impression .
one remark you made interested me .
with an uneasy feeling that miss lingard was probably humouring him at this moment , major riddle went on : your work here was to help sir gervase with the book he was writing ?
the colour ebbed away again from his pale face .
it does not say so explicitly .
i dont know anything about the rucksack , or the electric lightbulbs , or boracic or bath salts , and the ring was just a mistake .
exciting , thats what it is .
why not mrs .
military matters were appropriately embodied in : there was a little man and he had a little gun .
miss grey , will youwill you have lunch with me ?
one glove is like another .
makes one feel jumpy somehow .
its nice to know we all get money for nothing sometimes , she murmured to jimmy .
but she was not allowed to see anyone .
how long had she been with you ?
all throwing suspicion on mr .
he was sore about it , yes , admitted nurse hopkins .
alibis , said rosamund cheerfully .
it had that childish incomprehension of pity which is so terrifying if met with in an adult .
it upset him very much .
she struck me as extremely capable and businesslikeperhaps a shade too much sobut very reliable .
well , ill speak the truth .
ah , a no !
i cant quite see i broke off .
we had some excellent mutton , large slabs of watery cabbage and some dispirited potatoes .
as poirot put it , things didnt sound so bad .
he seemed to be watching her .
the maidwhat was her nameellen , helped me .
i gathered it was a kind of open verdict .
and she might not suspect at all .
tina said : youre not going toyou wouldnt micky gave a short laugh .
but that raises rather an interesting question .
i think he credited poirot with motives that were none too pure .
said george encouragingly , perceiving that there was more to come .
he left the room , closing the door behind him .
i mean , that theres nothing between lawrence and me .
i didnt expect you yet awhile .
poirot didnt want me to hear what he and mr .
he appointed last night at nine o ' clock .
but aristide said , shes been here so long .
were later than usual .
he wrote back pointing out that it would be rather a foolish thing to do .
andersen , i said , i am not so badly off as that .
no one was about .
poirot had taken the trouble to arrange our interview beforehand , as he knew madame olivier never received anyone without an appointment , being immersed in research work most of the day .
none of these things last , these emotions !
he pressed it close to his side .
colonel pikeaway sat next to tommy , who had , rather doubtfully , offered him one of his own cigarettes .
were they on very friendly terms ?
he expects you , yes , said lisa neumann .
both young women spoke to him shrilly .
griffin could tell you a few things .
colonel clapperton seemed to welcome this suggestion .
he could always come to life at any moment .
about uncle timothy ?
perhaps but id prefer a firm offer .
ii didnt mean , i began .
and hed go back with such an innocent face that durned if they wouldnt say it must have been the cat , though ive never known a cat eat a gooseberry pie !
if its terms were made public , it would mean disaster .
now then , he said , lets have it .
think back , anne .
i dare say murders are two a penny in majorca and ibiza , not majorca .
i couldnt see any way out .
i have a lot of influence over her .
rafiel in beach attire was incredibly desiccated , his bones draped with festoons of dry skin .
he was coming herewhen ?
unfortunately , i did not get what i wanted .
thank you , she said , after a moments pause ; i should like to very much .
im staying , said giles .
i am afraid no owing to you .
she said abruptly : howard wants me to marry him .
they are uncut diamonds .
but it was someone desperate enough to shoot her dead .
we made a mistake .
i think it is essential !
i would think , half drowsily , that i heard the siren , or bombs not too far away .
i dare say im a fool , she said .
then he said : our inquiry rests there .
and the line of approach ive thought up is quite good .
when did you last see madame doyle alive ?
they wanted to know the details of my literary earnings .
yes , i suppose they do .
sometimes that leads to their taking their own life .
both respectable middle-aged men .
youve got to admit it hangs together .
she had a lot of dark hair , and she looked rather like a red indian ; she had not that pink , bald look that is so depressing in babies , and she seemed , from an early age , both gay and determined .
my story begins there , in the metropole hotel , one thursday evening in january .
oh , i see , you dont believe me !
archie wanted enid .
and then i say to myself , since there is here something that i do not understand , it would be well that i should investigate the matter .
how thrilling , said violet .
ive been thinking about it , you know , a good deal , and ive had several ideas .
sir arthur stanley was an old friend and client , was he not ?
she put sugar in the tea , a good deal of it , and gulped it down quickly .
i see , said neele .
it was an interesting question .
fans of the later novel murder on the orient express will not want to miss this journey by rail and poirots eerie reenactment of the crime .
a local police officer had met us at the station and had put us au courant of the situation .
it was , max said , like the pottery found at tell halaf in syria , but that had always been thought to be much later , and in any case this was of finer quality .
and yetthere was somethingonce or twice the chairmans hand had wandered to his face .
its of no consequence , said the judge .
perhaps , she reflected , the whole world was really crookedor was it just that she herself had been unfortunate ?
oh , nonot that !
and then , before id had time to say anything , i tumbled to it that it was me you suspected , not bella !
parker pyne sounded almost paternali know all about it .
oh , the thing worked like a dream .
you really think that is possible ?
does the sister know anything ?
here there was no youththere might never have been youth .
at five minutes to twelve mr .
throughout everything she remained attractive and charming .
the wind had freshened .
no , its another one .
a perplexed expression passed over his face .
lets have them .
with it i wore a smart little toque in greenish brown shades of velvet and a birds wing .
perhaps you will just help me up the stairs .
but i had to go somewhere .
then it is my friends .
he was a man of considerable wealth and lived in a large house not very far from here .
i tried my uncle .
satterthwaite did not understand .
and that always was very significant .
your name !
then just before eight oclock , all he had to do was to go out , make a detour on to the road higher up and come puffing and panting into exhampton as though hed walked all the way from sittaford .
instead , i questioned both of them very closely about their masters condition on that night .
everybody agrees that his manner was absolutely normal and as usual .
so then , i give in my notice where i work .
there was another complication to your plans .
its dreadful , she said .
i suppose , said jimmy , that we are rather butting in on his preserves .
i dont know if shed seen a physician lately .
i was in the ironmongery business in kennington .
they moved into the big house when the old people died .
especially as she must see it every day , agreed mrs .
he raced back to lombards room .
at the end of it was a girl with two black spaniels .
it was to his tailor .
but , to the oriental mind , it was infinitely simpler to kill wu ling and throw his body into the river , and pearsons chinese accomplices followed their own methods without consulting him .
id better go round at once .
that would certainly be extremely foolish , sir rowland advised .
i know , hori , i know .
that was the operative sentence .
it fascinated me .
its so trivial , i explained apologetically .
well , of course , m .
she had taken to be very mysterious about her doings of late .
tuppence found everybody extremely vague on the subject .
satterthwaite sat down in an armchair near the doctor .
there were two lines of writing on it .
and then after a pause he said a namea french name it sounded likebut i maynt have got it right .
messieurs , mesdames .
soon afterwards it was learned that miss emily , not relishing the medical attention she had had , was declaring that in the state of her health she felt it her duty to be near the specialist in london who understood her case .
the person who was keen on it was bertie mayer , who had originally put on alibi with charles laughton .
at last the train started .
there had been no survivors except for david hunter and mrs .
all my suspicions of that man came back a hundredfold .
soon after this amyas crale comes out and brusquely tells elsa greer to come down and pose for him .
and then , said poirot gravely , the justice that he has so long eluded overtakes him .
the man is a frenchmani would take my oath on that but at that moment they were interrupted by the doctor , who was sitting back on his heels with a perplexed expression .
he was fairly abusive when he was drunk , wasnt he ?
oh , of course , it was quite all rightbut , you know , we have to be careful nowadays .
slowly he became aware of other thingsof cold cramped limbs , of hunger , of an inability to move his lips .
the masters waiting for you .
last night you found someone here .
you dont meanmurder her voice was horrified .
somebody held him down in the brookheld his head under water .
wonderful testimonials miss eleanor had with him .
they found their way across the kitchen without much difficulty and once more switched on the sitting-room light .
whats the matter , sugar ?
there seemed no sign of tooth-marks or holes .
it will suit your mournful style of beauty .
see , here in the telegram .
im going to write down everything in a notebook and then , when the police are completely baffled , i shall come forward and say , i can tell you who did it .
nobody else wants her .
grudging that dear old man a few extra years of life .
he looked at her questioningly .
do you know what the girl said ?
you were sellons partner .
unfortunately , that careless ellen broke my bottle this morning when she was dusting in my room .
what a scene it would make on the stage .
she talked eagerly and animatedly .
i stayed for a minute on the doorstep for a few !
you would not shrink from putting a stranger to a little temporary inconvenience .
then he looked down at his two hands and smiled .
inspector crome frowned .
only his eyes were the same as ever , shrewd and twinkling , and nowyes , undoubtedlysoftened with emotion .
she took the envelope and slipped her hand inside .
plenty of mrs .
i havent done anythinganything at all .
he has only a nasty cold .
battle , what has happened ?
i could see myself from outsidebehaving just as usual .
he went on , hoping to turn her thought into a new channel : ive great hopes of tina .
she had poured out words eagerly , rather incoherently , and his heart had warmed to her .
youre quite sure you hadnt seen her before ?
business , i suppose .
i think you indulged your sense of humour there , mademoiselle , and did not realise that you betrayed yourself in so doing .
you mean that thats where there must have been a reason for making the change , and there doesnt really seem to be a sensible one .
' ' for which one can hardly blame them , my friend .
oh sir , said this apparition .
mrs boynton said , smiling that very odd smile of hers : you seethey wont leave me .
but i knew that advertisement wasnt a joke , letty .
i presume he left the embassy either in somebodys car or by the back entrance disguised as a footman or something .
i hope they havent lost that photograph .
poirot paused delicately .
at one time secretary of state for foreign affairs , he had always bulked largely in the counsels of the empire , and his country seat , chimneys , was famous for its hospitality .
its only something to do with a window .
could he rustle up someone who had actually known robert underhay ?
turn to the future !
no , it was on the other side of the village .
im just going to take it down to the police station .
so i suggest you cut the cackle and come to the horses .
sandra , his dear friend and companion , his arrogant , proud , loyal sandra .
are you sure you can manage by yourself ?
roger chuckled .
ellen does not wish to leave , neele repeated .
wed done everything possible for her , sir .
marshall went off this morning and asked me not to tell anyone i had seen her , i jumped at once in my own mind to a certain conclusion .
and were you ?
once or twice she acted in a very peculiar manner .
one dignified letter sent via our ambassador in ruritaniaone unofficial ditto containing the dirt per q .
then the murderer goes out through the window , jars it shut , steps , not on the grass , but in the flower bed where footprints can be smoothed out afterwards ; then round the side of the house and into the drawing room .
so you probably know more about this hostel than anybody else ?
the old man said angrily : theres a squall ahead .
bearing all these things in mind , and being convinced that the murder was committed by a person closely connected with the dead man , i studied the family from the psychological standpoint .
listen , tommy .
he had missed mr .
percival walked up and down the room agitatedly .
the rose trellis at the lodge memory poured in waves over elinor .
edward , without more ado , made haste to turn the car .
our tramp took us in the direction of fernly .
no , said chief inspector kemp .
well , i suppose thats natural enough .
all this , however , you probably have already gathered .
im just dead beat at the end of the day .
it was just like the light that miss johnson and i saw before .
after blunt and raymond were in the room , or before ?
she couldnt have done anything .
' ah , there you are , reggie .
the number of the police station is so and so .
meaning jason rudd ?
you indulge in the fantasies of , if so-and-so had happened , i should have done so-and-so , or , if i had married so-and-so , i suppose i should have had a totally different life .
he got up and strolled away , whistling cheerfully to himself .
youd think someone would have noticed a strange woman in a car .
yes , i see you are .
dont you think you could possibly let us have it tonight ?
there might be something in this spirit business after all .
at least , thats what clarence said .
the mind is confused ?
in the high street .
the impossible , always i examine it very closely !
why are you going to south africa ?
police , indeed , she said .
god , how i hate the public school spirit !
one must have more time .
there is , i think , very little doubt what it was she saw , said poirot .
no sense in going a round of fifteen miles .
do you understand at all what i mean , renisenb ?
ive got the information you wanted , m .
he was in my car being given a lift to drymouth .
no , i didnt notice it .
id no idea you knew him .
do be careful .
not mrs conrad , clearly , but a member of her own family , her husband or son .
that seems to me a feasible solution .
but she was not really quite so small as she had decided to appear .
nothing would please me better than to see her giving a lovely performance , as lucy would put it , in the dock !
oh yahmose , im so glad its you .
rosemary and he must be more careful in future .
stuck again , you brute , you .
staverton was in the privy garden with a pistol in her hand from which two shots had been fired .
but like a fool i thought that she had made up her mind to accept the inevitableor else possibly she thought that if she carried on exactly as usual amyas might change his mind .
none whatever , said miss bulstrode unequivocally .
you know what exchanges are .
a very charming childa little over-quiet , perhaps .
why cant annie go ?
this is no business of yours to be in here .
she said : im going to bed .
the clothes mrs carrington was wearing were of a striking nature .
let me present monsieur kramenin .
one of them was down here the other day , said frankie .
miss lawson reappeared .
hes an awful liar , but i thought perhaps he ought to be questioned .
to persist in the line i spoke of would have been disastrous .
a genuine woman writer of those letters would have made her letters much more to the point .
hallidays he turns to the right as we did , he walks brisklyah !
this paint affects my heart .
shes in no hurry to marry and settle down .
they were shown into a small waiting room .
it was careless of him .
took small overnight case and went to sister at _num_ elmsleigh gardens .
it will be heavenly to get into the sunshine , sighed ruth .
in detective booksyes .
she shot a glance at him .
i dont know exactly what i do think .
i looked into it , around it , up above it and down below it , as you might say .
but shes a real sport , tommy is .
said miss blacklock , with quite a shade of reproach in her voice .
they seized our diamonds .
no , postern of fate .
tim kendal was nice to jackson and , quite , i should imagine , without ulterior motive .
her mouth was neither crimson nor scarlet , but a subdued wine colour .
i met her out there , of course .
most women would .
yes , it is odd .
robert underhay !
and it occurred to me that perhaps we might manage it at gulls point this summer .
addie , always the little lady , retained her self-control admirably .
lorrimer coldly .
yes , its a good gameif the detectiveerknows something about police work .
theres been a kind of coincidence and it mightonly mightmean something .
at last he heaved a deep sigh .
it is quite true that you could not have typed that letter and at the same time gone to the covebut there would have been time for you to have jotted down that letter in shorthandand for someone else to have typed it in your room while you yourself were absent on your murderous errand .
it was her only mental recreation .
can you rememberin mentioning itdid she look at you as though she wondered whether you had heard a different version ?
quite legal , though .
craddock looked grimmer still .
but it shall be returned to you as soon as possible .
you awful dog !
after all , the girls go out so often to different people at different places that they would be unlikely to remember if it had taken place some months ago .
she added , you must pull yourself together for my sake , dora .
poirot looked thoughtfully at her her slim well-preserved figure , her keen dark eyes , her grey hair ; a woman of forty-five who was content to look her age .
looked at me rather nastily .
nevertheless we cant leave the possibility of suicide out of account .
there was no carelessness .
but something is bothering you ?
it is not said anymore .
thats the way i see em , said naomi placidly .
and thenme , she said .
she didnt have no luck , miss helen didnt .
ii and now , i suppose , said tuppence , we shall never know what any of it means or what it is all about .
id swear to it anywhere .
sometimes they imagine themselves to be historical personages .
there is now no evidence available .
when the prescription was last made up , where it was usually kept ; patience and a lot of spade workthats what will do the trick in the end .
vandemeyer and another woman never left me for a moment .
the commander fussed into the house and out again , swept the horizon with his glass , outlined a whole system of signalling by the enemy to likely spots on shore , most of the evidence for which seemed to be nonexistent , and proceeded to give a gloomy picture of a successful invasion in the near future .
i dont want you knocked on the head and thrown into the tigris , darling .
because nine times out of ten it wasnt .
satterthwaite had met .
then she opened the drawer of her dressing table and took out a small ivory-handled pistolalmost a toy in appearance .
i will protect myself .
emily had a small square room , scrupulously clean , looking out and up to the slope of sittaford beacon .
it was when he was listening to a confused account of the missionary aims of the swedish lady that one of the wagon lit conductors came into the car and stood at his elbow .
but he wouldnt listen .
i am going to call upon her immediately i leave here .
i had been aware for some time of a bad ache in my neck and shoulder and began to be awakened every morning about five oclock with an almost unbearable pain in my right shoulder and arm .
im afraid you cant get it now , i said .
she nodded in affirmation .
good gracious , poirot , i cried , laughing .
i dont think weddings are nearly as pretty as they used to be in our day .
she worked in switzerland , i thinkor was it portugal ?
if i had known it , thenthen of course i would have spoken outno , it was just a fear .
she asked in a low sweet voice .
then she wheeled the table up beside him .
he looked sharply at the placid old lady with the white fleecy garment on her lap .
he told me he had been buying cyanide of potassium at your request to take a wasps nest .
why does one like teaching ?
the woman who was sitting writing at one of the tables in the writing room of the durham hotel turned her head and then rose , coming towards us uncertainly .
youve talked to her during this trip ?
the woman gave a piercing scream and turned to fly , but poirot was standing in front of the closed door .
its nothing , i said .
if you knew anything about acting youd be able to understand quite easily .
john said : a lucky finesse , in a cheerful voice .
but thiswas murder .
she could , in fact , have bitten out her tongue for stupidity a moment later , but the words had been said , and mr .
then mr adams shot himself .
yes , aunt jane , we are expecting something really spicy , chimed in joyce lemprire .
why , when he came to this room , did he not at once feel for the light and turn it on ?
satterthwaite found him really interesting .
but according to him that is all wrong .
they are administered by three trustees , of whom i am one , leo argyle is one and the third is an american lawyer , a distant cousin of mrs .
now , monsieur poirot , shall we visit the place where the crime was committed ?
it put betterton tops .
alfred lee i felt sure was quite incapable of an act of violence .
well , thats quite likely , from all youve been telling me about his exploits .
chelsea , i understand , and all that .
he couldnt be a pal , said orourke with decision .
he was a notable example of the fact that nothing can be duller than dull pornography .
' ' really , i didn ' t notice .
did you ever read peer gynt , mrs .
i want to see miss kingston bruce .
the indignity of it all !
it seemed that miranda had become a drug addict .
i could say that mrs .
alicia coombe entered and sybil turned sharply .
chief-inspector davy shook his head .
i do not care about all this !
youve got a superb actor manager running the show in henry .
poirot removed his hat politely and mrs .
they finished the meal .
it was one of us .
i shall be so interested .
he could understand how for one moment in the fog he had taken elvira blake for bess sedgwick .
hollaby was replacing the pin in the hole .
hercule poirot waved a hand .
it was just half past nine .
her dear old master dead , and she no doubt brooding and feeling herself suspected ofoh !
shall i want to do that ?
the stout commercial traveller dropped his notebook and tugged at something in his coat pocket .
a pencil , i pray you , and a form .
cherry gave a vigorous nod of her head backwards towards the door behind her .
im very fond of youbut im an adult woman and my life is my own .
exactly , monsieur poirot , said the lad .
it couldnt be anyone else , said bobby .
an answer to prayer .
not necessary , perhaps , but it would be pleasant .
i noticed that his own hand was shaking a little as he stretched it out to his glass .
the latter shook his head .
this time i mean to be a bit slow about ittake my time .
he started to go , then stopped and turned back to the man .
oh , well , i may come to that yet .
anything for dry land .
that we should both be returning to england on the same train .
it may be my fancy , said tuppence suddenly , but i feel as though there was someone behind us .
rowley struck his fist on the table .
both of them , i found , had been heavily tipped on the day in question and one had duly won .
the trouble with you , murgatroyd , said miss hinchcliffe , is that you wont try .
it needs a big family for that !
at the hospital , i know , we never had them .
looking round her now , she exclaimed impulsively : i do like this room .
im a rough fellow , no use in society .
and your other patient ?
i feel that every bit as much as you do .
i dont think well write .
oh , well , one way of passing your evenings is as good as another , i suppose .
iohyes , we always move about among the guests and things like that .
poirot , said inspector morton .
he seemed a pleasant young man , yet there was something about his personality that rather repelled me .
he was very fond of midge .
i shall go up and rout him out , said tuppence .
it may have been just an ordinary coshing on a foggy nightand precious little hope of finding who did it unless we have a piece of luck .
she swore that she was innocent , but old baron hugo didnt listen .
but it would take more than the supernatural to frighten him .
i wonder nowi wonder now what youd say if jake levitt should remind you of the fact ?
its a classic .
besides , added the lawyer drily , i dont think she has anywhere else to go until she gets another situation .
he offers them to you for , perhaps , seven thousand pounds .
its just a headache .
and then we have mrs .
she did not go to church but read her bible at home .
a vast herd of students , of criminals who have been released from jails , some of them who have committed the crime of homicide .
naturally i did not speak of that letter to m .
and old gerrard told me when he was ill that mary wasnt his daughter .
perhaps it never left it , suggested the lawyer gently .
his action was rather precipitate .
i never stick to regulation hours , she explained .
he was alert , watchful , suddenly cold within .
they were together .
very glad to get hold of this gentleman , said the inspector , indicating his prisoner .
he paused and then added slowly .
i talked to her the other day at the sale .
this time i didnt .
though many passages survived unchanged in dead mans folly , especially at the beginning of the book , there are notable differences as the story develops and changes direction .
he had worked under him when the latter was home secretarya big blond man with laughing blue eyes .
on tip-toe gwenda crept away and round into the drive again .
hardcastle looked at the fingerprint man who was standing by the door .
i know , said jason .
something quite simple .
ive got the most extraordinary story to tell you .
for all we know the person who killed him may have had reasonsample reasonsjustifying that action .
probably they will .
m _num_ or the m _num_ .
he remembered them both .
thats over , and not so very terrible .
that came first .
both couples were dancing .
of course im not going to marry don .
drowning in treacle , he said under his breath .
you wanted me to find that amulet .
but it was the only help ted could give him .
look back through history .
eight detective-inspector lejeune heard the well-known tune father oflynn being whistled outside in the passage and raised his head as dr .
he greeted elvira with warm friendliness .
my dear poirot , i am sure you are capable of thinking of seventy !
the address ?
if anything happens to me , my friend , you will find here he patted the locked despatch case by his sideall the clues you need .
she was nearly desperate .
he had the most disagreeable woman for a wife that ive ever known .
it was quite on the cards that julius p .
she brushed a few stray pieces of half-consumed apple from the jutting shelf of her bust and then shook herself rather like a large newfoundland dog .
fortescues desk in his study here .
yes , pleasedry martini .
she had been only able to repeat her brothers name in that dazed tone of wonder and horror .
he was painting with a kind of frenzy , and nothing else mattered .
his mind was soon made up .
they seldom object .
im glad youve led such a pure life , bill .
you heard him ?
yes , it makes it look rather black for master frank .
special editions for children nowadays .
its my sister you are talking about .
we now come to miss king .
jeremy said stiffly : when you were good enough to marry me , you had the right to expectwell , integrityand a life free from sordid anxieties .
i couldnt think what i was frightened of , but i was frightened .
so everything fitted in .
the woman who was on her way to join the man she loved .
monsieur , i said with dignity , it is not for hercule poirot to run up and down the evil-smelling streets of limehouse like a little dog of no breeding .
i let loose at her one daya string of savage , unwarranted abuse .
she heard nick rush down the stairs and out , and she herself came into the hall to find out what had happened .
my dear boy , what do you mean ?
blore felt that he could enter into any society unchallenged .
' he stopped , thinking over the possibilities his word implied .
then , as though hypnotised , she spoke as quietly and naturally as a child .
you would not suppose so , hastings .
i wonder if , possibly , the sneeze that the maid , clara , heard might have actually been the shot ?
she was born before my time .
his mouth was pushed out in a pout and that made him look more like a nice clean pig than ever .
i am interested yes , i am distinctly interested .
bernard parker might easily have dropped one or the other but hardly both .
what a tragedy , said poirot , but in a more everyday tone .
and elsa walked by herselfsmiling .
it was she who gave sir stafford nyes address to the chauffeur .
he observed , and this time succeeded in sitting up .
but , my dear lady , i told youto inquire into the death of mrs .
the operation was , as always on these occasions , completely successful .
the curious thing is that by the time she was fourteen she adored fairy stories , and would read books of them again and again .
ask him to join us here , please , said jason rudd .
ellie murmured : so you thoughtit might endthis way ?
i thought it had always been the laurels .
he will not take refusal .
tell me more about colonel protheroe .
so far that seems sensebut i dont see by what process of reasoning you fix on nicholson as the criminal .
i found your outer office empty and this door open , so i ventured to intrude .
put you where you can do no harm in case your friends come after you .
about fifty-one or-two , he supposed .
i recounted all this to poirot .
oliver , letting a new idea come into her head .
leidners life .
different kinds of danger suit different kinds of people , said lord caterham .
somebody she saw , somebody who spoke to her , somebody who found out where she was .
a big bowl of steaming soup was brought in and placed on the table in front of her .
then he said : lady with a little girl , that was for mr .
you werent missed at lunch , julia , you know , she added , turning to the girl .
about sixty-five different fancy stitches .
aware of the ravages grief made in their appearance , they did their best to repair those ravages .
what exactly has she been doing to you ?
well , what happened next ?
beatrice moscombe , third housemaid .
now how did the woman know that i had been to visit mrs .
franklin and boyd carrington came in shortly after we got back to the house .
somebody , he said , has removed every photo of sonia goedler from this album .
i think ill take it .
miss king , who is a qualified doctor , examined the body .
what is in it ?
there was and is everything wrong with it .
one more question , doctor : would it be possible to introduce a fatal dose of poison into a chocolate ?
you asked no special questions at the time ?
as she left the room , he returned and stood behind the armchair , looking pensive .
her own vague hunch that it (whatever it was) had to do with edgar lawson seemed unlikely since ruth had not even mentioned him .
if she was really a cut above him it wouldnt matter , but the lower middle classtheyre very particular .
hadnt the nerve to go back to the inn .
why , noi wouldnt say that .
not at all , i said coldly .
you can smile at yourself later , saying , i was really rather a young fool .
look here , i think well have to give this up .
he sat down and studied the piece of paper that mrs .
i fixed my mind on my book .
remembered not for its likeness to himself , not even for its likeness to pamela , but for a closer resemblance still to this picture here .
prcisment , said poirot dryly .
lady yardlys portrait had figured too often in the society papers to allow her to remain unknown .
iicouldnt bear it .
and you know , people like emma crackenthorpe are the salt of the earth emmawell , emma means a lot to me .
on georges replying in the negative and introducing bundle , the countess gave her a careless nod , and at once resumed her conversation with the serious mr .
as a matter of fact , i came here to join forces with a sister of mine .
the income his father left him was a small one , yet he was able to live at a most expensive rate .
let us , i pray you , be very precise .
this he had almost succeeded in working loose .
they used to meet among the fruit trees .
lance interpolated .
she wouldnt let on to josie anything about itotherwise josie would say : no , you dont , my girl .
it amuses me sometimesespecially when one knows as well as i do how essentially law-abiding and respectable the poor fellow really is .
because maisie left the sentence unfinished , looking at her friend .
i cant bear to talk about it anymore .
just so , said battle .
after a brief interchange he replaced it and looked u _num_ " poirot .
he did not know exactly what to expect .
i never worry over people dying .
he disappeared into his bedroom .
hori , what did she see ?
and mine , said poirot .
forged antiquities .
lucy accompanied them willingly .
sarah .
lords transparent face .
my stepfather says it isnt legal .
suddenly i saw luxmore in the distance staggering off into the bush by the river .
this title was previously published as poirot loses a client .
it was the gong .
it was inspector sharpe .
im sure you are , said egg .
frankie , you wouldnt ?
i dont see how anyone could blame us for jumping to the conclusions we did .
and presently another went off , ringing with a crude , deafening note that would have aroused acute irritation in a deaf man .
the constable is up there seeing that no one tampers with them .
if she went along the top of the wall it might be better .
i brought it in here and put it away in its proper place .
and i can be very wrong .
all hands flew out in the same gesture which bundle had noticed before .
perhaps you cooked it all up between you ?
after a moments cogitation she locked the door of her prison on the outside and left the key in the lock .
i will ask you to make what allowances you can .
parker pyne , i will see that this woman does not leave this compartment till he comes .
why , i havent had a hatpin or a hairpin for the last four years .
i think that he and maude would both be pleased to come hereperhaps for a week or two .
then he spoke in french .
i wish youd get rid of that god-awful nurse , shes simply too arch for words .
i can tell you from my own enquiries into the official accounts of these two deaths , that they have remained a mystery .
satterthwaite left his new friends after having promised to take tea with gillian on the following thursday .
he its been remanded for a week .
ive got some old snapshotsin an album somewhereat least i think theres one of her .
there seemed nothing promising there .
so she didnt confess .
it was no moment , she felt , to listen to the further difficulties of beatrice .
sir george , said mrs .
poirot said gently , excuse me ; she did not tell me .
look here , burst out mr .
she wasnt happy about things , either .
good , said the doctor .
it was quite dark now , and i judged that the night must be well-advanced , for the moon was high in the heavens and shining down through the dusty skylight .
she had noticed that sister thrse had slipped into her sleeve a small and businesslike automatic pistol .
well , i may probably be quite wrong , but ive got a sort of idea that it was patricia lanes work .
i was now no longer so sure that sir eustace pedler was the colonel .
you know your voice is weak .
you haven ' t hurt yourself badly , have you ?
he tried in vain to dismiss the incident from his mind .
then , for what it is worth , i did form the impression that they knew each other well and were on intimate terms .
quain , of the alibi .
tuppence made a slight grimace .
bending over she kissed the old lady .
they seem to have remodelled it .
one harlequin dead on the floor , another harlequin looking through the windowor was it the same harlequin ?
yesflowersand weeds too .
she had passed mrs murgatroyd , pretending not to notice her , but suddenly she swerved back and went right up to her .
just show him that advertisement you told me about , mrs .
she was quite composed now , grave and cold .
the whole things a thoroughly well thought out businesslike setup .
its so difficult to know how people are going to take things .
youre a damned blackmailer , neither more nor less .
death , monsieur , must have been almost instantaneous .
oliver costellos body was still behind the sofa , but clarissa had been moving the furniture about , and had set up a folding bridge-table in the centre of the room , with cards and markers for bridge , and four upright chairs around the table .
miss arundell said with a slight smile : better not let the vicar hear you .
melchett said : takes her by car thirty-odd miles to put her in bantrys library ?
they drove on again across the flat interminable plain .
my dear young lady , as far as i recollect i only mentioned that there were equally good situations to be obtained elsewhere .
colonel johnson looked at him doubtfully .
franklin shot me an interested glance .
satterthwaite in a warm exhilarating flood .
she felt uneasiness rising .
she dismounted there , passed through an arched gateway and found herself , with a thrill of pleasure , in an oriental interior .
poirot paused with an air of waiting to be encouraged to go on .
and here was gervase going to ruin ruths life with pride and snobbery .
it was in your soup plate .
colonel carbury looked at him curiously .
ask me anything you like .
he declared that at twelve oclock he had heard two men quarrelling loudly in a room on the first floor .
for eighteen months .
i mean , only in a very general way .
she had heard the clock strike downstairshad heard owls hoot outside her bedroom window .
sort of thing you might dream of at night , she said , and gathering up various cleaning implements she departed from the fitting room and walked across the landing to the room on the other side .
i believe , if i predecease belle , the money would go to the legal offspringor whatever the term isof randalls only sister , sonia .
sweet gladys cram , you are no sham .
had agreed it was quite a coincidence .
i was having dinner in the nursery , jam roll pudding .
rycroft had suggested , someone else in the housesomeone who had overheard the quarrel and seized his chance ?
he fancies he hears a sound , and immediately , automatically , he pretends to be speaking to his uncle through the open door .
and youll get me out of this mess ?
is there nothing at all that you can remember which might help as a clue ?
it is the same thing , said mr .
really , said miss marple , i dont think i have ever behaved quite like that .
she walked about her flat in a rather aimless fashion , touching things , picking them up , putting them down , looking in the drawers of her desk , realising that there were plenty of letters there to be dealt with but feeling also that in her present state of virtuous accomplishment , she was certainly not going to deal with anything so tiresome as that now .
no , it is the paid companion who speaksthe girl whose duty it has been to put fresh water in the vasesand , allied to that , there is a girl who loves and notices jewellery .
a young italian acquaintance of theirs had gone out in a boat and capsized , and beatrice barron had jestingly named him boatsupsetty .
a small man , dark , with a high-pitched voice , said m .
dear me , said miss pierce .
' ' it was then that you decided to take a turn on the terrace ?
she said : im afraid of being killed !
foul play ?
that charming sympathetic manner of hers , so much appreciated by members of the male sex , did not for some reason or other commend itself to women .
but who was the man ?
rough luck on the little chap , he thought to himself .
dr gerard shrugged his shoulders , smiling a little at her earnestness .
he wasnt going to admit for one moment that hed been wrong .
he didnt miss marple hesitatedresent her action ?
cruel cold , bill said to im , and he just answered , whispering-like , yes , it is .
employ our little grey cells !
theyve had trouble with a chimney here .
colonel bantry was by now thoroughly awake and prepared to deal with the situation on its merits .
welman , why did she do it ?
a woman of very exceptional character .
ive a call to pay at a solicitors officeafter that , you can get me at the golf hotel if anything urgent turns up .
everything is as much of a deadly secret as though they were m .
i traced them to the kitchenbut not beyond .
but another voice spoke , imperturbable and calm , the voice of hercule poirot : i will inform you , if you like , monsieur .
poirot seemed in no hurry to begin .
it is of great importanceall this .
bushy eyebrows turned out to be professor wanstead , as she had thought , and the foreigner was mr .
nancy taylor !
wellyesactually i have , miss marple admitted .
it does from me .
still he was interrupted by a shout of triumph from the inspector .
wimborne gave him a shrewd glance .
i dont see why it would be a joke ?
yet in some way he could not yet see , it must make sense .
the other woman is countess andrenyi .
the result was an enjoyable comedy-thriller , spiders web , which made satirical use of that creaky old device , the secret passage .
i thought i recognized the voice , he declared excitedly .
his faults might lie in another direction .
one died in infancy .
he went back into his room , shut the door and was never seen alive again !
hell lie with a straight face till kingdom comesbut he cant be sure of her !
he could , of course , explain to the police it was awkward , no doubt about it , it was decidedly awkward .
, said eve to maureen .
he took it and turned the pages .
ruth said angrily : i think m .

she hesitated a moment then she went to the window , pushed it a little farther open , stepped out and turned her head back into the room as she spoke .
whats that about carlotta ?
a bad business , you say ?

she knew that he liked a good space of time in which to recover from the exertion of bathing and she had therefore reminded him of the time , allowing a good ten minutes for him to rebut her suggestion and then be able to adopt it without seeming to do so .
the only place he never came to was the house in elvaston square .
any money i make goes into my pocket and nobody can take it away from me .
the bright spot in my life was rosalind .

satterthwaite and slipped a hand through his arm .
this is the first time that i have been asked to turn my talents to elucidate the kidnapping of a pekinese dog .
and you suspect him of what ?
the chloroform had been only a whiff .
in a sense , no .
oliver , that you wanted to know something specifically .
but if so , kemp , im convinced he didnt know it was cyanide .
yes , and im damned if ill have him in my house !
poirot replied slowly .
youve missed one outwhen the missus and the bloke dressed up as a hospital nurse passed the waiter in the passage .
theres something damned odd here .
did you believe your own words ?
something quite unusual , that was .
she must have thought she thought seriously enough of what she had overheard to go to ireland and search for the truth .

youll have seen , i expect , in the papers that sir bartholomew strange is dead .
i wondered if youd woken up .
thats all i can tell you , said mrs .
and shes got a wonderful daily .

ii he did not rise to greet her .
you come to see me .
the countess rossakoff sighed .
i will give you yet another suggestion for a title .
an old lady was murdered here , or something ?
hope the george will put on a good meal , said major phillpot .
that was all that was necessary .
we all said the same things over again .
it was entirely a racing crowd staying there , and racing language and terms were incomprehensible to me .
will you go out and get a policeman , or ring up the police station from somewhere ?
dick took out one of his official cards and handed it to her .
its human .
well , listen .
it was soon after hed been up there that they discovered that sabotage businessjust in the nick of time .
the more we know the better .

which i have always felt most romanticsuch an enormous fortune !
this is she .
we could hear her voice .

have you still got it ?
i dont like it , said tuppence .
not too muchto overtire herself .
on inquiry she learnt that tommy had not yet returned .
with a great thump on the table , poirot demolished his carefully built-up edifice .
he paused a minute and then said : but my retaining the legal ownership , there were still possibilities left open to me of recovering my property .
the fuse box is in an awkward place .

i said to her .
i believe that girl has bowled you over .
the kings jester isnt .
i whispered eagerly .
her glance caught poirots and swept over him with the nonchalance of the uninterested aristocrat .
i saw her and i stopped .
what about bluff ?
but you see , i dont know anything .
suggestive , that , is it not , my good japp ?
what about the golden-haired wonder ?
only one person could have supplied her with itdavidson .
she had only to turn her head and she would see her .
he clutched poirot by the arm , and sank his voice to a whisper : just tell me this , mr .
only you know what the police might be like if they thought you werewellhiding things .
magda had talked to me in a sensethat is , i had formed part of the audience to one of her broadcasts .
some day , sooner or later , they will get me , he repeated .
no story for your damned paper .
he said : is that your way ?
there is nothing here .
she dismissed him with a brief nod and joined her new friend in the road .
did he want to escape ?
his mouth was grim .
where is your daughter now , madam ?
i thought she was going to ram the wall , but she just didnt !
it was suddenly cruel , that mouth .

kemp asked : miss lessing has gone ?
she and poirot were toiling slowly up to the rock overlooking the second cataract .
i never knew him out in the states , though i nearly met him more than once .
it seemed rather an anticlimax when , somewhat apologetically , poirot produced the package of liver capsules he had bought at the chemists .
then it must have been the work of a lunatic .
it was nobodys business to disbelieve that statement .
a summer frock , a sort of foulard silk .
another railway official was brought in , and confirmed the first ones evidence .
now she had gone back to be buried with her own folk , to where her own home was .

in the state of shock tina was in she would hardly have felt anything .

as soon as the other party had left the room , however , he too rose to his feet .
if he did not , should he risk trying to make an ally of her ?
tuckers voice from inside .
in fact , you can answer for him as being above suspicion ?
and i thought , suppose that woman was not molly ravenscroftbut who could she be ?

merrowdene of his own accord volunteered the information that he had just insured his life for his wifes benefit , and asked evanss opinion of the company in question .
but at that moment , mrs .
a few minutes later there was a tap on the inspectors door and sergeant jacobs appeared , ushering in a tall , moderately good-looking young man .
patience and faith .
how did her own child die ?
it knew she was not its mistress .
yes , i was going to bridgets but this changed thingsi dont understand about the message you got .
i know , said renisenb , helplessly .
notuckerton i paused .
because of his record .
supposing , hastings , that in each of these cases that i have outlined , there was one alien note common to them all ?
with her was her little girl , a beautiful child of five .
poirot murmured : i noticed in the waiting room a young man who looked exactly like a murderer !
it is a further point against him , said poirot ruefully .
an overmastering impulse drove her on to get rid of her husband because she was the sort of person who simply cant endure suffering of any kind , and theres no doubt that the wife of a man like ashley ferrars must have had to suffer a good deal i nodded .
it was a dangerous flight to undertake and it went wrong .
and theyre ever so expensive , these flats .
yes , said tuppence , and added , and its mrs .

i can only tell you that i would not have cared to entrust my own funds to george , and i suspect that richard abernethie , a very shrewd judge of men , was dissatisfied with his nephew and placed no reliance on him .
and being alone and reading the paper , i saw your advertisement and it set me thinking .
poirots laugh came at the right place .
chapmans papers ?
it does sometimes happen , i admitted .
shall we say that gradually i had perceived the advantages of severing whatyou will forgive my plain speakingi considered a degrading association .
forgive me coming so early , dear , but i thought , perhaps , you mightnt have heard the news .
he came into the room , i remember , acutely embarrassed , and it made him put on an appearance of jollitya kind of hullo , her we are .

jacqueline laughed .
she answered : becauseusuallyyou are such a gentle soul .
there was a wool shop which was clearly the aristocrat of the place .

miss martindales sandy eyebrows rose in surprise and a certain amount of displeasure .
thats what you ought to have done with george .

how satisfying it must have been for the great ladies in the days of the bayeux tapestry , in the long winter months .
nothing that she actually said .
i mean , does she strike you as a reliable , truthful person ?
she did not look at poirot , but down at the ground , and so was unaware of the keen scrutiny with which he regarded her .

hercule poirot debated within himself as to how he should approach the hollow .
and thenwhat shall it be ?
it is clear that you suspect either theresa or charles of having a hand in miss arundells death .
inspector grange was talking .
he looked at her steadily .
i cannot conceive what use one shoe could be to anyone .
still , its safer to keep her where she is for a day or two he got up , nodded cheerfully and went off towards the hotel .
she congratulated us .
russians to inspector curry were what bony had been in the early days of the nineteenth century and what the huns had been in the early twentieth century .
the little peer cackled with shrill laughter , his shrewd monkeylike face wrinkled with mirth .
how could you be soso mean .
but its lawyers , tuppence insisted .
but i was far too excited to go to sleep .
henry sutcliffe with intent to steal .
i have had a visiona most remarkable vision .
how magnificently the english hide their emotions .
murmured poirot politely .
but do you know what i think it is ?
but ive got to make her talkthats itmake her talk !
possible , agreed lejeune .
i must join her and give her the benefit of my system .
therefore , madame , i should be extremely obliged if you would place them in my hands without delay .
she expressed no surprise or emotion at sir charless overnight decision .
as though he were an inspired prophet who could not lie .
its the analysis of that coffee .
she was a catholic who attended st .
you came from the outer hallso .
he gets shakespeares and miltons works translated into arabic and kurdish and persian and armenian and has them all on tap .
curious , isnt it ?
it need not be .
i do not follow you , m .
forgive me , i pray .
she was conscious of georges apologetic gaze following them .
you are quite right , i know , but i should like it done all the same .
she added with emphasis : unfortunately !
they were all , roughly , in the neighbourhood of thirty .
on our right , through an open door , we saw the dining room with its long polished table lit with candles .
its very much like photography really , said dermot .
ive got a beautiful plan .
to speak outto tell allthat has its advantages .
hes on the starboard deck , madame .
the referencepayattentionis to miss springer .
jacqueline bent down and tied the lace of her shoe .
i am pretty sure that you will find that some of these things in your agreeable little purple-coloured notebook will have something to do with the past tragedy .
magda , on the contrary , burst into speech as soon as mr .
im going to climb over the wall and see if i cant get up to the house quietly without being seen .
how old ?
i knew the dates of the kings of england and the names of all their wivesinformation that has never been much use to me .
asked lucia .
he recalled three philosophic questions .
yes , sir , he was .
she then repaired with a handbag to the fastnesses of the ladies waiting room .
then why have you sat here all these hours , your forehead puckered , brooding and thinking ?
shanghai , shortly after the latter had left marseilles .
miss marple turned her head sharply .
crackenthorpe come in .
let me see , who is the man ?
how far would he carry that protection ?
mother , married son , his wife , one younger son and two younger daughters .
he spluttered and said he couldnt possibly manage with less .
read what ?
gregg escaped on his way to prison , he stole a car and had a crash while trying to evade the police .
tough customers , he muttered , with a chuckle .
well , said mosgorovsky , i dont think we need discuss matters any further .
leonard vole flushed .
but now weve got to work fast .
poirot said : if it should come back to you , perhaps you will let one of us know ?
she said : i dont know who you are , but youve got to understand thisbasil didnt do it .
i think hes up there with the master .
ruby wants to see him .
colonel johnson said sharply : did you see much of your grandfather when you arrived here ?
huish turned back to leo .
and what shall we set them at ?
gilling was a village which the world had left behind .
he was not and never had been a man of genius .
rather crestfallen , bundle retraced her steps .
wed get on much better without them .
i do not think he meant murder .
breathed anthony .
a matter of a yard or so made all the difference .
youve hit it !
satipy has an ungovernable temper , kait is often sulky .
looking rather smug , starkwedder smiled at the inspector who turned away angrily and swiftly left the room with the sergeant .
is that necessary .
if we ever find out , said tuppence gloomily .
hilary assured him smilingly in french that it did not matter in the least .
on the whole , i think rayburn was the best of the bunch .
you dont take me in with that old gag .
satterthwaite thought to himself : this means something different to each of us .
you have the gift of recreating the past .
etc .
nothing alarming .
poirot , im going to show you my garden .
poirot scribbled something on a scrap of paper and handed it across to m .
peter lord said rather incoherently : not at all .
during the second world war , when i was working in london , i wrote an account of our time in syria .
she looked at me inquiringly , but i wasnt going to answer that .
joan kench , betweenmaid .
hercule poirot immediately flew into a rage .
it must have been a great shock to any girl .
egg dismissed oliver manders with an impatient whisk of the head .
supposing my mother had gone to her and told her that she wouldnt divorce my fatherthat nothing would induce her to divorce him .
not a criminal type , said mr .
his legal instincts are too strong .
i want you to come to the larches with me .
i understood he was senator westerhams valet .
when you only look at one side of a thing , you only see one side , continued miss marple .
du tout .
was there anyreason for her calling on me ?
but the second is true .
well , yes , as a matter of fact , cancer .
madame giselle was dead chapter _num_ discovery henry mitchell , the senior of the two stewards , passed swiftly from table to table depositing bills .
wellwe were reading these books as i told you , and there was a boy on board who talked about exhamptonhe was so enthusiastic about it .
perhaps you knew mr .
a great precaution , but perhaps a day late , suggested poirot gently .
lee by sight ?
simply fantastic .
if so , i shall go out for a stroll .
did you notice anything , sister ?
well now , say i got the gun right away from him .
judith would have treated any remonstrances on his part with the smiling detachment of the young towards the boring counsels of the old .
one intuition succeeded another with remarkable rapidity and mrs .
suddenly we stopped .
that is entirely so .
the two young people .
he didnt , i tell you , lucia sobbed .
well , it just couldnt have happenednot the way they make outgiving a patient an overdose in injecting the gum , i mean .
there was a sigh from the medium , and then a groan .
this is secret history im telling you , socks .
you meanabout my fathers death ?
he would be kind , i was sure .
washingtons razed to the ground , europe has continual military actions , demonstrations , wrecking of airports .
like to see the picture of a murderer ?
elinor said dreamily : there was a mark on nurses wrist .
angela had only to appeal to her and mrs .
we could have broken open a window or something .
you could bring government pressure to bear on the police so that the whole thing is dropped and a verdict of suicide brought in .
i shall soon prove my identity .
envelope containing money to be put under stone behind a .
you wouldnt say so unless you were sure .
philip arrived late , nobody saw him but the night porter .
second rubber , miss meredith and i against despard and mrs .
' ' quite right , old cock !
and yet as rich as they make them .
kemp said : ill send off a cable at once .
well , anyway , this man , he went off down the road and telephoned from the call box down there .
they say what you want them to say as a mere matter of politeness .
a chess piece .
' s tillingfieet murmured , ' that ' s so - of course .
pratts ears it wont .
i said to taverner : how does she strike youmrs .
how lovely to be eleven years old and greedy !
she has passed a satisfactory night .
rowley cloade say that the deceased expected a visitor ?
not bad , said bunch , nodding , and ticking people off on her fingers .
it was about four days after this that the first incident happened .
before the fury of hate and malice in her glance , renisenb recoiled a step .
of course , one cant find out about things all those years afterwards .
ive taken a villa near algiers .
yes , sizes are so deceptive .
leidner was afraid of a definite flesh-and-blood person .
still my guide plodded on , turning and twisting through mean streets and byways , until at last he stopped at a dilapidated house and rapped four times upon the door .
she said : i never did anythingi wouldnt do a thing like that .
presently archie and belcher arrived , looking jaded by their efforts .
he said : and ive got to paint you that way !
we agreed to this suggestion readily enough , and drove there in a taxi .
its unlike anything thats ever been tried before .
dont get so heated .
dont you remember playing to me this morning ?
my dear poirot , i said , you know now what the enemy thinks of us .
and its a police car right enough , and theres two men gettin out .
no , said hercule poirot .
so off they drove to a honeymoon in italy .
of course , said mary .
she telephoned .
said mademoiselle blanche .
what had she said to edward ?
she found mrs .
we hurried out on the terrace where two constables were holding a ruffianly-looking fellow in shabby clothes , who was twisting and turning in a vain endeavour to escape .
its not really falling to bits yet .
with the utterance of the name the smile vanished from her face , and all the cordiality froze out of her manner .
wrapping the folds of his dressing gown round him , the old man half rose from his chair .
otterbourne , dressed in floating batik material , succeeded her daughter .
she might have seen someone she knew , for instance , and that might have put her in danger .
is there ever any particular spot where one can put ones finger and say : it all began that day , at such a time and such a place , with such an incident ?
there was a gardener , too .
argyle refused to give him money .
tommy called , as he came into the house .
you have no ideas yourself on the subject ?
ive paid for my ticket , said mr .
oh , i shant hurry myself now ive really got here !
oh , i suppose they wouldnt advertise the fact in the papers .
there was a change , he decided .
it had a kind of musing gentleness .
i dare say you dont , but i do , said dr .
not in the circumstances .
i rather wondered .
one can so easilyjust do without thingswhen its only oneself .
and the inside of their housesit would make you weep , dear lady , i assure you it would make you weep .
not in a dayno .
one shake detached the newspaper and there , before her , were the missing pair of boots .
mustnt keep the town hall waiting , the inspector agreed , following him .
that anyone who went against him suffered .
thats the f .
out there on the riveri was very happy .
goldand mrs .
the voice of george lomax , furiously upraised , came loud and distinct : who is in there ?
the most innocent occurrences lend themselves sometimes to a scandalous appearance .
file them , please , and answer what you can .
its a shame , said the girl called socks .
especially someone like miss springer who is not beautiful , at whom men do not even look !
ive been away for threefour years .
its coming into your life , too , but in your case it will be a kind ofof rejuvenating oneat least , i hope so !
the girl at the caf , for instance ?
yes , now you come to speak of it , i believe it was .
the boac notice on the door .
yet i must definitely range myself against him .
its dull work too .
llewellyn-smythe write her name , then that signature couldnt have been a forgery , could it ?
my dear aunt jane , why must you bury your head in the sand like a very delightful ostrich ?
the lucys all seemed pleased , saying , weve thought reggie had his eye on you , aggie , for some time .
why do we never see him ?
i dont like her at all .
she found her mate and claimed himno young romeo , a married , middle-aged painter .
social stuff invitations .
not , of course , at his inviting you .
he touched it and said : id like you to charge your memory with this , miss aldin .
gone off to play golf .
sir , said knighton .
rogers .
) did she know that she herself was mademoiselles residuary legatee ?
but it wasnt different , of course , it was just the same .
but if so , where was the girl , and what had she done with the papers ?
it was the little discrepancy in time that first drew my attention to youright at the beginning .
confirmed the fact that allen and plenderleith were on good terms .
can you help us there at all ?
eva kane remained behind to housekeep for him , and tongues soon started wagging .
unable to contain his feelings any longer , he burst forth : there is one thing no man can do , and that is to get a woman to listen to reason .
we reentered the house .
she leaned down over the recumbent form .
it was a favourite beverage of his , i discovered later .
hullo , joan !
he asked at last .
dont leave the station .
the funeral will probably be arranged for tuesday .
you dont understandor you wont .
shes a real nice girl , and some fellow will fall in love with her right away .
but youre not , are you , darling ?
how should you have known ?
i went to see an old ladymrs .
its two occupants were a tall man with a bald head and a black beard , and a smaller and younger man with a black moustache .
why was he killed , mother ?
that is quite right .
i adored him .
it shall be so , shall it not ?
it was the second time she had said those words .
tuppence and isaac had a pleasant reunion .
but youd got to do things in their proper order .
poirot said : you came for a short visitor a long one ?
now there has been a rearrangement of the kaleidoscope .
its very nice to see such devotion between brother and sister .
rymer had entered the presence of doctor constantine .
im a simple man .
he sprinted noiselessly across the room , removed the chair from under the door handle and with precaution unlocked and unbolted the door .
a friend in cheltenham found me a job with friends of herstwo small boys home in the holidays , and general help in the house .
then he nodded to himself .
pity the girl didnt take it .
he has only just arrived here lately and of course , he might be a sinister strangerpart of a gang or something .
when you finally left the room , did mrs .
my dear child .
i am not at all sure myself that broadmoor wasnt the place for him .
now do the scalpers yell .
but it is so extraordinary that she has disappeared like this .
a bloody concert were going to put on ?
why take it up ?
th iyustlbt : .
look at that moustache of his .
miss wetherby , a long-nosed , acidulated spinster , was the first to spread the intoxicating information .
her own words startled her .
engine going round a curve .
who found her ?
not likely , sir .
black men .
you had no feeling for her ?
george bartlett gaped at him .
you know , the old gardener chap as works here now and then .
show her in at once , cried tommy , thrusting his novel into a convenient drawer .
about tomorrow mr .
coleman had started in to hassanieh in the morning , driving himself in the lorry with the letters in a knapsack .
she was a good waitressquick and obliging .
well , im sorry about that , said tommy , but , well i thought id perhaps just have a look round .
being done ?
catherines she took a place in torquay .
rendell may have sat at home all the evening listening to her wireless or she may notno one can say .
but this is most important .
possibly walter fane thinks that kelvin halliday was the original cause of her turning him down .
disappointing , said poirot .
dead .
but we need not go into this now ; you will be given full instructions when the time comes .
in the hand of a woman like the countess , bill would be as wax .
he divorced her in order to marry you .
he remained in thought for some moments .
wanted to send it to cooks .
ok , sir .
well , its rather a curious story , sir , he informed sir rowland .
i thought of mrs .
he ran the boat neatly alongside a stone quay on the other side .
well , one always likes to suggest an easier possibility .
well , i said , it seemed to me youve been treating yourself to a busmans holiday !
she came to me from the orphanage .
nasty business .
ill keep everything from her that i can , i said .
addressed to my father ?
dar squeezed through first , i followed , and then mary .
clever of you to come to the window and not through the front door .
a possible future prime minister !
im so frightfully hungry , pippa complained , yawning again .
argyles death i gave jacko a lift at the stated time .
more money , replied his companion .
geoffrey raymond .
she met lord roland when he was secretary to the british embassy in catonia and their attachment dates from that time .
oh dear , how difficult it was .
blackmail , said giles bluntly .
whether she will tell you i do not know .
and suddenly a very simple way of testing the solution occurred to him .
lancaster has left , i hear .
just as a matter of form , is there anyone who can corroborate the fact that you were typing in your room betweenerten minutes to eleven and ten minutes to twelve ?
nevertheless , in a moment of peril , she turned to her brother for help , and when things went wrong , they all hung together in a remarkable way .
well , its just this , sir .
that is truesobek diedand yahmose nearly died henet !
well , anyway i thought it might be interesting .
yes , i do , duchess .
and we can repeat it ad lib .
you were quite rightno doubt you were pointed out to him at the royal spa hotel and he pretended to recognize you .
otherwise people will think i actually did wring her neck .
michael falls for these creatures in a waythat sorrel dainton woman nearly got her hooks into himwanted him for keepsbut with michael the show will always come first .
julia smiled lazily .
his experiment with kirsten had been highly satisfactory , but he doubted that he would get any more out of her .
you did not know what you meant to do .
she gave me a little pearl and diamond brooch and she sent ten shillings to each of the children .
bantry followed him .
yes , but theyre not very convincing .
now , suzanne , i said , weve got to make plansand make them quickly .
kameni told me so .
i suppose were not going off our heads , are we ?
they were : why did lord edgware change his mind on the subject of divorce ?
you cant imagine thethe fury of it and the concentrationand yes , sometimes the agony .
youve been disappointed in me , mrs .
la haute mode must grace the occasion .
ive seen to that .
if that was the case it was of course most irregular .
it is a tribute to her personality , i think , that everyone went on calling her isobel loring .
they were family spoons , said mr .
kelsey when they left .
at tel kochek there was more bad luck .
her home was rotterdam .
then he turned to us .
her words left him dumbtongue-tied .
the choice narrows , murmured tommy .
get a chauffeurs liverydark-green ours always are .
i was very happy being with max again .
his eyes , which had been half-closed , opened suddenly .
not now .
sometimesshe feels very much alive .
say another ten thousand years or so .
i must know what you did with that ?
i came here of my own accord .
everything was either too tight everywhere or else hung on one in loose folds .
if i could pin any one down to a definite accusationsurely then i should be vindicated ?
and when you had left her , what did you do ?
last marchjust after easter .
getting yourwhatever you call itresearch done .
im nearly half an hour late for lunch .
youre not doing very well , are you ?
lets get this quite clear , sir .
doctors orders .
miss marple hesitated between her shoulder and her knee , but finally decided upon the knee .
not an opportunist .
the ambush is there .
taking a small case from his pocket he blew a little powder over it .
on awakening , mrs .
oliver from where she was standing uncertainly inside the kitchen , to join him .
his wife shrugged her shoulders impatiently .
and presently , about an hour later , raymond boynton returns and having presumably spoken to his mother , says nothing of anything being amiss .
hell make for plymouth , thats the most likely .
a visitor from over the water and the initial p .
can i go to her ?
and true enough , presently james bentley said : well , whos the other ?
well , thank you , mr mitchelland you , mrs mitchelland i beg of you , my friend , do not let this weigh upon your mind .
looked as though he werent satisfied even if the jury were .
she bent her brows a little , as though to concentrate on some all-absorbing problem .
joyce nodded .
miss marple looked horrified .
her hands were held out in front of herwet , glistening , a queer pinkish greythey reminded her of something .
i have met those ladies .
she waited a minute or two , glancing once more round the familiar kitchen .
percival went on .
he took it up and gave the number .
or drink , said mrs .
i knew that in the nursery .
turned me up for the moment , i must admit .
shes just had twins .
what an extraordinary thing .
the whole happiness of my sons life is at stake .
i looked at nothing .
but to his right some way down the corridor a woman wrapped in a scarlet kimono was retreating from him .
then i said again what id said before .
my holiday ?
bookers new house had been bought by a film star .
when she did speak it was abruptly .
when my husband was killedhe was a cripple , you know .
poirot is an adept at suggesting doubts by the tone of his voice .
i could have sworn there was a note of surprise and relief in her voice .
i suppose our nerves werent very good yet , for we all jumped , and miss johnson got quite pale and said : what was that ?
if miss wade was there by accident , who was the real person ?
if youll allow me to advise you , miss , i should saynot the _num_ / _num_ one .
he held it out to clarissa , but did not let her take it .
it comes really from being self-centred , and i dont mean selfish by that , she added .
the manager bowed and departed .
miss spenser consulted her books .
a scar ran diagonally from the corner of his eye to the jaw , disfiguring what would otherwise have been a handsome though somewhat reckless countenance .
out she comes from no .
ten minutes to go , still , said poirot , consulting his large old-fashioned watch .
it was towards this cottage that he ran .
cried emma .
stop the car , and explain that it fell off the luggage cart .
she held out her hand to each of the men in turn , murmuring a few appreciative words .
siegmund and sieglindeso alikeand the alien hunding .
one old colonel of about sixty came barging into my room and crying , now then , lets have a bit of fun with baby !
but how could you be here at ten oclock and yet telephone to me from london at eleven ?
when they reached handcross manor once more , meredith blake said abruptly : i bought that picture , you know .
i mean , one has to look at things as they are .
i pointed out to her that this new will might be regarded as grossly unfair to her family who were , after all , her own flesh and blood .
not at all what hed been led to expect .
i knew it long before i encountered your mother one morning in an unmistakable state of intoxication .
said tuppence , feeling that to go back beyond the reign of queen victoria seemed a little too far into the past for what she was looking for .
morley made an error , injected an overdose , and then after amberiotis left , he realized what he had done , couldnt face the music and shot himself .
chut , chut !
but that , if i appraise the position correctly , is not so simple .
presently she came out again , closing the door behind her , and paused to speak as she passed him .
come at once , moat house , ebury , yorkshire , great developmentstommy .
so thats it !
a p .
thoughts of edward restrained her .
bryant shook his head slowly .
hugo had justlooked at her .
she wanted to escape to a life where male and female come together to create the next stage of living in this world .
and i say , that on the assumption that he is innocent , we can !
a winks as good as a nodfrom you .
what ive been wondering is , do you think we ought to tell the police ?
its an excellent excuse , said sir henry ; but it wont do .
yet to the sensitive mr .
here , he felt , was someone on whom he could lean .
i met him first when i was on a cruise to the west indies .
poirot waved a royal hand .
fate .
she saw his face grow grave as he looked at it .
you dont know codders , repeated bill .
melchett examined it .
man who cant be bribed to tell lies .
she got bored .
in fact , it wasn ' t an alibi at all .
weston inserted himself gingerly into the cleft .
though mixed bathing was accepted by then , it was still regarded as dubious by the older ladies and more conservative families .
shes much toowell , artificial .
then she gave a cry .
whether the man had entered that way earlier , or whether he had left it so as a blind in case he was disturbed , i do not know .
her dark hair was parted in the middle and drawn back in two shining waves to a knot in the back of the neck .
i racked my brains to remember certain details .
yes dear , but that was because she had left them a lot of money .
its just richard amusing himself as usual .
beside him iris was unusually silent .
and miss grey too !
richard refused to be diverted to archaeological topics and went on firmly : she told me the most extraordinary story .
i never thought you a fool , my dear lady , but may i venture to suggest that you are somewhat foolhardy ?
well , i should guess it was very boring .
she laid down the receiver , hurried across the room , and backed poirot into a breakfast nook .
you are to be careful , monty .
hastings , shall i recount to you a little history ?
hed have to come right up the village street , or creep through someones back yard .
there will be a grand butler and several footmen , and when the moment comes , theyll clear away your plate , whether youve finsihed or not .
and youve been herehow long ?
once we can establish what that connection is , we will be forearmed .
said hester , whats the other kind of murderer ?
he went away and tuppence settled down to her planningwhat she wanted was : a social engagement involving a hat and party shoes .
again i say , the old men !
we havent done soas yet .
look here , beresford , said mr .
she had become very blind indeed with cataract , and she was , of course , too old to be operated on .
his v : sus , 	picio , usly at hitias[rn , d his voice was shrill an , d , harsh , with hey , he said a ' so you re hercule poirot , hey ?
what do you think it can have been , doctor ?
oliver said : this is quite a coincidenceour all meeting here .
i didnt want to meet the others .
two or three girls did but they did not look particularly interesting .
carter shut the book .
and of course i dusted the room .
s room and addressed divisional detective-inspector lejeune in a chatty manner .
we get the money when she diesshe might just as well part with a little beforehand !
evidently it had been in a bad state of repair for some time .
i dont profess to understand these modern ideas .
nasty ?
she moved now like a woman in a happy dream .
i say , what was the end of that message ?
it leaves charlock at four-five and gets here at six-fifteen .
not half as balmy as he looks , mind you .
poisoned with strychnine .
swiftly he replaced the knife , and turning , left the room .
oh , do tell me .
theyre the sister and her husband of the man in the church .
symmington .
i couldnt quite make her out .
at the doorway jane paused and then came back .
brought you secretly into the house and up the stairs .
then we would go up and meet the men at the club-house and have a drink there .
got very few letters and wrote less .
heavy white makeup for lady stubbs with a big coolie hat to shade her face ; a gay peasant scarf , sunburned complexion , and bronze-red curls for the italian girl .
never was a clearer case , short of catching a murderer absolutely red-handed .
the nurse threw away some and miss lawson got rid of all the old lot in the medicine cupboard in the bathroom .
tuppence merely continued to shake her head violently .
it was eleven oclock when they left .
' poirot replied : ' i am wondering about my knowledge of english .
by the way , is there still that nice young inspector at melchester that i remember ?
armed with this galaxy of feminine beauty they proceeded to the bon temps where fresh difficulties and much expense awaited them .
the boy .
he said : ive sometimes wanted to paint a flight of impossibly-coloured australian maccaws alighting on st .
what was i to do about it ?
a great many art experts came and gave their verdicts .
vyse with a groan .
well said father , slightly dazed .
we were to arrive on a certain day .
i know you by name , of course , m .
and whats more i was crazy about her god help me , sometimes i think i still am its hell , i tell youhell .
you are leaving your husband now , you are saying good night to him .
fifteen strange behaviour of frederica poirots inventions about the chief constable were proved not to have been so mendacious after all .
goodness , i do feel queer .
enderby encouraged him to talk .
on the outside of the door is affixed a square card on which is printed in cuneiform beit agatha (agathas house) .
these were described by archie as sand and gravel soup , recalling the skit by stephen leacock on a russian short storyyog took sand and stones and beat it to make a cake .
he halted a little over the end part of his speech , making it somewhat telegraphic in style .
' well , m .
id never have believed it .
the driver of the second taxi said : like to sit inside while youre waiting ?
i pass where i please , said the stranger .
her father beckoned to her and hester went over and sat on the arm of his chair .
i dont believe for a moment she took a real overdose and i think dr .
i must come to the point at once .
it was a kind of luminous haze .
we have a feeling lately that some of the things that have been inventedgerm warfare , for exampleare difficult to explain except through the process of some secret development , thought to be unimportant but it hasnt been unimportant .
sir charles went to the window and looked out .
it was produced .
' perhps he eant to get rid of it - and the shock of the wrong person ieing poisoned paralysed him .
does it distress you very much , mademoiselle , that a crime has been committed on this train ?
youre part of the firm , ruth .
she got up suddenly with a murmured excuse and went into the hotel .
sooner or later , i destroy vermin .
im only sorry ive been of such little use .
but young reeves , the message boy , came from staverley on his bicycle and no car passed him , yet he comes round the corner , finds the smash , and the doctors car pointing the same way he was goingtowards london .
then everyone began to speak at once .
she stood looking at them from the doorway into the womens quarters .
do you know captain jimmy faulkener ?
i bet you couldnt .
no , i dont think hes interested in racing .
fair warning : dumb witness is best read after the mysterious affair at styles ; the murder of roger ackroyd ; the mystery of the blue train ; and death in the cloudssince the identity of the criminal in each is revealed in this novel .
i guess i was just a mite hasty , but ive been feeling bad about this money question .

then , breathing heavily and painfully , he stretched an arm out of bed .
i am not clever like you , monsieur poirot .
really , lynn , i dont know what you mean .
there was a tap at the door and sally entered .
the colour rose in her face .
ill confess it struck me that way at first .
actually , of course , she was set down by the car in the first large town where she at once resumed her own personality .
she was up there in the house waiting for me .
i was in a glow of excitement the following evening .
poirot , poor old chap , is getting on .
anyone who knows you .
poirot , hes explained to you how it was .
certainly , duchess .
a pleasant-spoken young gentleman .
poirot held up a finger .
in the tiny dining room of poirots service flat there seemed nothing else but cerberus in the room .
i read only the other day that theyre very happy in broadmoorits quite like a high-class club .
cooking demands all your creative abilities and complete attention .
had a cousin rather like that .
mcginty had been killed on november _num_ nd .
its a beautiful site , i said defensively , and the house were building is going to be a beautiful house .
part iii growing up i life took on a completely different complexion after my fathers death .
so thats what he calls her and thinks of her as , thought stafford nye to himself .
because his conscience troubled him he could not help behaving with a certain ruthlessness .
the inspector invested the word with its full quota of sinister significance .
nobody , really , said mr .
luke put his hand on bridgets arm .
my wife ?
i think ive got some say in the matter , sylvia , said roger gently .
but that meansthat here in this house rubbish , shouted ipy .
satterthwaite had hardly noticed at the dinner-table .
i never so much as saw them .
near the boulders and things .
who it is ?
superintendent crossfield had a childish reverence for the glamour of the stage .
i was surprised , yes .
naturally , she wanted to know all you could tell her of his last moments .
i had a terrible feeling that the die was cast .
if that girl annie knows , she must be a clairvoyant .
each time it will be upon the occasion of some public function .
my assignment is in the nature of a watching brief .
both men shivered .
he turned to bill .
and that was before the normans came .
now which one , i wonder ?
was that the only reason you planned thisto see whether it could be done unnoticed ?
darling , she said , do you really think yes , i do .
who is he really ?
let me see her .
julia stalked angrily out of the kitchen and at that moment the doorbell rang .
yes , a damned hole !
weve all got to die sometime , said mr .
no , on the whole , id rather you stayed with me .
you think , in fact , that theres someone going up and down wilbraham crescent selecting a victim from every house ?
but you cant at once , cried tuppence .
the heavy tweed coat showed a dark green skirt and sweater underneath .
explanations that the journey ought not to have taken more than eight hours by his calculations were not well received .
really , i told you all i know .
why , he couldnt even speak english properly !
it was a shockthats what it was , a shock !
lady stubbs stood watching her for a moment , then absent-mindedly pulled off a magnolia flower , smelt it and began slowly to walk down the path that led through the trees to the river .
and that reason ?
charmian said , are we mad , or are you ?
more so .
the chair she always sat in .
poirot laid down the receiver quickly .
jealous because she and youwell , i didnt understand beforehow linked together you were .
im much too great an admirer of dear lord mayfields to do anything to cause him the least little bit of worry .
ah , said my mother , yes youve got gipsies around here , havent you ?
youre glad they dont .
luxor , karnak , the beauties of egypt , were to come upon me with wonderful impact about twenty years later .
thought i saw someone slip across the terrace from my study window .
the next time i was in england i even went and saw the landlady of her room , with the results i have told you .
youll get no money out of us , so you can stop coming and whining for it ?
neither nigel nor his accomplice could consider attention being called to the rucksacktheir whole plan of campaign would be ruined .
and theyve been checking up on times and it seems that i took too much time between the lodge and the housetime enough , the implication is , to leave the car , run round the house , go in through the side door , shoot christian and rush out and back to the car again .
im ellies husband , arent i ?
she wore a tweed coat and skirt made rather like a mans .
quin , mr .
we talked a little , and then he went away .
i telephoned beda druce , who came round at once .
david hunter bowed to poirot .
poirot concealed a smile in his moustache .
there didnt seem to be any intimacy , any fun !
poirot said slowly : it is true that i have a thoroughly bourgeois attitude to murder .
i smiled now as i remember my abrupt entry into the drawing room .
personally i shouldnt mind in the least .
and after all , men are men all over the world .
' are you " hot on the trail " as they say in books ?
i dont know why they should , but they do .
he repeats over and over again that he went straight up to his room and never went near his uncle .
i was to tell kelvin that she did not want a divorce .
i look to you to arrange the matter .
sometimes , it was most awkward in the parish .
do you know if he was ever in santiago ?
let me put down these scrolls and these other things and i will come with you , renisenb .
but this queer story of a spectral face and hand was different .
hardly reasons for suicide , but they had to put forward something .
another point , said the inspector .
hubbard should take it into her head to acquire first-hand details of the crime to write to her daughter .
aniseed , it wasor smelt like it .
pierce halt .
henet uttered a shrill cry : more misfortune .
she was sitting in a straight-backed chair , her grey hair becomingly arranged , her legs were crossed and mr .
i wouldnt put it past her to sneak away quietly , instead of being a corpse , and go and have tea .
what her husband , colonel lacey , had actually said was : cant think why you want one of these damned foreigners here cluttering up christmas ?
poirot waved aside the tough school much as he would have waved an intruding fly or mosquito .
at the same time , i studied their faces unobtrusively .
the two policemen watched him .
the faint mockery of her tone made the other uneasy .
gave him an uncomfortable feeling .
i want you to tell the inspector the truth .
get me a whisky peg .
there was something strangely likeable about the young man .
what you needed there was the larder and the wood shed and the pantry that had been there originally .
that sort of thing does so amuse them .
i cant make you out , moosior .
the rest of us were just dazzled .
you thought him attractive ?
i know , my dear , that isnt what you expected when i began this story .
she had often been alone in the house beforebut she had never before been so conscious of being alone in it .
you must tell me more about yourself .
amos , she shouted , amos .
poor gwenda was thoroughly upset , and i must say id have been rather worried myself to think that gwenda was clairvoyant or psychic or something .
can do , said dashwood cheerfully .
the girl sorted them out obediently , packed them up and made out the bill .
shes to understudy cora .
is that where its kept ?
also have made friends with three pleasant gigglers , christian names , pamela , lois and mary , surnames unknown , but of aristocratic lineage .
its the only clue ive got .
romantic remembrance ?
she would not dare attempt anything rash .
there are too many things it might be nowadays , said dr .
itll be good publicity apart from the pay .
superintendent nash unobtrusively left the room .
or , at leastthere i was againdreaming !
retribution was swift .
then i couldnt remember how long ago it was when i left home .
i really think we might get her off at once .
the more people who talked to him , and the more they said , the better .
you understand , dont you , that the whole thing may be bluffnothing but bluff ?
freda clay admitted an error , saying that her aunts sufferings were so bad that she could not stand it and gave her more morphia to ease the pain .
would have taken a fancy to and removed the portrait of a middle-aged lady .
yes , much younger than mrs .
he covered his confusion by saying quickly : naturallyi had intended thattell esa i shall come .
the police of this country hurry across the channel , and no one bothers to go into the details of the first attack .
anything i can do , burbled mr .
i tell you , i know a good deal .
mais oui , you did !
clergymens daughters and sisters and wives .
he held unusually strong views on the subject of dope .
i frightened you , didnt i , jerry ?
rings for conductor .
did the deceased say anything i ought to know ?
only since the funeral , sir .
these were futilities that he was uttering , and the girl by his side was not listening .
oh , thats quite all right , said miss marple immediately , because , you see , i wasnt really quite ready then to put all my cards on the table .
he wont bite you , said tuppence .
in a case of this kind , you have got to make up your mind who is lying .
he was just returning to go down again when a sound caught his ears ; he then saw the little man halfway down the spiral staircase that led to the bedroom above .
but i dont believe it is christopher .
' i said , rather crestfallen .
i grasped at this , since i was not feeling in the mood for work this morning , and it made a splendid excuse for postponing it .
that note has worried me all along .
she is simply awful .
one gets infected , it is true , by the style of a work that one has been reading .
most of her fortune , as i have told you , had gone into trusts .
says next to nothing .
and did you see anyoneanyone at all , when you looked down the deck ?
but you cant say for sure that he did .
harlequin and columbine dance round him .
he knew the tang of it , the taste of it , the way it went .
and leconbury is not an impoverished peer by any means .
i came back from london a couple of days afterwards .
he had a long face like a horse , he was pale and looked rather supercilious .
positively triumphant ?
what evidence of identification was there at the inquest ?
she got very wet and found no trace of the strange woman .
i think , on the journey to petra , mr jefferson copes eyes were being opened .
i wound a scarf round my head and stole to the door .
wonder how long hes been here , and what hes doing staying at the cricketers ?
i wont stand it .
she said : hes very nice-looking , isnt he ?
miss tripp acknowledged the introductions and began to fuss a little .
alas that he did not smoke the cigarette and leave the ash , and then step in it with a shoe that has nails of a curious pattern .
i wont say take care of yourself , because i gather that the whole point is that you should do just the opposite .
i had been talking to simmons about the pillowcasesand i remember dimly crossing over to the fireplaceand thinking we must get a new pokerthe curate , not the rector inspector grange stared .
well , he said , lets get it clear .
it was then that i decided i must have a literary agent .
you cannot go home , madame , said poirot sternly , until you have heard what i have to say .
i guess you havent tumbled to the little idea , mr .
a good strong head is an asset to any human being , i said .
and the very next morning he had walked into that palace of plate glass , with its lordly inmates in their glory of gleaming enamel and shimmering metal , and with an insouciance that surprised himself , he bought the car .
to george , the jewellery hes given me , and the little enamel casket we bought together when we were engaged .
down below she heard shouts and blows .
im the more in favour of the lady being the killer because i cant find anyone else , he said , as he put the book away .
had an operation , she had .
but i got no satisfactory answer .
all right ?
but i am fairly certain that he will turn up .
you and she didnt have a quarrel ?
seeing himself as the wronged hero in a romantic story .
no , i dont think you are .
in some way , unknown to myself , i was a menace , a danger !
no , i tell you it wasnt me .
oh , thatno , i dont think so .
quentinjust going into a little cottage .
miss hargreaves came to see me yesterday , and asked me to come down here .
it was not easy .
but to get definite evidence will not be easy .
it is very good what you have done there .
oh , hell , phillipa , why are you like you are ?
/ ?
' i asked you to come here - ' explained poirot .
rosamund caught her breath .
you mean thatthat i would have found out something about mary jordan .
that is just what worries me .
thats the spirit , said frankie .
oh yes , its a long time ago , but i remember it all .
because there must be blackbirds !
in fact i only contemplated one thinga happy marriage .
old ladies are like that , sir .
lets go there .
well , welli warned you .
now well search the rest of the house , he announced , going to the hall door .
busy bee had hinted delicately that it was to be an abode for royalty ?
yes , the lake japp gave him a quick glance .
from the train journey i brought back carved wooden animals , held up at various stations by little native boys , asking three-pence or sixpence for them .
i think there is something , i dont know if hidden is the right word , theres something here .
i held them under my nose .
i have a devout belief in providencea divinity that shapes our ends , as shakespeares beautiful line runs .
tuppence stared at her in surprise and then down at the book , which was a coloured version of little jack horner .
you are very brave , said ellie .
when she finally removed the tea tray and shut the door behind her , miss marple drew a deep breath .
this ramp has got to stop .
wood and a man in disguise say we at once .
farraday are anxious to give you all the help they can in the hope that the matter may be cleared up speedily and public interest in it die down .
but i answered myself : not necessarily .
the chambermaid came into the room .
ah , japp !
ten to one , i thought to myself , its drugs .
baths and some really comfortable chairsthats all i can think of .
we were taken to the comedie francaise and saw the classic dramas and several modern plays as well .
blatt went on .
poor little thing , she was only about three years old .
it drew up at last over a gravel driveway and came to a stop before the porch .
barnes , voicing the universal sentiment of her class .
sir gervase was really just talking to himself .
lady clarke , you mustnt say that .
thats what my secretary , miss ross , said this morning .
suddenly helen raised her hands to her face .
i cant help being like that , said hester .
he spoke lightly of a fishing expedition he had made lately .
she was overdressed and wore too much jewellery .
and i say you dont know it .
now she would have to get on with the sleeves .
and then i began thinking of miss springer and whetherwhether her murder would affect the parents , and whether perhaps they wouldnt send their girls back here next term .
has he stuck to it with you ?
you do not hang people any longer in this country .
stafford nye went on .
a puny childno stamina .
go and get yourself a good hot cup of tea in the restaurant room .
i hear that he never leaves home .
solve the cryptogram and the treasure is oursor rather monicas .
and they have found nothing else ?
poirot said : i will join you immediately .
shes led a blameless life , too , said rhoda .
de rushbridger , but neither of them could add any information to that already given .
but there was nothing .
so now there was no help for it .
its quite simple ; anyone could do it .
you spoke of tragedy .
you didnt see the other one there ?
he made a slighting reference to her brains .
lived here , in this house i mean .
how did one talk of events in europe nowadays ?
it was a spectacular stretch of countrypeaceful , romantic , and impregnated with the past .
a couple of young men who were mixed up in the outfit somewhere or other and the capable woman , miss bellever , whod phoned him and met him on arrival .
there were some young adolescents there ?
at intervals , gerald wade said to pongo : well-played , partner , jolly well-played .
somebody found out where she was .
asked sylvia suddenly .
philip lombard shook his head .
croft with a reference to australia and philip buckley whom they know once visited the country .
her tone expressed disappointment .
mind you , im not knowing all about this myself .
she moved a chair politely towards poirot .
there was a chance of partial recovery : good aircontinual soaking in hot bathsa quiet life .
oh dear , said tommy .
it would be throwing the money away .
something of the weary manner returned .
yes , mountains were much , much higher than that .
carrie louise suddenly miss marple realised that it was she alone , except for the absent ruth , who used that name .
i thought i must be imagining things .
miss marple transferred her gaze from her knitting to chief detective-inspector davy .
but old merdell did .
marshall went this morning to pixy cove to meet someone .
whats somerset house ?
' ' that ' s right .
gladys gave a little shriek .
i expect you come up to do shopping occasionally .
now , in all this , it seems certain that queen varaga still kept in with her confederate , king victor .
and then you thought you would get more money by coming to london , i suppose ?
and you will really help ?
turning to starkwedder , she said , this is angell .
ive realized , you know , that if my mother didnt do it , then one of these five people must have done it .
lansquenets family , and of course ive never , never had anything to do with a murder before .
she has met someone on the boat .
unkerton sat heavily in a chair , staring with protruding eyes at the opposite wall .
we were at melbourne for a short time , and took various trips from there .
the police check up on refugees , dont they ?
ive blown off steam now .
croft said will forms were very dangerous .
young carl reiter .
(accepting telephone call time as correct .
wed better see , i think , what he has to say about it .
folliat was how shall i say playing the hostess .
and theyve always lived at home ?
are not four escapes from death enough for her ?
and then i thought of anyone else who has ivory teeth , and i thought about walruses andoh , other things like that .
poirot said slowly : it is not easy to know what captain marshall feels or thinks .
but i always thought she was a nasty type of womanman-mad , you know .
what sort of problem is it ?
thank you , richards .
landor , you mean ?
it took on a sudden ecstatic quality .
my friendsi have come over here to investigate matters .
voil ce qui est curieux , murmured poirot .
his natives were a trustworthy lot and they came back with a good circumstantial tale and a few last words scrawled in underhays writing saying theyd done all they could for him , and he was afraid he was pegging out , and praising up his headman .
ah , its not for me to be saying that , said nurse obrien , betraying , however , every symptom of being about to do so .
excellent , said mrs .
a damn fool of a girl , thats what i was , said lady sedgwick .
she didyou maynt be aware of the factbut she did her very utmost .
he left the whole caboodle to sophia , i said .
i know , i said , that you actually retired years ago cest vrai .
battle stepped across to her and gently took the brown paper parcel which she was still clutching mechanically .
theyre all right .
suzanne and colonel race were standing on the rear observation platform .
asked sheila , sharply , her voice rising .
got a very good job and they think a lot of him .
and he laid a hand on the smooth golden head .
now can i speak to mr .
poirot said slowly : there was a woman at the stag that night .
janeyou look all excited .
he didnt dance , or care much for going out .
i explained that i had prevented mr .
very quiet , though .
yes , i know , but thats because people never really answer what you say , they answer what they think you mean .
did you hear mr leverson come in ?
only a match , said anthony .
the mystery of the mill house , he said .
a dip in the lake and a hearty breakfast will be far more to the point .
i shook my head blankly .
in his desk ?
in his young days kelvin was a professional diver .
there are possibilities there .
nowabout money yes , miss tuppence .
joanna farley turned towards the door .
either this extraordinary story is trueor else or else what ?
poirot made a gesture , and oliver manders came back into the room .
mums asked her to come and stay with us , aunt frances asked her there .
the odds were in reality greater than that .
i think molly was devoted to her sister dolly , but she didnt talk about her very much .
hope and scepticism fought for mastery .
i dont know what made him come back to england after his brother died .
his servants would know , surely , i objected .
said jane olivera blankly .
meaning by that , m .
id have seen her do that , said leo stein quietly .
but miss arundell was a sharp-witted old lady .
it works that way sometimes .
he said : i only build houses for people i want to build for .
the rock-like quality of the superintendent showed out well .
butbut well , frankly , i dont like doing it .
no , she was before my time a bit , i think .
did she admit anyone (j .
we had a bad dinner at the georgepoirot groaning a good deal , especially over the soup .
as soon as we were outside i made an excuse and we returned , kemp slightly ahead .
they had a yacht and went places , i think .
both mr petherick and mr rhodes were staring at me so that i felt quite embarrassed .
her symptoms appeared to pn , .
why are you so excited ?
very kind of you , my dear , to come along to see an old woman .
the servants said shed gone out for a walk .
no punch of any kind .
with every pleasure steamer on the helm looking on ?
i wanted to ask you a few things , mutton chop .
but it might just as easily be someone going out .
i was first his assistant in the laboratory , and afterwards his secretary .
there were one or two leading journalists who had enormous influence and used it unwisely .
poirot said : then he must have gone out soon after me ?
coming from ?
poirot paused .
the colour had not been there a minute before .
good morning , she remarked cheerfully .
and then , when that boy came out with his story of having seen a woman with that necklace onwell , i was afraid .
you think its as widespread as all that , sir ?
dont ee remember ?
he rose and greeted frederica with all his customary gallic politeness .
in a few minutes more victoria had passed its entrance and had come to a more squalid part .
i flung myself down in the chair with a gesture of despair .
we were friends of his mothers .
the mixture as before .
about a seven or eight mile walk there and back .
it is all arranged , then ?
on the other hand her manner that first evening puzzled me .
evans lives just round the corner here in fore street with his wife , and comes in daily to do for his master .
but he felt justifiably annoyed .
for mourning .
four great gates has the city of damascus .
v have you courage , mademoiselle ?
of course , joe never could stand jackie .
his manner was perfectly natural .
that would make her an accessory before the fact , starkwedder remarked .
his cold glance went from van heidem to the director and there was implacable command in it .
theyre not supposed to be known much .
one minute he wasnt there and the next minute he was !
some child who didnt like to do her sewing , i expect , said tommy .
blabbed about his employers affairs .
faulkener , before we look at the contents of this letter .
this dr .
yesterday afternoon i had a little tea party quite an informal affair , some half a dozen people or so .
it was fate , said lady chevenix-gore .
that gives us something to go upon , said sir charles .
ill make you love me .
he paused and went on : for the last three years there have been certain jewel robberies that have been worrying scotland yard a good deal .
i had expected a ringing proclamation of his innocence when poirot challenged him .
but what can you expect ?
do you not mind at all ?
my nameermy names smith .
it was anne who went with him to the gate .
and reiterating fervent thanks , he left her .
the others were busy with the gramophone .
are you going away ?
i told him so plainly .
at least , anyway , hes buried there in the churchyard .
i will tell you , mon ami .
he knew something about who killed mary jordan .
planted !
and the colonel ?
that ties up with the conversation i had about him with dr .
i believe youre jealous , polly .
thought the inspector inelegantly .
she said , well , really , richard , after all these years !
i had no ambition to be a concert singer , which was not an easy thing to do anyway .
the train was due to depart in five minutes .
oh , frightfully .
you know , you could read history or something serious , but novels were only pleasurable and so to be read in the afternoon .
it seems very melodramatic if one says a secret enemy , said miss marple .
they said they would probably arrive tomorrow .
it is perhaps a fault with us detectives .
to begin with , there was a scene between the two men gold and chantry .
he might , of course , have cabled instructions to some lieutenant of his in johannesburg , who could have joined the rhodesian train at mafeking , but his instructions would have had to be particularly definite to allow of that note being written .
carlile mumured : if youll excuse me , lord mayfieldcertain memoranda and other work to get through .
lucy finished washing up and came out into the hall to find harold crackenthorpe waiting for her .
youve got three-quarters of an hour if my watch is rightthough it isnt usually .
quimper grinned .
gina !
very unwisely george laughed .
there was a strugglea struggle heard plainly in the room underneath ; and , whats more , the old gentleman called out for help .
he waited for her to take the initiative .
but that was the only shadow of doubt .
davis ?
lyon occupied the front page .
i can see him , all in black , calling for orders for the funeral .
whose name she cannot remember !
sir george had met him on arrival , had taken him down to the boathouse and had now returned with him to the house .
jack arrived home that evening in a perfect fever of curiosity .
we thought about it , and thought about it .
' 	stillingtleet looked at him curiously .
he went out and shut the door behind him .
as regards his surroundings , these may have been taken to mean his companionshis partner mr .
he was silent for a moment , and susan asked sharply , what do you mean ?
it took about three-quarters of an hour to walk home , along , it must be admitted , fairly lonely roads .
sir oswald complied , his face black as thunder .
ah-ha !
caroline amory and her niece barbara occupied the settee .
if thats the case , and theres such a thing as graft in this country , ill buy her off .
patricia gets on well with everybody , i should say , without being particularly popular or anything like that .
that was on the evening of the _num_ th .
superintendent battle waved him aside with something less than his usual respect .
leversons room the morning after the crime .
it seems most improbable .
anyone may have had a bath .
the ball went round at right angles .
i suppose there are some things one cant do .
they chase those wretched cats of mrs .
no , no , dear , protested miss waynflete .
in any case i suppose there was just the house and not much money ?
its been in the family so long .
good of you to look me up , sir , he said .
oh yes , sir , a very nice gentleman .
there were the usual jeersand smiles .
id like to tear the clothes off her back and stamp on her lovely , arrogant , self-confident face .
dad would skin me alive , he would , for sure , said edna .
two deaths on this island since we arrived !
and now , messieurs , he said dramatically , the final coup !
he came forward with great empressement , and shook the lady warmly by the hand .
uttering a barely audible sigh , she pressed her brow to the cool glass of the window , and stood lost in thought .
who comes into an enormous fortune if mother dies ?
my aunt died recently , and her few possessions have come into our keeping .
its in connection with the recent events at yewtree lodge .
sir malcolm was a young man , mr .
and her smile said many things .
the man in the shabby clothes stared at tommy searchingly .
battle sat quite still , blinking now and then , with no expression whatsoever on his square placid face .
' ' it was the attache-case all right !
im glad youre here , said hester unexpectedly .
her eyes fell before the superintendents steady gaze .
he has always been slightly lame and was unable to take part in games at school .
i hesitated and then i blurted out the words that came to my lips .
oh , no , anthony .
terry clambered down and went unsteadily to a corner .
rydesdale shook his head .
his direction , too , was erratic .
he liked women to be women .
please forgive me , but are you engaged to anyone else ?
and you let him go , said herr spiess .
all left behind .
the latter was , perhaps , the stronger passion of the two .
why should any one see him ?
he apologized for the delay in answering the bell , but explained that he had all the cabins to attend to .
ii think so .
he spoke as head gardeners should speakmournfully , but with dignitylike an emperor at a funeral .
bateman on at clock golf .
she set out mechanically to join kait and the children where they were clustered by the little pavilion , but found that her footsteps lagged and then ceased as if of their own volition .
i can read .
i meanall i could think of was my having shot richard .
its frightfully hot in here , linnet said .
that point has not been overlooked .
you will hear from me , you know .
but its very embarrassing for alfred and myself .
you know , novel reading was not encouraged .
caught in the act , and somewhat flurried , he hastily shuts and locks his desk .
but her well-meant banter only seemed to annoy her son anew .
she would know the risk she ran of a message being intercepted by poirot , thus setting him on her track once more .
a sad world .
tuppence was rather surprised at tommys nonreturn .
welman took the stuff herself .
im not at all sure its the right thing for her .
i mean if i write things , i get them perfectly clear , but if i talk , it always sounds the most frightful muddle ; and thats why i never discuss my plots with anyone .
with an oath elliot sprang forward .
i thought it might be a new scheme of dots , said tommy .
no , no , too much bother to get hold of them so late in the day .
after all , weve had onemurder here this afternoon .
she looks so different , i replied rather feebly .
farrar observed sarcastically .
sti !
father lavigny was just going towards the archway and mr .
yes , just one thing .
gardener was wrestling with a jig-saw .
he was lying down and he didnt want his breakfast .
also a nun , or nuns , called here the day before mr .
i do like gratitude , said tuppence .
its wry , its got its tongue planted firmly in its cheek and it subverts the whole genre it appears to be part of , not least because as well as all of this , it also delivers cleverly dovetailed plotting with a typical christie flourish at the end .
he had done so successfully on former occasions .
so you are asking something ?
i want her .
there was moonlight , and the snow that had fallen two days ago was still unmelted .
oh , very simply .
because the seven dials mystery isnt a thriller .
but it is the general opinion that such an action must not be contrary to the will of the person in the waking state .
that amiable youth , jimmy thesiger , came racing down the big staircase at chimneys two steps at a time .
she laughed and said read your bible .
willett poured out .
simon looked at him with momentary surprise .
we always went this way in the old days , meredith explained .
i will remember .
just blowing off steam , you know .
because the count de la rochefour has left the ritz ?
depends what the walls like .
nervous , eh ?
i dont want to get in no trouble , she said .
the letters were addressed to captain oneill at his rooms in paris , and their principal purpose may have light shed upon it by a curious fact which came to light later .
i said nothing .
an idea stirred nebulously in his brain .
he was convinced that she was thinking of some particular person , and although lord whitfield was in some respects exceedingly childish , he did not believe she was thinking of him .
but theres no gainsaying that helenwell , that she never had a stable character .
he did not disguise to himself the reason for the change .
in half an hour the telephone rang once more .
in fact , more money than brains ?
water rising in a cellar , poison gas , et cetera .
id been going , you see , to have it out with her .
mcginty was killedwhen ?
gregory because he had that queer morbid streak which discounts and invites , almost craves , punishment .
she went to canada six months ago .
poirot , i do wish you all success .
poirots voice held a sudden , tentative note .
i was devoted her voice rose .
writing has that effect , i find .
supposing she kept a picture of herself and supposing that mrs .
the murmurs were not loud enough to reach his ears , but he was none the less sensitive to them .
but that would not be enough .
yes , dreadful nightmares i used to have , miss amory was saying .
spence looked bewildered .
no , she died some years ago .
was possibly added by a different handthe murderers .
we will make a point of asking him tomorrow morning , said miss marple .
instead sophia talked affectionately of the dead woman , of things they had done , and games they had played as children with nannieand tales that the old woman used to tell them about roger and their father and the other brothers and sisters .
again those shrewd old eyes searched his face .
not for the reason youve probably been thinking .
we may suspect that mrs .
the look on lauras face was one of an incomprehension verging on desperation .
david drew his hand across his eyes .
really , sophia , you seemi dont know whats come over you .
seventeen i dinner was a reasonably cheerful meal .
and of course i knew that by the time i got to london they wouldnt want itthey would have had to use a curtain ring or something .
and you and mr .
i was so sure , and that , i think , was what blinded me .
as he emerged , boris remarked , glancing up at the clock : you are early .
maria asked .
and now her voice was sharp and almost hostile .
with an amiable little bowhe was always amiablehe left the room and wandered out into the big square hall of mon repos .
and its my opinion it does an elderly person good to have a young face about .
and yet it is so simple .
he stops , he turns .
then he said : i perceive now why you desired my presence .
the rank and file of the clergy certainly couldnt , poor devils .
come now , miss marplethe curious coincidence of the charwoman or the mystery of the mothers meeting .
i think , said poirot , that your assumptions are a little overdramatic .
i myself was not aware of what had happened until my valet informed me of the mistake , and that mr .
circumstances have rendered it necessary , in my opinion , that a straightforward account of them should be given to the public .
put him in a hospital train , i remember , arm in a sling , badly woundedhe got an idea in his head he didnt want to go to hospital .
you can hardly blame them in this instance , i said .
the letters are an interesting point , he said .
poirot and signor richetti at last found him .
durrant ?
rowley cloade and miss marchmont .
but it wasnt miss henderson .
the inspector nodded .
half of gwenda attended to making the requisite noises of condolence , sympathy and understanding .
there are things i want to know , said calgary .
i said , after waiting a minute or two .
nicoletis gave her a flickering look from her dark eyes and then looked away again .
i started quite early , you know .
young man , im telling you .
she reddened angrily .
at the time of her death was there anything whatever to worry her or make her unhappy about the future ?
for something , ive always believed , that she did .
people must havemust have confidence in you !
ah , yes , i am promising myself that pleasure .
she looked at him angrily and proudlythen the anger melted .
he said : where the devil can he be ?
blue , and a floppy sort of hat .
i require a house about this distance from london , said poirot .
we all went to church , and listened respectfully to mr .
i shouldnt have spoken to you as i did .
iii i want to talk to you seriously , kendal , about your wife .
cloade described .
if i were they , i should accept such an alibi with reservewith great reserve .
you just notice how the waiters fly about for him .
if one has an opportunity to observe human nature , time is never wasted , said poirot quietly .
pippa immediately got to her feet .
ive got one of these gardening mothers .
and you , dr gerard ?
the waiter started slightly , but pretended to be doing something with the saltcellar .
not very far from much benham and only twelve miles from the coast at loomouth .
im all out for revenge on the murderer .
then he asked a question .
babbington had risen to his feet and was swaying to and fro .
also large quantities of dressmaking patterns and knitting patterns and which branched off into a counter for art needlework .
poirot whom i believe she had met this morning .
i got out of bed , dressed , walked down to the hospital , went infortunately i did not have to go through the ward , since the staircase to the dispensary was outside itwent up , surveyed the ointments i had prepared , opened the lids , and sniffed cautiously .
rogers came nearer .
its quite all right , my boy .
ill be dangerous when i get hold of him !
frankly , said david , i dont understand it at all .
you have read the morning papers , i presume , miss lemon ?
theyve often got a way with them , but you never know , do you ?
which explains why we are walking along this exceedingly hot street on an exceedingly hot morning .
im innocenti assure you , im innocent .
but she had a grand spirit .
i can assure you that that decision will please everyone .
do you mind if i go upstairs and have a wash ?
but some indefinable uneasiness drove his feet on faster .
tall , soldierly , with quiet reflective eyes and a straightforward unassuming manner .
the rate of progress of a car , the likely distance where it would refuel , possible villages where travellers might have stayed the night .
it must have been midnight or after when i got home .
it moves me not .
what ridiculous questions you do ask !
tony said rather inconsequentially : imwellyou seeim rather fond of deborah .
these wretched so called ladies are the ones who get it taken out of them nowadays .
after all , theres a certain amount of evidence to support it .
partners in crime featured in it my two young sleuths , tommy and tuppence , who had been the principal characters in my second book , the secret adversary .
she had already been intrigued by the rather startling differences between the three brothers .
it was all he did know of the man he was about to visit .
he listened to all mrs .
one year , two years and it is all finished , the grand passion !
something that had caused her to have been negligent to a guest to whom she was talking .
but there was a time before that , further back .
why do you always worry ?
yet for her there was , or so i suspected , a second spring .
debarred from becoming his mistress by the simple honourable nature of the man , jeanne beroldy had conceived the monstrous project of ridding herself of her elderly , undistinguished husband and becoming the wife of the rich american .
i dont use it now , said mrs .
the doctor hesitated .
the lady in question was found dead in her compartment this morning .
i took a sudden resolution .
it was quiet and remorseless .
the house was quiet and apparently empty .
definitivement , he said .
sheer vindictiveness , perhaps .
i wouldnt have believed it possibleeven for you , lady eileen .
what has bothered me , continued battle , was wondering what had become of m .
i want some paste for sandwiches , please .
there was no self-consciousness in her attitude to life .
lying on his back , smiling agreeably , roger seemed to take a positive pleasure in enlightening them .
and sometimes , of course , they were , but not always .
josie , who was shrewd , practical , hard as nails , and all out for money .
the nurse says she left her case in the hall and found a tube of morphine missing in the morning .
her darkened eyelashes quivered .
it looks as though it would be the other waysudden violence , a fit of passion or jealousybut im beginning to think that thats not so .
but i quite appreciate the fact that we are all strangers to one another and that , in those circumstances , nobody can be exonerated without the fullest proof .
great thing to be fit .
he winked at me .
forward to mathilde .
that is success !
a nasty business , said spence .
i wasnt thinking of cora .
thatll do , i said , and put a dollop of it into megans cup .
vandemeyer that the girl had been with her on the lusitania when that ill-fated ship was sunk , and had suffered a severe shock in consequence .
say the case was mishandled by depleach .
admiral blunt , colonel munro , colonel pikeaway and henry horsham remained to make their comments with more freedom of speech than they would have permitted themselves if the vips had remained .
it all seemed like a silly dream .
abernethies illness .
during all this , mary had been extracting eyes from potatoes with such energy that they had been flying round the kitchen like hailstones .
ive got one bit of news for you , clement .
then i remembered something , and taking the little brownish crystal i had found in the wood from my pocket , i held it out to him and asked him what it was .
we found it crushed to splinters on the path up to the house .
she was a tough hefty young woman and had no doubts of her own ability to cope with anything she might find .
hes an immensely busy man .
i must just lie still .
it is a great part , madame .
he waited for poirot to explain himself .
i suppose , said mother , wed better have a look on top of some of the other pieces of furniture .
and yetthere was quite a lot of money , wasnt there ?
blunts face registered comprehension .
what about the other guests , the edens and the campbells ?
and i will tell you this , if the man suffering from a delusion happened to hold his tongue about it , in all probability we should never be able to distinguish him from a normal individual .
yes , indeed , my dear , i have been so terribly upset that this should happen to you when you have been so kind .
nothing between her and the doctor , i shouldnt think .
he said to me , there are other ways of giving a woman her freedom .
he was with me when we found the body .
the changes theyve made here !
underhays probably safely buried in africa as weve always thought he was .
you know what a ravenous appetite pippa always has .
thats necessary .
thats his value , of course .
then emma stopped .
elsa stared for a minute .
christine ?
i turned to poirot .
there was no one who could say whether or not she had gone aside into mrs .
i have been out all day .
i expect someone overheard something , though , dont you ?
theyve all got it , more or less , but marina gregg has got it more than most people .
i never know what i owe .
supposing somebody goes and shoves .
quite , said the inspector .
it is my business to know things .
i suppose , then , id better see him , said colonel pikeaway without any marked relish .
but men didnt take much notice of her and other girls rather made use of her .
and theres good authentic authority for it .
the girl started .
this was the personal sitting room of the mistress of the house and the mistress of the house was standing against the mantelpiece as poirot was announced and shown in .
for me , he added frankly , i would keep racehorses and women , and all the world has to offer .
vii poirot arrived home to be informed by george that a lady was waiting to see him .
yesyes , thats much more what i mean .
im not one of those doctors who want to endow whacking great research establishments and all that .
its a month since its been done .
the driver let in the clutch and they started off .
for the moment , nothing , except that i want you to come down to chimneys tonight .
suddenly the door burst open and the commissary rushed in .
no light repartee , have you , old bean ?
his eyes challenged us .
the telephone bell rang .
read the story of my life by jefferys , for descriptions and a feeling for nature .
van aldin did not answer , but he was not satisfied .
he would not use his own ink .
when you met her afterwards and you learnt that i had been present at the interview you hurried things on .
i thank you , monsieur , he said .
let me seethat was march , no , februarythe end of february .
i doubt if you will here , said bridget dryly .
ive hung out as long as i could .
marinas response was this time not so automatic .
asked superintendent huish , but before calgary could speak the telephone rang on huishs desk and the superintendent picked it up .
thats a beautiful head , observed mr .
he must feel a bit top heavy when he walks about .
oh , well , youre all very superior about it .
but i dont think you ought to allow yourself to be affected by it , kenny .
but something held him back .
the investigation of crime is not new to me , said mr .
no motive for killing the girl , said bland ; but i do think , you know , that she might have a motive for killing lady stubbs .
yes , she was overdrawn .
careful of what ?
he said to me yesterday : thank heaven , theres one sane person in the world .
i am quite sure he had no idea of what you meant .
id like another woman hereto support me .
actually i got a reputation for being rather cool under fire .
complicated and yet simple .
am i the first person you haveertried this test on ?
no , said mrs lacey , thats just what i felt about it .
as for me , i lived already with some hundreds of fhrers , of napoleons , of julius caesars .
lansquenets relations on the day that she was killed .
just for a moment mrs .
snoo !
ill bring you along a cup , too !
he tossed it across to me .
in fact i dont know what the st .
then the way he spoke about itit didnt ring true .
that she shot lombard , took the revolver back to the house , toppled the marble block on to blore and thenhanged herself .
you dont waste much time , do you ?
in case it tasted rather nasty i thought i would open a bottle of those raspberries i put up last summer .
calling it a holiday might be all part of the game .
i am beginning to think that the person who wrote those letters deliberately used your name .
for a moment i hesitatedthen the terrible alternative rose like a nightmare before my eyes .
she followed me and stood looking at me .
i dont feel like going abroad .
one of the more pleasing madonnas , dermot craddock thought .
it wasnt just a pretty woman who wanted to keep me out in the garden with her .
thesiger took him down to the car and helped him in .
you he-man .
i dont mean it was ever like greta .
as for coming tonightshe laughedwell , when i want a thing , i simply cant wait .
quite capable as far as she goes , and cooks not at all badly .
inquest tomorrow morning .
though , of course , i was too polite to say so .
she will also send for me a certain overseas cable .
charles knew one of the bitterest moments of his career .
it might surprise people .
simon repeated doggedly , unmoved by poirots lighter note , jackies straight !
barbara amory , with hastings in tow , returned from the garden through the french windows , and barbara moved to share the settee with carelli while hastings went to stand by poirots side .
what a very remarkable case !
the scene of the drama that was being enacted inside was evidently just to the left , out of his line of vision .
i think it would be better to make him wait for ita good long apprenticeship .
ellen was mollified .
each man seemed eyeing his neighbour doubtfully .
you are renisenb who wants to think for herself , who wonders about other people .
telling me hes my nephew indeed !
i said reproachfully , and proceeding to follow the example of the devil in quoting scripture for his own ends i added : she looketh to the ways of her household .
a car came for her this morningoh , about half past eleven i should think , and she drove off .
i fear we shall have to find out what he had eaten or drunk in his last hours .
i ran across her by chance .
trying to cure him of thinking hes god almighty .
i know very well what concussion does to people .
idiotic story .
it is a pity that the photograph you sent me is so difficult for anyone to recognize .
actually , its the box that held the sedative tablets prescribed for emma .
the times : splendid .
im not too flush just now , as a matter of fact .
to have been one of the guests at a party where murder is committed is not a pleasant experience .
suddenly , next door , the wireless went on in the library .
for a moment japp looked taken aback .
see here , you want to know , do you not , who it was killed lord edgware , who it was killed miss adams , who it was killed donald ross ?
you should have warned me .
tommy winked at tuppence to indicate that she was to keep monica with her , and he himself stepped across to where the gardener was working .
yesspeaking , henry announced .
what was the next thing ?
nemesis is long delayed sometimes , but it comes in the end .
he paused and then said , has elinor carlisle any enemies ?
very likelyit didnt matternothing mattered , but gerald .
on the leftno , on the right .
i cant think why i wanted to read that , but i did .
for a moment alix stayed as though petrified , then she crept on tiptoe to the window , looking out from behind the shelter of the curtain .
but it isnt mad , tommy .
a house , built with grace and a certain amount of beauty , lived in once , cherished .
well , said adam , as poirot went out .
did she take her young man with her ?
yes , thats true , agreed mr .
down on your knees , felicie .
but i dont think hed hide in an area , and wait cold-bloodedly to shoot her .
, , the broad staircase .
no one hated mary gerrardexcept elinor carlisle .
he was not sympathetic .
you may have met him already .
i was returning to town tomorrow .
poirot in a friendly , chatty way .
to think that you and i were discussing dots and puzzling over that advertisementall as lighthearted as anything .
the clever devil !
a madman is a very dangerous thing .
please dont let me hamper you in any way .
look after her , hastings , will you ?
please dont think i shall mind anything you say .
and had he determined that not more than one set of clues should fall into the thiefs possession ?
if that doesnt beat the band !
and extremely comfortable .
these terms i expect you already know .
its all over now , my dear .
whereve you been now ?
sir james smiled a little .
before she died .
the servants went to bed at half-past ten and lorrimer , after putting the drinks in the hall , went to bed at a quarter to eleven .
asked me how i was off for moneyand sent me a regular allowance every week .
he said , i dont know whats come over you , molly .
just accepts things at their face value .
one is not incommoded by too much air .
what about the airport bag ?
not all the time .
she stared at him open-mouthed , and he nodded sapiently .
its a miracle she hasnt heard you , said jimmy .
and then , quite incredibly , i heard a bullet whizz past me and hit the wall by my head .
at chimneys ?
mr jones and the prime minister will have left long before then .
constantine and i have already discussed together .
professor eckstein is here , sir .
im telling you this for what its worth .
a further blow dealt me by fate was the loss of my dear carlo .
on the parapet mrs .
hale said : well , i proceeded according to routine .
went over the place with a toothcomb .
it was michael gorman .
it is a very lovely ring , he said .
i wonderdo you think , jerry , it could have been something that aime griffith said ?
they asked for dr .
before his deaththat is so .
the first bottle was finished quite quickly .
what sort of ways ?
the boy replied eagerly and confidently as though at last he had overcome his fear and was quite sure of what he was saying .
molly would have hated it if id fetched a doctor when it wasnt necessary .
upstairsyou know .
nothings forcing me to travel , said jane wistfully .
i hope you havent hurt yourself ?
those two people are mr .
i shouldnt have thought anyone did .
so i thought the only friendly thing to do was to help you get some .
one from major blunt will be forthcoming in the morning .
whoever now told you that ?
well , there wont be anymore funny business , said inspector bacon grimly .
second murderer ?
hes trying to raise a loan now , you say ?
it does seem quiet , doesnt it , said ann , looking round .
theres the pixys cave at sheepstor on the moor .
gives his wife her head too much .
naturally i can speak more freely here than in a coroners court .
it was dear of you to ask me , dear and sweet .
on a round table were various magazines and sporting papers .
in much deeping , you could either take the garsington road , or the road to long cottenham , or you could go up shadhanger lane to the main londonbournemouth road two miles away .
why did he have to look round in that furtive manner ?
theres the river , of course .
why then , we might have a look at the motives of the other people in the house .
go over the edge ?
thats really why im always with her .
he could bully people , none better , but this was not a case for bullying , and he did not wish either , she was sure , to appeal to her , to beg her to do him a favour , to urge her to redress a wrong .
things do depend a bit on who you know .
there were to be no shortcuts to the truth .
he murmured in a tentative manner : your brother seems always to have been very muchwell , how shall i put itunder your fathers thumb .
weve been asked to make certaininquiries .
poirot was saying good-bye to geraldine marsh and miss carroll .
when did you last see your husband alive ?
gudgeon rose respectfully to his feet .
its a painful subject .
do what was necessary perhaps in the way of sending him money for support , but never thinking of him again .
it seems to me , poirot , that youve acted in a criminal manner , i cried angrily .
it was , i thought , a little unlike him .
it is true that the countess reminded me of someoneit puzzled me .
what wouldnt you have thought ?
he demanded irritably .
on the other hand , at least three would be capable of causing death .
but they were to come back to me with significance later .
you do not object , i hope , elena ?
and then , quite suddenly , the idea came to mestarted by a chance remark uttered during casual conversation .
she turned to sophia .
miss adams took it straight from her handbag and gave it herself to the maid to post .
voices shouted , whistles blew , doors were banged shut .
he was also a great collector of furniture , particularly old oak .
he added , hes very handsome , isnt he ?
miss rhoda , she was the dashing one .
how often must i tell you that clues come from within ?
she went on and on .
bull mastiff puppies , read out mrs .
a lot of money in the gamble , i suspect ?
surely it couldnt have been anything else .
as a matter of fact ive noticed it , said beck unexpectedly .
bradley had turned out to be a quack practitioner , or a pseudoastrologer , youd still be unconvinced .
wellhow shall i put itits difficult for him socially .
you had the charge of a young girl , a subnormal but very rich girl .
he takes everything seriously .
come on , boys , try to come up with something .
it was a very poor one , i thought .
but why spence interrupted him .
was there a faint hesitation ?
i love you so very much , hester , but ive got to know the truth .
she left everything as it was and tramped across country to bagshot police station where she reported the death .
it is a crime that shows traces of a cool , resourceful , deliberate braini think an anglo-saxon brain .
so we got out of that with no more than a small fee to the agents .
jennifer took it and tried a swish or two with it .
then we found a second victimstabbed with the same dagger .
groves , with an aggrieved expression and mop and duster in hand , had been waiting on the landing .
i am even looking farther back still .
i cant do without you any longer , anne .
she handed it to her employer .
presumably the man has milk and vegetables and joints of meat and occasional whitings just like everybody else , but none of the people who make it their business to supply these things seem to have acquired any information .
yes , ive read that kind of bookand i suppose it was , as you said , pathpatho pathological , he said .
was that miss johnsons meaning ?
they have even studied your psychology .
it seems such an odd name to choose .
gingerly roberts tried the handle .
then what i want to know is , why the devil hasnt she ?
everythings all set for tomorrow .
mademoiselle blanche stayed for a while by the swimming pool .
fine words , said esa .
ratchett or his valet or the conductor .
miss emily trefusis .
i dont touch the stuff myself .
since the real veronica (or venetia) would shortly be arriving from england , a retreat in good order was necessary .
there be a fte over to squires on friday , and i sez to myself , i sez , neither mr .
the others followed him .
he observed her now , covertly .
her lips were closed , she stood quite still , one hand stretched out , the other clasping her needlework to her .
dont you think so , jane ?
they must have , said wilfred .
poirot examined the window carefully .
but with me and sybil and mrs groves too , well , it does look as though there was something in it .
i should never commit the same type of murder twice running .
no reason for suspecting him then , but he had a key and he could have come over and killed her .
ive always wanted to meet a murderer and see for myself if theyre as genial and charming as the sunday papers always say they are .
and again hamer doubted .
but no interruptions , please (he looked at mrs .
here was a lanethat was better than icebergs , anyway .
she said clearly , but without passion : i distrusted and disliked him .
there are a good many others situated like i ampoor companionsuntrained useless women with nothing to look forward to but a deadly fear .
now , then , how much of all this is cleared up ?
hercule poirot inquired gently .
hasnt been seen yet in the zoo with his arm round a zebra , but i dare say that will come !
so violent and inartistic .
she could easily show it to mrs .
i know , i know , cried mr .
i delight in a good murder , and besideswell , knowing derek makes a difference .
in fact if we dont apply for one , anybody might ask why the dickens not ?
the examining magistrate has been awaiting you with the utmost impatience .
he added .
they would have been together herenownot packing up the house for selling , but redecorating it , planning new beauties in house and garden , walking side by side in gentle proprietary pleasure , happyyes , happy togetherbut for the fatal accident of a girls wild-rose beauty .
what do you ?
i must ask you to go to your room till i haveermade arrangements .
please go away .
said tommy , but i shall be a super desmond .
poirot , i cried , did you do that ?
i mean , the table-turning .
starkwedder looked at her from across the room .
this growing impatience , this irritable tiredness , it had some deeper significance .
we must get hold of frankie as soon as possible .
i did not arrive in time to prevent my clients death , but i feel myself bound in honour to discover the assassin .
that sounds unconvincing , she said .
he conned its phrases over and overi have news of captain robert underhaybest to approach youi shall be pleased to go into the matter with you mrs .
make no mistake .
he was talking more or less at random , to give ronny time to recover himself .
no , no , i must resign myself to the fact that all here is clear and aboveboardbut who is this ?
and he wasnt ?
the sum he offered was to be exciting .
je suis entirement de votre avis , he said smoothly .
i lost mine when i came out this year , and you would not believe the fuss they made about it .
i believe hed lie himself blue in the face if it was necessary to protect one of the family !
clayton arrived here .
shes resting .
lombard said , half bringing out the revolver from his pocket : ive got this , you know .
jimmy looked chagrined .
i when giles came back from seeing dr .
but a dentist !
i can do what i like .
she seemed as though about to say something , but did not do so .
but frankie and her two brothers were not asked to the vicarage .
he couldnt understand lenins dictum : away with softness .
nothing whatever , said mrs .
you mean youve got the murderer ?
her face took on a receptive expression .
then a door opened and superintendent nash stepped out into the hall with symmington behind him .
the chair falls with a crash , and he bends over sir reuben .
told me to go to regent gatetheyd tell me which house when they got there .
miss marple said gently : you werent , of course , quite yourself .
bundle went across and pulled it open .
you are a busy man .
you can read up trials .
but what i really think is that hes a bit unbalanced , you know .
i say to you : make a purchase quelconqueand you deliberately choose the strawberries !
he unbuckled the strap of his camera and got busy .
to begin with im rich , and im moderately good-looking , and ive got a lot of influential friendsand none of those unfortunate disabilities they talk about so freely in the advertisements nowadays .
that was all .
from miss lawson i learn about the missing money .
poirot wished her good morning very pleasantly as we passed .
in his game of rousing the greed and emotion of his children , he would not omit anyone .
poirot finished the sentence for her .
and i wont have it .
poirot said somewhat sententiously : it is true that there are many strange things in life .
cayley came out on the terrace , mr .
but , my dear alix , you do know all about me .
shoreham spoke again and she took the words from him .
she demanded in a rather schoolgirl manner .
it will be an almighty crash , if that goes , my father remarked .
not so many amahs , even , as there used to be .
then , feeling very much better , i went across to poirot .
nobody could have been kinder than lady limerick .
race was inclined to think that marrying a rich man was not enough .
you wouldnt think that miss blacklock cared about murders and games and things , would you ?
i dont know , miss bennett replied .
the motive , thats what i cant get .
have i had an accident ?
one of our fellows will just ask you for a few suggestions and work the whole thing up for you .
anyone might have seen through a rather transparent device like that .
it was easy , for at that time suspicion had not begun to set in .

he said he didnt know what it was like because hed never been there himself .
so you arranged the whole thingthe clippswho are the clipps ?
it was about half past seven .
ive heard my husband say that nothing can be done without regular methods .

bunch turned and left the church rapidly .
he was an american citizen ?
i invited melchett to partake of potluck with us , but he excused himself on the plea of having to go to the blue boar .

still , as you say , sir , that would have been the commonsense thing to do .
so he knew about it ?
why , you wouldnt recognize a frog croaking if you heard it .
she had dropped down a little in it .
a very ugly old lady , but rather fascinating .
this world had seemed a very good place to anthony cosden .
much amused , pippa got to her feet .

bantry , and pretty widely spaced .
' asked mrs hill .

i looked across at that house on the pointgulls point , as i know it now to be .
i know it looks badcoming out with this afterwards .
weve got a hoover , said mrs .
my sermon !
instead , after a nervous glance at laura who now sat staring at the floor , he went up to julian farrar , and murmured , about that little matter , sir .
cleat so as to keep on the right side of her so that she shouldnt ill wish them .

mildred strete was silent for a moment .
marry me .

he was engaged by my father .
so the prodigal son had been summoned home , he said .
poirot said , with a sudden ring of authority in his voice : i have had to show you the possibilities !
his house might have been appointed as a rendezvous by accident , or for some obscure motive that i had not fathomed .
if it means what you suspect it means , then they are both of them in it togethershe and the stiff englishman .
i received a letter from him which explained nothing .
you can guess , i dare say .
shall i point that out to the inspector ?
my card , madame , and if i can be of assistance to you at any time , tell me .
my sister was nice to me , while my brother called me kid and was loftyso naturally i attached myself to him whenever he permitted it .
if they did , they may have wondered who she was .
lots of bad blood between them .
poirot replied : colonel race and i must interview all the passengers .
she herself had not coveted linnet ridgeways money , but she had loved simon doyle , had loved him beyond reason and beyond rectitude and beyond pity .

sarah leaned forward , her pale , intelligent face very serious .
he had gone for the safe sensible thing that he had known would work and had relinquished the intangible dream that might lead him he knew not where .

it is iago we should have remembered .
look here , he continued , i can put up a very pretty case for macgregor having been the killer .
i mourned for you many yearsand after long long years only did i take a concubine so that i might live as befits a man not yet old .
boyle , the murderer , retreating across the hall , heard you coming out of the kitchen , and slipped into the cupboard , pulling the door to after him .
well , i could .
but when we come across someone with a high level of intelligence he paused .
shortly afterwards , he went into the consular service .
tim said with a flash of humour : always the gentleman !
we are to touch nothing .
victoria powdered her nose and patted her hair and started down the stairs in search of information .

i shall be boredbut after all , painters must eat .
for the worst part of murder , hastings , is its effect on the murderer .

mcgillicuddy looked into the lighted first-class carriage that was only a few feet away .
oh , no , you wont do that .
the cause of the last death was never determined , but i was told by a doctor who saw the corpse that it was burnt and shrivelled as though a wave of electrical energy of incredible power had passed through it .
actually it was not .
her answer came clear and prompt .
unfurnishedto buyor rent .
the case for the prosecution , but not the case for the defence , i said , smiling .
and she left me .
elsie macnaughtons voice was still kinder as she said : you really must not take these things to heart , sir george .
he looked thoughtfully at lucy .
it was indeed characteristic of bundle to be in a hurry , especially when driving a car .
but the name seemed familiar in some other way .
gudgeon went out and closed the door .
bantrys attention had strayed to the tennis court .
after breakfast , dorcas came up to me rather mysteriously , and asked if she might have a few words with me .
of course , its all nonsense her thinking that uncle was poisoning her .
as i say , you thought no one saw youbut i saw you , dereek , mon ami ; i saw you coming out of the compartment of madame your wife just before the train got into lyons that night .
and you dont believe her ?
always i pay homage to beauty when i meet it .

i made an immense effort .
if you read the papers carefully , you will find that often a nice respectable woman of that age leaves a husband she has lived with for twenty years , and sometimes a whole family of children as well , in order to link her life with that of a young man considerably her junior .
she said smiling : how does it look after all these years ?
well , im a bit worried sometimes .
i wonder why said miss marple , and broke off .
but in that particular case , the mother never protested her innocence .
parker pyne who paid , not claudeor , rather , it was really her own two hundred guineas .
we dont do as much in wigs now as we used to do .
it is incredible , monsieur .
somewhere in her inner consciousness was an awareness of the usual early-morning noises of the household .
vincent was a very pretty girl , she had her mothers delicate features , and the same proud turn of the head , but her eyes were dark instead of blue , and she had a different mouth , a sulky red mouth not without attraction .
now if , after bristol , anyone saw a lady in a bright blue coat and skirt , and a fur toque , he will be quite ready to swear he had seen mrs carrington .
then , later , i went into the sea and christine went back to the hotel to get changed for tennis .
my husbandah !
delilahthats what she should have been calledand she played her part well !

you remember how she looked ?
nevile said : latimer ?
you are obviously a very clever man in your profession .
richard amory held out a hand .
no one else .
it was a simple statement of fact , but there was a certain wistfulness behind it .
at first she , as it were , felt her way about the stage , seeing the thing , not hearing it ; seeing the movements and the lighting , how the whole thing would look .
every conceivable thing that could be done was tried .
the idea is absurd !
ohi see .
shes incapable of liking anything .
i said , have you paid for it , grandfather ?
youre seeing the world .
he didnt know the make of the car (it was dark by then) but it was a black or dark blue saloon driven by a middle-aged man .
she might be as innocent as she appeared .
cried freda .
startled , he agreed to perform the ceremony .
it was not true .
i can tell you , m .
i wanted to hear her own account of the disaster .
she had laid her own plans and made her own arrangements .
he probably told her he had some surprise for her .
' ' i wake up .
miss zielinsky looked interested .
dittisham said sharply : just what do you mean by that , mr .
yes , said calgary in a low voice .
his clothes are terrible .
he said : will you please come up to mr cornworthys room ?
this had happened before many times , said leo with a sigh .
thank god there are still chaps who will take a risk .
what put such an idea into your head ?
she fell forward , and that ' s how the bloodstain came on the table .
yes , he said , he had made a will for the late mrs .
he shook his head , however , and the inspector proceeded .
put a piece of wedding cake under your pillow and youll dream of your future husband .
unlike nursing , where there always was something to do , dispensing consisted of slack or busy periods .

she looked at him apprehensively .
tommy slept badly that night .

why didnt you come at once ?
her arrival had all the importance of a stage entrance .
you thinkthat ?
to this , josephine merely replied : i must wash .
nothing what you might call spicy from beginning to end .
i was a little surprised to find you doing this type of job .
capel ?
poirot , she doesnt like the things that are going on .
a simple but satisfying meal , that is what i prescribe .
there is a big grandfather clock there , and as the hands drew near to twelve i dont mind confessing that i was as nervous as a cat .
there was a knock on my doorin the hotel in heliopolisat least i thought it was on my door and i looked out , but it wasntit was one door down , sir rupert crofton lees .
she was playing the air that i had heard annette sing in paris .
the tan of his face was suffused .
not a pleasant friend for neviles wife !
instead he picked out a word .
he walked towards the door .
and i must say i think they are justified .
but its not the countess with billits bundle .
i doubt if you would have enjoyed staying at home as much as you think , said miss blacklock .

he had seen the volume through the press , had looked upon the results and , apart from a really incredible number of printers errors , pronounced that it was good .

the ring in her voice excited me .
this evening , he said , i pay you a visit .
their exchange continued quietly but urgently .
' yesterday .

ii somewhat wearily tommy alighted from his fourth taxi of the day and looked appraisingly at his surroundings .
its the thought of geraldwell , hereheres what all the troubles about !
pottery is more interesting than gold , said doctor carver .
i also think , i went on , that my private detective has a few more things up his , her or its sleeve .

he shuffled along a little faster .
all that came too late .
suddenly something in the bolt itself seemed to rivet his attention .
his father said : sit down , boy , youll knock something over david said : my mother simeon said : your mother had the brains of a louse !
i dont knowit seems queer .
i shall have to disarrange myself .
i quite agree with your reasoning .
thats quite all right , mr .
who were there exactly ?
to hell with a civil tongue .
it is much better that you should not .
he had been dreaming very happily of fishing an english river .
for once theres a death one doesnt like to think theres been harsh words spoken and no chance of taking them back .
the two parts simply did not fit .
blore said soothingly , thats right .
that , and his ordering a table for six when i knew only five were coming , made me suspect she stopped , biting her lip .
its only a matter of eighteen miles or so from here , said the chief constable .
hes obviously very fond of you .
instead he said , looking round him : it is indeed a beautiful property that you have here .
with polly , on the other hand , it was all she could do to feed and clothe her family after her husbands death .
i cant tell you , sir , said mr .
but does onedoes onestay here ?
her condemnation of mrs .
but she merely said : no , there was really only one thing that everyone did know about him .
a glance from her bedroom window shortly before dinner had been highly satisfactory .
i dont suppose shell stay after this , said pagett .
as a matter of fact , lucas , ive been thinking over what we were talking about the other day .
it would be no use on earth asking any of you young people to use the dustpan and brush in the old-fashioned way .
sure , that is , in my own mind .
welman died .
ii major barry came out to greet them on arrival .
it was open at the right page for andover and lying face down .
well , i should think so , because i think if she were trying to get rid of himwell , i dont think theyd have gone for a walk together and shed have to have taken the revolver with her in a handbag and it would have been rather a bigger handbag if so .
he moved rather stiffly and his hand went to his posterior and rubbed it gingerly .
perfectly , perfectly , said the frenchman .
ask celia !
well , ill be off .
poirot interrupted him .
his son regarded him steadily .
i dont blame her if so .
dangerous they are , mushrooms .
and you put another string on the ukelelebut it was the wrong string , thats why you were stupid .
began fussing about the damned thing and sure enough there was a washer wedged in the spare gear pump .
i remembered suddenly what nick had said about frederica : that she was not always herself .
at least i have succeeded in upsetting his alibi .
she left the room , and i turned to griselda .
well , well , jackos luck was out that night .
you told me a lot of other things .
it was that girl , ursula bourne , wasnt it ?
whose property had the sugar cutter been at the time ?
besides , she was by no means sure that sir charles had murdered his friend .
her small foot tapped impatiently on the ground .
hercule poirots flat was essentially modern in its furnishings .

yes , it could be so , but i hadnt thought of it that way .
its a huge concern .
one day she came to my mother , looking very nervous , and said : i hope you wont mind , maam , but i really feel i must go and join the waafs .

and he will be able , at his leisure , to come back and destroy this solitary piece of evidence against him .

his hand rested for a moment on mr .
id sent subscriptions to odd things , but i felt the need of doing somethingwell , something personal .
i hope so , i am sure , said poirot politely .
her husbands been dead two years .
colonel race begged her to go on and in return for this politeness received the life history of hector marle , of his upbringing by his sister , of his peculiarities and his weaknesses and finally , when colonel race had almost forgotten her , of his marriage to the beautiful viola .

its you who started this conspiracy against me and now youre going to pay for it .
he hasnt our experience .
feared drowned .
dodo you want me to look at her right away ?
this is all very irregular , mrs .
then i said : the typewriters your best bet , isnt it ?
the inspector looked at clarissa .
his passion was observing human nature , and he was an expert in his own special linethat of an onlooker at life .
is he marriedgot a family ?
you did uncommon well for a beginner .
my place is just near here , come in and have a drink .
oh quite !
but what does that matter ?
but why should they do it to us ?
its damned libel .
most estimable character , our miss sainsbury seale .
but she was so youngi didnt feel it would be fair to tie her to a disillusioned man .

very fishy .
england !

i watched when we got on the open road .
shes only been here a fortnight .
george shifted uneasily .
on a table in the morning room there was a heap of papersall the papers that the late mathew stroud had left .
miss russell pursed up her lips .
john ingles from the s .
i was going to say that i cant do that unless you untie my arms .
so i thought of ruby and suggested to the manager that i should get her down .
even murder , said hercule poirot .
eve carpenter said vehemently : theres a man herea foreigner .
yes , reggie gave it to her .
why , its quite satisfactory , isnt it ?
well , ann , you know i think youre wonderful .
as it is , i just cash in .
it had been a near thing , that !
poirot leant forward , looking at her .
rose said : he was frightfully inquisitive .
and you think that a clever man might take advantage of such a moment .
so im thinking of taking some other paper .
all right , thensomewhere round about quarter to half past twelve .

he took my hand in both of his .
i cannot say exactly when she left me .
' observer fontana paperbacks fiction fontana is a leading paperback publisher of both nonfiction , popular and academic , and fiction .

after a minute examination of the table and the exact position it had occupied , he asked to see the chessmen .
it occurred to bundle for the first time that it was odd the morning papers had contained nothing of the tragedy .
rathole , he said , was a very interesting place .
_num_ , and i had a bit of a job getting that .
im quite devoured by curiosity .
most of these seemed singularly meaningless to her , but she carried them out to the best of her powers .

shes the type .
then he said : ' well , thank you , mr carrington , that is all .
yes , said poirot , theres always possibility and something that waits for many years and then comes home to roost from somewhere in the past .
isnt this rather flat ?
he said , about that childshall we ?
three i well , really , mr .
then suddenly george leaned forward .
and so we bought greenway .
very ill , i said .
instead he went straight to the kitchen .

harold had spent some pleasant hours in the company of mother and daughter , but they did not attempt to monopolize him and relations remained friendly and unexacting between them .
lord caterham sighed .
theyre not .

i drew her to me .
on the contrary , i arrived in nice on the morning of that day , so what you suggest is impossible .

he was silent a moment and then went on , she is a young lady very much in the news , mademoiselle joanna southwood .
i remember your laying stress on the words when you repeated them to us .
for a long time there was a silence , broken only by the rustle of papers and an occasional word of explanation from the german .
abusing of him proper , said elsie with relish .
good lord , said colin , do you mean that on christmas day when grandfather was eating his pudding that that was a real ruby hed got in his mouth ?
well , sharpe reflected for a moment .
yes , i was quite sure of that .
but cinderellain the hands of the big four !
' so you have already said .
and he thought : doesnt the man realize ?
ill tell you what she said to me .
the house seemed in a rather tumbledown condition with gutters that could do with repairing .

they dressed the body of the tramp in a suit of renaulds and left his ragged coat and trousers by the door of the shed , not daring to take them into the house .
edwards a dear .
he smiled at egg .
i hope you are feeling better now , miss peake ?
walking with henrietta hed forget that there were any sick people in the world .
no , it wrinkles on the shoulder ?
why did you come back here and pretend to play bridge ?
therefore , as you must see for yourself , the only people whom she would have admitted , had they called to her from outside and asked her to do so , were the people who had actually arranged the murder hunt .
i didnt mean anne protheroe , said miss marple .
damned swines of germans .
baker .
he was all right when i left him just now , said jimmy .
shell just have to tell her story of how she found the body .

i didnt really think so , said bundle .
he thought : best of an island is once you get thereyou cant go any farther youve come to the end of things .
youre getting a bit too sensational , i think , poirot .
he resumed his prowling about the room .
yours very sincerely , elinor carlisle letter from mary gerrard to nurse hopkins , july _num_ th : dear nurse hopkins , thank you so much for writing to me about father .

one moderately well-made young woman is very like another .
invitation , mention of mutual friendsi fell for it all right .

and it happened as i turns my head just as i was going out of the room .

the whole thing was very difficult .
the man came running back with one of his comrades in a state of some agitation and spoke to the dragoman in arabic .
so it happened that i never saw jane wilkinson again and only read in the paper of her trial and condemnation .
the breaking of a piece of bad news nearly always sets up a defence reaction .
its not a family name .
josie had loosened one of the stone balls on the balcony and she was going to let it crash down afterwards .
a week ago today , in this very room , we had an amazing , indeed an awe-inspiring experience .

moreover , he finds her demands on him increasingly irksome .
doncasterthats the place hes going to do his next murder , said mrs .
putting all personal considerations on one side , hes a more likely starter than jim ?
coleman took them out and was sorting them out into bundles and putting rubber bands round them .
no , i think they were in martinique or tobago at the time .
ill then tim kendal lost control of himself .
miss waynflete nodded her head thoughtfully .
had it been her all along who had written those anonymous letters ?
lady angkatell said softly : i want you to do something for me .
you wont go out after dark , will you ?
sybil , how long have we had her ?
do you know , i find it rather difficult to say .
only it doesnt seem quitewell , quitei dont know what i had better do about it .
frankie sprang out and went into the house without a backward glance .
then i found that shed never turned up that morning to work at allsent no message eitherold madame was furious about it .
two minutes later they were in the car , and it was threading its way through the streets of leatherbarrow .
peritonitis and she died on the operating table .
it is just as well that she should be under skilled supervision .
erthat is to say , is it necessary for us all to go ?
where is mademoiselle now ?
i cant stand a fuss .
i meant the pale horse .
you recognized it , then ?
on this occasion the bank were struck by something a little unusual about the sealing of the packet .
there have been broads a good many years , too .
the attendant replied respectfully that it should be done .
nothing was known of the antecedents of miss elsa hardt , and she disappeared suddenly about the time of valdarnos death .
he was , i fancy , enjoying himself to the the full .
shall we say friday at eleven thirty ?
he flings the pistol out of the window into the privy garden , rushes downstairs and out through the billiard room .
poirotfor gods sake .
thats a point , admitted emily , i didnt think of that .
ames ?
im starving , superintendent battle .
nothing the matter with so and so , they say .
i was convinced that he had come back into the schoolroom solely in order to talk to me .
his chair into which he falls (in genuine agony this time) is by a window .
said poirot in a low voice .
my friend , i am about to surprise youto please you !
she was a sensible woman , so though it was a terrible wrench for her to give up her house in ealing and her friends and all the rest of it , she saw plainly that she would be helpless living there alone and that servants were unlikely to stay .
quite right , said david , rosaleens rather stupid .
and the doctor looked at them .
she shook her head , smiling faintly .
he set to work methodically .
all the same , its a shame , burst out bobby .
it was an angry , malevolent face .
iii ive looked through all the lockers in the pavilion , sir .
her face grew very pale .
he was all shaking and oh !
f .
sorry , dearest .
and an english doctor !
yesbut they didnt come out of it unscathed .
but one of them might be stuffed fish .
it is highly unlikely that agatha christie ever saw this film herself (or , in fact , even knew of it) as prints of it have surfaced only in the last twenty years .
i have not pretended to be aware of all the details of your show .
that person was not mrs .
well , im sorry .
their aims for their daughters are shortsighted and quite frankly stupid .
we have got absolutely and positively to find out what is going to happen tonight .
funnyi should have thought theyd have made rather a splash about it .
in england for that purpose ?
oh , of course .
there , glimmering white and snowy , enveloped in a delicate rose-coloured mist , rose the glistening pinnacle .
are you sure , entwhistle , that somebody hasnt beenwell , playing up the sensational ?
there was nowhere else where a man could hide .
ill come straight to you .
x had strangled helen in the hall , but afterwards he took her upstairs and arranged her artistically as a crime passionel on the bed , and thats where kelvin is when he comes to ; and the poor devil , who may have been suffering from jealousy where shes concerned , thinks that hes done it .
in his neat precise manner mr .
he had a dressing room and bath , of course , and so did she .
somehow or other to regain touch with humankind .
so you have .
we examined it closely .
i will fetch her .
she was running water into the sink when miss blacklock entered .
there could be no real urgency , and whoever it was would soon go away .
andwhere was i detailing your future plans .
we can get another like it , i said .
call me if necessary , nurse edmonds , said sister barker , and get miss marple anything she may need .
you call that evidence against david hunter ?
gone completely native .
this poisoned dart business sounds like him .
it was a fine big sum of money that you could never achieve by any other means except luck .
open at the page for bexhill .
pierce was looking at him with a kind of eager gratitude .
hows emerson ?
i and some cousin in australia are the only ones left of the family .
it was a carefully laid plot .
it was some time later .
kept in the poison cupboard in the dispensary .
oh , my lady !
after thatoblivion .
so i resolved to go one better .
hallo , bryan , said alexander kindly to his father .
not till i know what youve got on me .
you ask that because you are youngso young , mademoiselle .
of course , one can cut it out later , but that is irritating , and destroys the smooth flow which one gets otherwise .
jack argyle wasinnocent !
she had been up with mrs .
nothing insubstantial or fairylike about her .
hell be all right , said the superintendent .
delicately hercule poirot sniffed the air .
when they got there , micky said : you go in , tina .
i succeeded !
he replied to susans inquiry by saying that miss gilchrist was much better .
of course it was easy for the bakers van to follow me to the station and someone came up behind me and heard me book to yarrow .
im going in to fetch them in the car .
someone who has got a down on the famous houses of england .
but he didnt walk the same way .
poirot and lynn were left alone .
he was in many ways a peculiar man .
suggestibleit is in that word that the mystery of mr .
and the man who has enacted the part of the prime minister ?
he said : i value that group very much .
he didnt try to enter into conversation with you at all ?
if you can fix that , frankie , nothing could be better .
kettering , he said politely ; no , i do not think we need trouble you any further .
i always went through it to school .
com agatha christie ordeal by innocence to billy collins with affection and gratitude if i justify myself , mine own mouth shall condemn me .
lucia caught his arm , with a cry of alarm .
but i wasnt being a fool .
there were many other ivories , some perhaps of even greater beauty than the head , if not so spectacular .
he had a high-domed forehead and a beautiful white beard .
together they stared out along the faade of bertrams hotel .
thank you , lady eileen .
if james bentley did not kill mrs .
ill get you some more laces this morning , mrs .
her thoughts ran round in circles like squirrels in a cage .
satipy , like sobek , was all bold words and talk .
i never stuck to anything .
mercado sat down in the vacant place by mrs .
stephen said : baby !
i thought the same myself the other day .
he glanced down at tommys card lying on his deskberesford rang up and had a few words with me .
very unsatisfactory , isnt it , inspector ?
the latter looked after the car admiringly .
we met and got married .
shes one of the kindest women ive ever met .
not one who lives in the past .
well , i dont really .
they are handed to the bank , and the bank send them to england .
bit of a thunderstorm last night .
hank ryder doesnt lose his bearings tommy hauled him along unceremoniously .
i had invented some extraordinarily witty things that the strike leaders said to me and i said to the strike leaders .
very littlecuriously littleso the doctor said .
thank you for lending me this , he said .
everybody talks too much , they say .
who divided the house and why ?
we had both seen angela sutcliffe in a play in london five years ago .
then miss marks , the fair-haired secretary , was called , and wept and went into hysterics and admitted that there had been passages between her and her employer , and that he had promised to marry her in the event of anything happening to his wife .
her hand all cold and flabby .
sister bond ate sister westhavens egg !
the only thing i was glad about was that i hadnt got to do it .
i dropped a hand into my pocket .
she repeated the substance of her conversation with the girl .
as a variant he had pushed through a baize door and slipped into the larder .
i wont stand for it dont shout at me , nevile .
very well , if you will do nothing , i will .
but youre here at last !
hadnt seen each other since , i believe .
i dont suppose many people did , said luke , and departed after the exchange of farewells .
lukethe christian name uttered so easily gave him a queer warm feeling .
curious thingthree in the morning is my usual time for bye-bye , but tonight , just because i know weve got to sit up a bit , id give anything to be a mothers boy and turn in right away .
iii so you have been outside the house ?
entry of the trump card , the mysterious monsieur x , remarked anthony .
there was no doubt that he was a fine-looking man seen face to face .
excuse me , mr .
quite sure i wouldnt shoot you ?
i asked , struck by the dissatisfaction of his tone .
lee would soon see to that !
he was really very rude to arthur , and since then arthur wont hear a good word for him .
i should imagine that such a patronage must be very galling to people who regard themselves as the rightful heirs !
iii after her mother had left the ladies room , miranda waited for a minute or two .
and you yourself were sittingwhere ?
its not the sort of place that one can imagine hiding anything .
so why that quick , guilty glance round ?
and i dont know how to set about it .
if she travelled or if shed been out and got very dishevelled and wanted to tidy herself in a hurry , or sometimes shed use one that was suitable for evening wear .
oh i dont .
i looked at him then .
' kidnapping is an easy job , mon am/ , ' he observed , as he hailed a taxi in the hammersmith road and ordered it to drive to waterloo .
but i can tell you , entwhistle , that the worry affected my health most unfavourably .
as poirot came up from brealffast he found the two girls all ieady to go on shore .
yahmose agreed .
the psychological approachthats the only thing nowadays , the colonel told him .
but that was because i didnt know what love was .
he murmured : i wonder now .
i said so to him .
poirot frowned at it and withdrew it from the lock .
thats right , george , he drawled .
archie only saw the essential itself .
sir rufus herschman had not been flattered physically , but everard had succeeded in putting on the canvas a personality that was unforgettable .
i could not but admire the girls courage .
superbyes , superb !
something that i really feel i must find out .
he was silent for a moment , and then he said : no , gwenda , no .
she looked round her and thought : its goodbye to all thisto my own worldmy own way of life .
_num_ you werent satisfied , said poirot , when that extremely difficult young man was arrested .
the remarks that inspector craddock improvised to address to edmund apply far more aptly to you .
she said quickly , shes coming up to find us .
what could there be ?
i expect youre right , said sir charles .
battle smiled grimly .
games , you know .
on the following morning he went up to town , there to meet a friend who was thinking of starting a garage and who fancied bobbys cooperation might be valuable .
without the documents and files these entries are meaningless .
that would be a real mistake , said philip .
he said he didnt like picnics .
it is a chance , that is all .
that was the word i used .
when did he stop ?
magdalene was vehement .
poirot , who had been sitting in a dream , gave a start .
ten dr .
easterbrook , you say , is in london .
on his unexpected return : it does not matternow .
van aldin was informed that mr .
stilling fleet .
i wouldnt do anything like that .
vandemeyer motioned to a chair .
he was in here only yesterday and mrs .
boxes shut , but they also open .
how exciting , said tuppence .
) but with perfect efficiency , miss lemon had fulfilled her task .
as the two men turned , it opened slowly , and tredwell , the butler , stood in the doorway .
a few minutes later you gave the alarm that the dog had been stolen .
instead , sarah walked with carol and lennox .
kennedy told us that kelvin halliday believed that his wife was secretly drugging him , and kelvin halliday in his diary confirms thatso there is another factand a very curious fact it is , dont you think ?
you dont think morley shot himself because of a mistake ?
he went on , i understand the inquest was adjourned .
' the boy took the hint easily enough .
has been making enquiriesand it does really seem as though this stamfordis man was thoroughly undesirable .
here , she had thought , things will be different .
why should you think that ?
no , the sixth point i will keep to myself for the present .
but my mother , always understanding , said that i needed a little time .
then he locked the door , and as an additional precaution put a chair against it .
goby had never been known to address the human being he was working for directly .
for the first time an invention isnt going to be sold to a nation .
or he may have said , i can point you out a murderer .
tanios _num_ .
he laughed half-apologetically , then looked curiously at his companion .
lancaster who gave it to miss fanshawe and she isnt with us any longer .
it isnt now .
he saw the colour come up in her cheeks .
instead he persisted in an idea of his ownsetting a trap for the murderer .
take a man like the late harry carter dr .
i can assure you , my dear miss knight , that miss marple can contemplate murder and sudden death and indeed crime of all kinds with the utmost equanimity .
fortune-telling ?
she looked round at them .
forget it all !
she was in good spiritsenjoyed our outing .
there he asked for particulars of houses to let on the river .
the man was looking at her sympathetically .
he grinned disarmingly .
he went into the house and returned shortly afterwards carrying two large glass mugs .
and a faint desolate chill struck through her as she reflected : edward will not have to wait very long .
perry came in through the door .
i understand , said inspector campbell , referring once more to his notes , that canon pennyfather left here about six thirty on the evening of thursday the _num_ th .
all rightall right sometimes they dont have any effect anymore she looked up in his face .
ohdo you really think ?
and what of the supposed letter from sir bartholomew strange asking young manders to arrange an accident ?
why does he say this ?
i dont like to think of youalone in some place under a false namewith nobody to keep an eye on you .
bexhill , i think , said sir henry , looking puzzled .
theres an awful lot ive got to tell you , he said , and stopped awkwardly .
there is nothing cautious about you , sobek !
x the case for the prosecution was opened by sir mortimer inglewood , k .
he says i ought to go right away somewhere for three or four weeks .
you havent got to go to london tomorrow ?
that must be pretty bad , but its almost worse to live all tangled up in conflicting affections .
because when i saw your revolver it reminded me of the shooting the night before .
we were all pretty bitter .
i am at my wits end .
she was a pretty kidbut most of what i saw in her i put there myself .
its been so pleasant meeting you and talking to you here .
a doctor in new york .
yes , a wheelchair , and i could fly to munich or somewhere like that .
it is a matter that affects my wifeaffects caroline .
she had been speaking of mrs .
he smiled and shook his head .
i think wed better do that , anyway .
she drew her breath in sharply with a hiss .
not that i have heard .
thats why he was called that .
messieurs , he said brusquely , will you follow me to the study ?
shed have said but , darling mike , you can have anything you like .
poirot , tell us .
poor old beveridge , freedom from want , freedom from fear , freedom from whatever it was , he thought he was making a heaven on earth by saying that and planning for it and getting it done .
ive nothing to do with the studios , actually , though of course i naturally take messages from there on the telephone or send them .
he was in bulawayo with mr .
old lanscombe looked surprisedsurprised and offended .
he lived at priors lodge in the grounds of which were the ruins of the old priory .
i sort of saw it allhow it used to bethe streets and the houses , and he showed me ovens where they baked bread and said the arabs used much the same kind of ovens nowadays .
you ' re frightening me - you ' re frightening me .
what about the shot ?
taken unawares , lucia gasped .
i am trying to accumulate a little nest-egg .
im deeply obliged to you , baker , he said .
and suddenly a fresh idea struck me .
a good day for hoeing .
yesyes , you may be right .
you thinkwhat ?
philips hand tightened excitedly in his chair .
i suppose he never received a letter or letters signed a b c ?
impressions can be very helpful sometimes , said grange .
may i speak to your guest ?
he is a man whom it is particularly easy tounderestimate .
first to examine the reluctance of miss waynflete .
miss lippincott , did you , on the night of saturday , overhear a certain conversation ?
i knew it was all wrong somewhere .
again flushing , simon said : i suppose jackie told you that id only married linnet for her money ?
burgess shivered .
old leathern wasnt a bad fellowlongwinded , of course , like most americansfond of telling endless long stories .
you listen , my pretty , for youre pretty enough , bad luck will come to whoever buys it .
i expect he will , said miss marple .
actually , im rather scared .
how unfortunate .
its not going to do anybody any good .
it was a very good place really .
aspirin tablets by letitia blacklocks bed .
so , thats it !
i asked , with a smile .
a man who wants to buy a little place would either get here earlier in the day , or else stay over the next day .
if you try it youll find yourself unconsciously describing somebody that youve noticed somewherein a tram or a train or an omnibus .
stillingfleet , my name is .
treves had spoken in simple admiration .
but why not ?
and stillsilence .
the doctor was puzzled .
he was nosing round , just as we were , looking for something fishyand this point struck him just as it struck us .
a shade formal .
i did not hear him return to the room .
it was queerer that it should be the chief suspect who should draw her attention to the fact .
the doctors gave me up years ago .
in spite of her laugh , mary was looking thoughtful this morning .
he had a sudden feeling that loraine in her innocence might say too much .
she passed through .
i should say that a lady like her wouldwell , would make some pretty bad enemieseh , sir , what do you say ?
when we started on the coach , i had a feeling that something would happen .
it would square with kelvin hallidays rooted belief that he had killed his wife , and it would square with the missing suitcase and clothes and with the note that dr .
dinsmead hesitated a minute , then he picked up the five cups , one after another , from the table and emptied them into a slop bowl .
the woman and betty walk down the hill together .
i should say they were .
i was looking at the time for someone to share a flat or a tiny house with me .
i strolled down to the beach and watched the bathers , without feeling energetic enough to join them .
the time was then twenty-six minutes or thereabouts past twelve .
though miss marple was perfectly agreeable to be called dear (and even ducks) by the woman at the greengrocer or the girl at the paper shop , it annoyed her intensely to be called dear by miss knight .
and if he isnt with her , hes usually grabbed by the henderson woman whos quite nice .
i have already written out a full account and sent it up to the society of psychical research .
i asked dole-fully .
you came to see my uncle .
well , theyre not there now .
renauld : there is another question .
there was no reason why he should go on coming to see the rest of them .
he did ?
there was no mystery about it , but no one seeing the yew hedge from the front would have guessed at the probability .
she said doubtfully .
but human nature being what it is , i murmured .
come out and have a bite of lunch .
hes taking it all rather seriously .
there was a bad outburst of the kind over the other side of the county last yearturned out to be the head of the millinery department in a big drapers establishment .
but what is there to do ?
im glad its quite certain she was dead before the car was set on fire .
poirot said : it was an admirably clear narrative , but there were certain omissions , were there not ?
you seriously believe that this man rivers was murdered ?
_num_ , red hair , blue-green eyes , mouth medium , no distinguishing marks .
the lights were on .
dane calthrop said sharply : like what , jane ?
so also did my friend hastings whom i have not seen for many , many years .
abandoning the fricasse of chicken which she had planned , she began to assemble the preparations for curry .
with my gift , i ought to be able to prevent it happening .
the countess refused with a small shake of the head .
erskine has made life a hell for her husband , and he , without being able to help it , has made life a hell for her .
all my family are abstainers .
miss emlyn seems to think that that might be so .
queer , said jack to himself , but there it is .
i wanted to put the case as clearly as i could .
are you staying here for long ?
not since babylon .
most people prefer somethingwell , shall i say slightly obvious like thathe pointed to a blue and green striped effect arranged in one corner of the canvasbut this , yes , youve spotted the quality of the thing .
he cried like a childwith abandon and without self-consciousness .
it was remotely possible that this was not his first killing .
i understood that you were not connected with the local police you understood rightly .
miss marple was patient and pursuing .
i ' ll leave you alone with sir george .
evelyn shook her head .
onlyi am perhaps old-fashionedbut me , i find the american woman less charming than my own countrywomen .
at five oclock she is in violent distress , and speaks of having had a great shock .
im not so sure i do want that .
the thing he held was not a pebble , it washe could hardly doubt itan emerald , an enormous green emerald .
yes , terry darlingits missus come home .
vera came forward in a competent manner .
the letter dropped from my hand .
it so often seems to hold good when you produce your answer .
are you sure you ' re not up to it ?
joe continued his tale with a certain gusto now that he had got wound up .
would she do that if she was guilty ?
i shall , said george with feeling .
he looked at the pictures on the walls , and finally he looked at jason rudd .
the commissionaire , who knew him well by sight , had put him into a taxi and had directed it as told by the canon , to the athenaeum club .
i remember seeing it there , said charles .
hercule poirot held his audience under the spell of his personality .
who amongst the other girls were her closest friends ?
he , stitchwort , and fondella .
yes , but this isnt at a price .
it would be the doctor and jean moncrieffe who would suffer .
her limbs ached , her eyelids were dropping .
but really , until i got a hint from dr .
i think you know where they are .
but of course i knew that that was impossible .
the stole , perhaps , but would she have got rid of the pistol , too ?
she said it quite naturally in an almost friendly tone .
we are only too delighted for miss percehouse to have it .
i acknowledged this , but assured her that everybody that she knew and that i knew in england went to dentists , opened their mouths , and had things done to their teeth which resulted in ultimate benefit .
if he were actually married to her when he met me i agree that it might be his duty to stick to herthough im not really sure of that .
yesor he may have tried a spot of quiet blackmail .
the inspector listened keenly , occasionally interjecting a question .
shed tell everyone abruptly mrs .
what had monsieur fanthorp heard and seen ?
and poirot himself must number among the suspects .
carter sighed in his tired manner .
you mean , why didnt i warn douglas gold ?
starting as always , boy meets girl .
he went to bectt also ?
please tell me all about it , miss marple , he said , but start at the beginning , wont you .
dora bunner , of course , knew nothing about all this .
now , monsieur , said poirot to donovan .
vincent interrupted him with a certain amount of determination : rupert !
albert appeared suddenly .
ah , she was a wicked devil , that one was .
some stranger , perhaps , whom she had met in the neighborhood .
what you might describe as very dead !
poirot ran nimbly up the stairs .
that is what one of your classics says .
its to be the day after tomorrow .
few people can have extraced more intense or more varied fun from life , and this book , above all , is a hymn to the joy of living .
one was dark and thin and the other was fair and sturdily built and the latters face seemed faintly familiar to miss marple .
very clearly and brightly told .
she came up to him and laid a hand on his arm , saying in a low voice : youd better go now , dr .
i ran into a very thick patch of it and i lost my way and i didnt know where i was .
i hopesaid mary dovei dont mean to be rude , inspector neelebut i hope we dont .
she said : look over your shoulder , midge .
my road leads me seawards , to the white dipping sails .
and i meanwhat would deb say to me ifif if i got it in the neck ?
said tuppence , i do agree with you .
brandy shell be needing , he said .
lord whitfield stretched himself back in his chair .
did you enjoy the food ?
it was well received and reviewed , but the person who was really pleased with it was myself , for i knew better than any critic how difficult it had been .
that would be very unsporting .
its all blurred .
now , she could not have been an easy old lady .
you thought it was suicide , didnt you , sandra , my dear ?
so thats what you think , is it ?
flecker , she said .
very interesting , murmured poirot and moved gently out on to the deck .
lucy , midge had to admit , was wonderful .
in fact , its out of my power to object .
but we cant waste time in telling sad stories of the deaths of kings .
on an impulse he put himself deliberately in her path .
i hadnt a suspicion of you !
tell her i sent you to her andah yes , perhaps youd better just mention the lady of shalott .
he seemed dumbfounded .
a little trap might be permissable .
nothing seems real to me .
it was a slack time .
and she took in a lodger ?
and there amongst a lot of other very unsuitable thingseven a tin or twoi saw a little bright metal boxnot an exact squarea sort of long square , if you understand what i mean but yes , i understand perfectly .
next to the drawing-room was the morning-room , where almost invariably a sewing-woman was ensconced .
it is women who ask always for happiness .
poirot wondered whether she herself realised how completely she had slipped into the role of hostess or whether it was entirely unconscious .
why did she call it kk ?
it was terrifying , put in miss bunner .
well , mister ?
tell it to me , madame , he said .
pyne , cant you do anything ?
he placed the gun on the table by the wheelchair , picked up the decanter , and poured brandy into a glass .
we were sorry about the sainsbury seale womanbut it was no good .
it isnt the real loftus naturally .
he said , it isnt a dream this time .
she did not seem different in any way ?
victoria went back into her room , sat on the bed , and gave herself up to speculation on her present position .
dupont lives for his profession .
he came back one day from a trip hed taken .
the page boy opened the door and said to midair : mr .
wellierhadnt considered yet .
is that your idea , tuppence ?
headquarters in stamboul but he has a shop in paris .
i know a bit more than freda does .
clarke , said poirot .
perfectlybut what price exactly ?
but she saw .
hehe seems very set on our coming .
i tore open the letter (poirot for once did not reproach me with untidiness) and extracted the printed sheet .
they seemed fully alive and intelligent .
no one suspects him as far as he knows !
i suppose , i said , that inspector slack would disdain such a simple course as asking the young lady straight out .
shrivenham thought it was crosbie of the i and p whom he had met once or twice .
thats why im here , isnt it .
but it wasnt my question .
there was nothing particularly original or artistic about the decorations , for bunch harmon herself was neither original nor artistic , but it was a homely and pleasant arrangement .
girl in the villageemmotts daughteremmott who keeps the blue boar .
never had she felt so strongly davids queer moody attraction .
i got it all out of him , little by little .
this is a story for your pleasure and not a candidate for mr .
tanios whispered : dont say ive been here .
nurse isnt to feel so much on duty that im not allowed out of her sight .
nofrets voice was soft and submissive .
im only a justice of the peace , he said .
nothing , said bundle .
death that came with dreadful swiftness and remorseless certainty to rich and poor alike .
i suppose .
if , by any possible chance , anyone did come to the house , i could do nothing to attract their attention .
he said : its the chauffeurrivers .
he could not have wished for a better man to be put in charge of the case .
after the cabaret , when you all went to dance , you dropped your bag .
at breakfastyes .
you were marrying me because i could give you a jolly good timeand so i can .
find out .
mary shivered a little .
tucker , speaking with some bitterness .
im not afraid of the police .
dont understand this place .
go in and go into the room on the right of the hall and wait .
we were lost in the bush .
thought poirot and let himself speculate .
the communication will be privileged , naturally .
the inspector paused before asking , now , whats all this about guns and revolvers andshooting at animals ?
well , im old , said lady matilda cleckheaton .
why , hes in madame tussauds !
eventually we got in .
what do you feel about this strange business of the clocks ?
makes you put it in every time .
lejeune repeated it , then handed the receiver over to corrigan .
theyre in the provinces , somewhere , i believeif theyre not resting .
and yet he never suspected me .
you see , she said , those cayman people came to see bobby after the inquest to ask him if the brother (supposed) had said anything before he died , and bobby said , no .
the greatthe unique !
listening had been her portion for ten years now .
youve got to be very careful when theres a husband and wife about , and thats a fact .
fourteen i the inquest took place two days later .
she took the last one two days ago , and she didnt have anymore made up .
i dont think there is anything suggestive about it .
broadribb , whose appearance somewhat contradicted his name .
mon cher , it is my habit to be neat and orderly .
well , susannes father was willing .
when she came back , i understand you were talking to mrs .
roderick had turned rather pale .
as i say , the shoes first awakened my suspicions , and then her storyand her veilwere a little melodramatic , eh ?
ones bored stiff in these airports .
there are times when i have been in errorbut this is not one of them .
ii that evening she heard a little more .
this is mr starkweddermajor farrar , who may be our next member of parliament .
then , with a slight effort , and looking straight in front of him as though the mere sound of his own words were distasteful he said : you have heard what i stated at the inquest .
' go to the expert and don ' t count the cost .
she said , and truly i think , that it would be even more difficult for her to part with madge as time went on and their companionship drew them closer .
first you make me come all the way back to england before i need im sorry about that , said miss marple ; but i couldnt do anything else .
he put it in his pocket , meaning to reswre it to mrs clapperton later .
some years ago .
after dinner mrs .
poirot she looked at him suspiciously .
i wondered , said inspector neele .
half smiling he raised the flute to his lips , then put it down again .
i wonder why shes getting so fat ?
dont you , clotilde ?
the spences won a little , but major rich was the chief winner .
such a change .
then she demanded her bill , with a new briskness in her voice .
he dismissed the man with a few curt words and then turned to me .
i didnt recognize you at first .
you remember my father , said judith .
i should like to hear all about prince nicholas , especially where he is at present .
about his being a fascist and an enemy agentyes , said tuppence coldly .
ready for the concussion .
i think its worth itreally .
and theres a stock exchange gentleman after it too .
the effect is almost like being in a gardenthough , of course , the flowers are all wrong .
jennifer flung her racquet down in despair .
chapman , mrs .
oh , well , said dr .
and so on .
i think that youll go very far , i said dreamily .
playing up in any way ?
the chief fact i remember about him was that he kept white mice .
opalsen tearfully .
marcia keane has been with me all along .
three , or even four doses , would not have resulted in death .
and to commit suicide was the most logical and sensible thing that could be done by a man in his position .
one box , for convenience , perhapsbut not six .
and well get back by candlelight .
that was his mtier .
i kept on badgering away at people .
it would be advisable , i think , for you to listen to me .
it was a night of strenuous excitement .
he read the letter we had brought and then looked at us across the top of his desk .
they sat down .
i loved heri always loved herno matter what she waswhat she didi wanted her safeto keep her safenot shut upa prisoner for life , eating her heart out .
hes not a very young man .
he added as i went out of the room : and be careful of the child .
it was strong and hot .
so it had not mattered much , and it would have been easier to hang both portraits .
the table started rocking slowly .
yet he is found murdered close at hand , almost within earshot of the house .
i love aunt edith very much .
perhaps he was a professional thief and finally went to prison for it .
if this boy is alive , he may have very valuable information to give us .
i passed through it some years ago .
why this frightful haste ?
welmans at hunterbury , wasnt he ?
again the master gave his heavenly smile .
in general terms , yes , i agree .
odd thing if those wretched diamonds were there all the time .
then she said to me : the songs you sang told me nothing , but the exercises do .
youd quite got the wind up about it , hadnt you ?
they might be able to produce papers saying that she was mentally afflicted .
i induced him to insure his life in my favour .
say that prior to meeting this mr .
half past nine .
and before you married her you were only a junior partner in the firmnot very long down from oxford .
one or two of the servants had been newly engaged , one of the footmen , i think , and some of the housemaids .
but ratchett certainly received one letter of a very different characterthe one containing a reference to the armstrong baby , a fragment of which we found in his compartment .
where did the ambulance take her ?
its the ghastly fact that all those people believe i took it .
coleman cheerfully .
entwhistle i would be willing to stay on until everything here was cleared up .
i would say it and i do say it .
whats he been in ?
she allowed him to go with her in the taxi , but to all his remonstrances she addressed a deaf ear .
poirot didnt condescend to explain .
they seem to be getting more and more frequent .
so he did on the previous night .
simon said doubtfully : shes got a small income , of course .
oh , the stupid little man , murmured hercule poirot .
victoria got up from the bench and richard who was sitting on the other end of it was thrown to the ground in a somewhat undignified posture .
taking the word to be compliment i though it a very obscure remark , but as nursie explained one day that to ask you to marry him was the highest compliment a gentleman could pay a lady , i began to see the point .
it showed very plainly the man who was sitting at the desk ; there were the distinctive features , the obstinancy of the chin , the quizzical eyebrows , the poise of the head , but the portrait had one thing that the man sitting in the chair beneath it lacked .
said miss burgess .
to be born with such a lust for power , such a desire for dominionand to achieve only a petty domestic tyranny !
what i want to know is whether youve ever seen this mr .
his reply was immediate .
the second said : lots of nice-looking girls here but not one thats a patch on you .
fortescue , but it seems she is out playing golf .
died having a baby and the baby died too .
what is comprised in that word ?
yes , starkwedder remarked with a somewhat bitter laugh .
i put some coal on the fire and went upstairs obediently .
a heap of charred fragments .
when she saw us , the colour left her cheeks , leaving her deathly white , and her eyes widened with apprehension .
the way people talk about things they know nothing whatever about is disgraceful .
only a maniac !
oh , l l !
tuppence stared .
ah , yes , your fastidiousness was revolted .
hearing the door , jeremy carefully placed the cushion over pippas feet .
she knew all about me (she was , as i have indicated , a good listener) but about her i knew nothing .
pictures in the paper and reporters coming round .
she was unconscious .
why on earth zena was advancing on him , clasping some rather sticky cards .
nearer at hand , sir georges voice rose with an amorous intonation .
there was a silence , and then the old man drew himself up proudly .
at the moment when she had settled things in birminghamwhat happens next ?
it stood as a symbolof the english climate , of the prudent forethought of the english race , of their attachment to old possessions .
as it was she had to pick her words carefully .
youve forgotten the german .
asked desmond .
requisitioned , said mrs .
leidner dryly .
she could already hear mrs .
the mother and daughter and mr .
protheroe , said the colonel thoughtfully .
now that she was playing a part , it was quite easy for victoria to ask it with every appearance of anxious sincerity .
it is like trying on the clothes .
it seemed to say : shall i tell you ?
and a good job too .
' dr stillingfleet said , ' it isn ' t the people who threaten to commit suicide who usually do it , you know , miss farley .
i couldnt say suddenly to nora bennington let me introduce my husband .
the brass knob of my bed , it twirls round .
hes got an appointment with a body , i believe , or is it an absconding financier , or the rajah of borrioboolagahs great ruby ?
emily had the kind of personality that soars triumphantly over all obstacles .
neither the old woman nor the two little black slave girls had noticed her .
what had she expected him to say , he wondered ?
he , too , turned and twisted at the handle .
he asked for a room from the _num_ th to the _num_ st .
she threw the words at him scornfully .
poirot moved towards the door .
he is unsuitable , said chief-inspector davy .
everyone kowtowing to herand then her singling out a poor chump like me .
argyle had been killed .
well , perhaps he wasnt .
the one thing i could do was to get hold of a timetable and see what time guy pagetts train would pass through kimberley .
id like to know what this is all about .
about two and a half years , that is all , said mr .
there was an atmosphere here .
could he still escape ?
i dont see it .
swettenham decidedly .
coddled by his mother .
his mind circled round the thought of theodora darrells husband .
but where poisons are concerned the impossible does happen .
cunning old dog .
few spaniards have blue eyes , have they , seorita ?
monsieur tony would immediately try to get down on all fours and slide under the sofa , since he had a poor opinion of the weekly bath .
we want to know whos supplying the stuff and where its coming from .
remembershe is really little more than a child .
poor old things , they get very muddled up sometimes , especially over time .
you make me see thingsthings that i ought to have seen all alongthat i actually have seenbut without knowing that i saw them .
he did not look at the girl , but he was aware , since his ears were functioning at full attention , of a quick little gasp she gave .
insufficient evidence ?
what you are asking me for is my private opinion ?
were publishing a description of her to the press and were roping in the b .
ive always been quite sure captain paton was innocent .
the franklins presented a most agreeable prospect to our norton .
i lose an hour of timetwo hoursand i cant remember .
her breath was coming in great gasps , her face was the colour of chalk .
this time haydock and appledore came in together .
anyway , its nothing to do with that , that i want to talk to you about , but at least i feel that i can speak frankly to you , that i can trust you not to repeat what i am now saying , though its possible that it all may have to come out later .
it had an entity of its own , and a capital letter .
it is not always good in hot weather , the veal and ham pie .
my dear , i wonder if i ever told you about the naval ball at portsmouth ?
but they are always doubtful of themselves .
and whos the most likely person to do that ?
that is why i used the term incredible .
victoria returned to earth to hear her employer , whom she had already diagnosed as a nonstop talker , concluding a series of remarks by saying : and nothing really clean if you know what i mean .
you cant be sure .
hugh chandler went on .
i do not watch at mr .
persia is my speciality .
most people are quite satisfied with arranging themselves tidily in the gas oven or measuring themselves out an enormous number of sleeping pills .
a few minutes later hercule poirot , exquisitely attired , and swinging a cane with a jaunty air , entered the room .
good type , spence .
on the other hand the exertion of moving might be too much for me .
i can see that , said tommy .
unlike me , she never read fairy stories as a child .
she was thereall huddled upandand coldhorribly cold .
i know him well enoughseen him in his fathers office in new yorkbut thats not to say hell remember me from a crowd of other operatives .
up to a point , said michael .
she thought her mistress had gone to bed .
most of that august they spent in the country at little priors .
perhaps ive really gone gaga and perhaps youre just humouring me , is that it ?
if he was going to take the matter that way , it was no good arguing with him .
its a queer do , said cherry .
just feel it .
philip stared .
after all , its only a game !
still , ill have to be polite .
reading aloud started with sir walter scott .
this your pub ?
i see , said hardcastle .
your plan has miscarried .
they sat one each side of her last nightglowering at each other !
proposing what ?
mon dieu , if only we may be in time .
its extraordinary how things seem to straighten themselves out when you talk a thing over .
weston thought to himself : rotten businessquestioning a child about her father .
we shall arrive at the dance a bit late , she said , but nobody notices , i findive often done it .
which was exactly what it had been , poirot reflected !
his car had been seen in the neighbourhood .
nothing is settled , he said .
did she dislike her sister ?
shes used to waiting on invalids , she says , and understands them .
of us all , the only person likely to make such a recognition was thora grey .
and with bella unsuspected , and jack renauld acquitted , all would end satisfactorily .
it would be less intimate .
was it interesting ?
take him into your confidence .
someone properly qualified to have access to drugs whenever she needed them .
i dont mind answering them .
a taxi came along the road .
and please dont come in and disturb me for at least three-quarters of an hour .
gardener agrees with me , that were only too anxious to do anything to help the british police in every way .
tommy turned from the washbasin drying his hands .
sorry to hear of the unfortunate accident during the course of your journey , but im glad it was no worse .
the new york times : a joy to read from beginning to end , especially in its acute sensitivity to the contrasts between this era and that of miss marples youth .
what madness possessed her !
it was a strange facepale , transparent looking , with enormous eyes .
does that fact suggest anything to you ?
i beg your pardon , sir , he said to his employer , but dr graham is here , and would like to see you .
was that the last time you had seen him ?
i dont knowi suppose he knew , or guessed , that he hadnt very long to live and wanted to be reconciledbut i really dont know .
jimmy sat on the edge of his bed listening for a minute .
twenty-two im sorry , olive .
we walked , maybe , for half an hour .
linnets maid entered the room .
poirot cried : yes , but what appeal is there ?
not arrested , chief-inspector davy corrected her .
the same thing applies to the fellow on rosemarys left .
how unusual ?
morley was preparing the filling , conversation was resumed .
i see , he said again .
yes , of course , said miss marple .
you carry on , doctor !
theyre goinghad enough of it .
didnt know no better then , said cyril .
a car , with a man bending over the open bonnet .
he said to himself approvingly : yes , a greek goda young shepherd in arcady .
i will come up at once .
lydia threw her a grateful glance .
he speculated .
it is a fairly fresh grease spot .
we travelled together to london .
entwhistles eyes went on from george crossfield .
no , said tommy , she isnt at home and i dont know either whether she is all right or not .
but you cant possibly remember them all , can you ?
very dangerous , all this speeding , put in the professor .
poirot bowed to him politely , and carelli returned his bow somewhat more ironically before making his exit .
thats right , said the old lady .
there wasnt any such thing .
' yes , it was her day out .
whats all this , ma ?
but if he was william bosner , then he was certainly a most accomplished actor !
whos come into the house ?
oh , no , not here !
he listened with satisfaction to the flow of remarks from the other end .
she ran with us .
its the only clue ive got , said tuppence .
you did not accompany them ?
it was as though what poirot had just said aroused her interest .
she didnt tell me she had .
it happened just before dinner , didnt it ?
my grandmother was now living with us .
carter turned his gaze this way and that about the room .
the cocks and hens and pots of flowers on their black background filled everybody with admiration and envy .
colonel easterbrook ?
i am not the dog one sets on to hunt and then recalls because you do not like the game he puts up !
faiths homelet her in and greeted her with a beaming face .
is that exactly how it was ?
i was quite sure that anne protheroe had had no pistol with her since miss marple had said so .
treves knew better .
in turkey somewhere .
it was some kind of a brawlthere had been some unforgivable insulti dont knowbut it was just a thing that had happened quite naturally .
narracott smiled , then again mentioning that evans was to wait , he proceeded on his tour of inspection .
therefore , the task , whatever it must be , could not be attacked from there .
he asks his pilot and school friend , bob rawlinson , to care for a packet of jewels .
he made a vague gesture with his hand .
you can sit down .
he said helpfully , my manservant told me that you wanted to consult me because you thought you might have committed a murder .
it is brave , he is a brave man .
brunskill .
the man might have been asking him the time .
i thought it splendid of her .
meant to attend the funeral , but had a little engine trouble on the way .
young girls killed .
i , hercule poirot , tell you so .
youll get that from your father , she said .
miss bulstrodes eyebrows rose in patient surprise .
like to very much .
otherwise he might have replied , at the fifth attempt , perhaps , and not always then !
that you can tell me when you have seen her .
does it cause the face to flush ?
i did , he said .
slowlyslowlywider and wider .
i cant believe it , she gasped .
such a hot afternoon , she observed graciously .
she was very enthusiastic and several of the ideas were hersabout changing clothes and all that .
eyes a sort of blue-grey .
not the middle light , only the desk light .
the pengelleys house stood a little way back from the road with an old-fashioned cottage garden in front .
charrington before seeking repose .
it was quite customary for wives to say joyfully to husbands , it will be all right .
now , with the same curious feeling of duality to which she was accustomed , she listened to mrs .
but major blunt was under the impression that it was you to whom mr .
and yet you said at the inquest that you had never seen the woman before ?
' ' she and mrs allen got on well together ?
you are quite different .
as you say , as you say , said poirot .
there are circumstances , or have been circumstances , in celias life that have prejudiced his mother against his early marriage to this particular girl .
professors and people often came down from town to see him .
of course , as mrs .
the doctor acted as though his suggestion were the most natural one in the world .
patrick , acting as host , has gone for the drinks .
you must remember my advanced age .
and he drew back so that challenger could see the little figure on the sofa .
you havent caught the idea yet .
she added apologetically , you see its all so new to me .
dear carrie louise , said miss marple .
she was quite all right .
it looked worried and abstracted .
the bon voyageur is a little-known hostelry .
nothing at all as far as we know .
he got me to tell him all about the little paddocks business .
seven the secretary we had not seen the last of japp .
all the old exhibits in their place , i see , he remarked .
that shows some sense .
yes , are you ?
the next day we went on again .
' turning off the main road , the two men passed into the comparative quiet of a mews .
and you said you hadnt .
in another minute he was out in the street , gaining fresh insight into the difficult art of shadowing .
poirot , to refuse the commission you have been offered .
police , arent you ?
then she wiped her eyes and took out her powder compact , struggling to regain command of herself .
then i got stuck in egypt till the armistice happened , kicked my heels there some time longer , and , as i told you , finally got demobbed .
shes engaged to him !
it was apprehension .
she looked inquiringly from cedric to the inspector .
the door was lockedyes .
in the hall below a magnificent hall porter had relegated albert to the background .
he turned his attention to the open french window , and the doctor continued : it is through here that mademoiselle saintclair fled .
it was as though someone had been making a hurried and ineffectual search for something .
and it was meeting him at greenshore that probably put the idea of an atomic scientist in to your head .
the wastepaper basket would have been much less dramatic , i agreed .
as a writer , stylptitch is an insufferable bore .
the old man was in good spirits thena bit tired , perhaps .
my attention was naturally on my friend , but i was conscious of an impression of dark hair , an impish face and big dark-blue eyes .
it was , she presumed , a hired car .
is that a likely thing to happen ?
one quick look he cast at the car from which the other had just alighted .
asked the policeman .
reggie carrington was twenty-one , and completely uninter-ested in housing , infant welfare , and indeed any political _num_ subject .
and theres nothing elsenothing connected with the sports pavilion , for instance , that you havent told me ?
my father was quite right about him .
ive fixed that good and square .
why , what on earth ?
you should see lewis serrocolds eyes sparkle behind those thick glasses of his .
treves last night .
couldnt have been her right name if she was german , said tuppence , and she was said to be a german spy or something like that , but she could have been english , i suppose .
cant remember what the prime minister sighed .
temple transferred her superior gaze to poirot .
would you agree to that ?
he said , whats that you say ?
i can explain , i really can .
the monosyllable came quietly and evenly .
but hilary still stared .
then , well-trained servant though he was , a look of complete astonishment flashed over his impassive face .
but remember he never mentioned that incident to anyone .
he was preparing the wayfor what ?
really , she had told old george again and again that she only wanted sulphur-coloured antirrhinums , not that rather ugly purple shade that gardeners always seemed so fond of .
probably break up about your ears .
well , but thats all right , isnt it ?
it was brought in by the seedy-looking manservant .
ive been congratulating myself ever since i sold it .
she must have been joking .
yes , i heard .
raymond west was no exception .
then , it has gone .
i am , you understand , somewhat old-fashioned .
oh , wax figures are right out , said mrs .
oh yes , sir .
he wondered about the people who lived in quarry house now .
waring has , said mrs .
julia leaned back and gasped .
colonel race took rapid charge of the situation .
so it seems , said sir james dryly .
were very grateful for all youve told us .
just when we were all so happy and enjoying everything so much .
the articles in it were expensive but not ultra expensive .
poirot leaned towards mrs .
we all see pictures of ourselvesof ourselves as we want to be .
at last she heard only a far-off howling noise which she took to be jackals , and the intermittent bursts of dog barking which she knew would continue through the night .
then i offered my sister a piece of advice .
your daughters a very enthusiastic scientific worker .
you will be glad to hear , hastings , that we have finished with market basing splendid .
that is his explanation .
were they turning nasty ?
im not blaming you , girl , im not blaming you .
why should i tell you where i was , and what i was doing ?
weve been hunting for days .
i know very little , i said .
do you always do what you like , miss beddingfeld ?
her intelligent grey eyes met his .
i had got out of the train to do what the english call stretch the legs at the station of konya .
was the dagger in its place when you were looking over the contents ?
it would resemble more or less the popping of the fireworks and blend in very well with the noise of them .
you are a spyi always knew it .
presently she was aware of someone standing by her side .
a few days later there was a report in the papers of the death of mrs .
in some ways it resembles , does it not , a novelette of older days ?
simone , her eyes still closed , drew a deep breath .
a little plain soda water thenno whisky .
any reason given ?
this desks full of old diaries of his .
all in all , hes a downy card .
it went on and on and on .
have some coffee .
curry shook his head .
after it was concluded , detective-inspector frank cornish joined arthur badcock .
ackroyd that ralph was staying at the three boars .
then , henry came home .
about once or twice a week i was in the habit of purchasing two ounces of john cotton mild .
he led him across the hall and through a door on the right closing it behind him .
but he never does .
hortonand she thought the nurses were poisoning her !
my fees , he said softly , are very expensive .
both auntie-grannie and granny b .
if we ever wanted it .
anthea bradbury-scottthe one with the big parcel .
tucker promptly .
of course it was just fun naturally , said egg .
oh , albert , albert .
an old dented silver-backed mirror .
he paused for a moment and then added : he lived to be quite an old man , i believe .
jeremy warrender , an attractive young man in his twenties , was wearing a raincoat over his suit .
after dr .
lets get out of this .
nevertheless , to quiet public opinion an exhumation order was granted .
well , mon ami , he said .
oh yes , said canon pennyfather .
if only he could act the part of the credulous thick-headed englishman well enough .
she found the girls bewilderment pitiful .
an idea struck me .
i thought peg said it was open .
though having no particular liking for the bouncing , self-opinionated gladys , she was quite sure of the girls intrinsic honesty and could well imagine that the affair must have upset her .
odd business , wasnt it ?
lady westholme is exactly fitted to the life she leads and is completely happy and successful .
oh , jennifer wouldnt do that sort of thing , said mrs .
during the month of september that we stayed in dinard my father was happy to find some old friends theremartin pirie and his wife and two sons , who were finishing off their holidays .
the two men went out together , and hailing a taxi they drove to campden hill .
we will protect you .
bundledarling bill caught her to him .
it drove me half crazy to see him getting away and me not able to move or do anything at all .
its awfully exciting , isnt it ?
aa simple restorative stammered roberts .
old geordie he fell over the edge there one night and broke his neck .
i had a mind to study the scene of the crime myself .
she complained that the nurses were poisoning her .
larkin always fussing , i dont wonder at that , either .
no , but i deny your right to criticize my actions .
she had quite a reputation for witchcraft there .
she began to wonder about mr .
but how did you buy it ?
its just somebodys idea of humour , but i wish i knew whose .
lucy was right , he said .
its very short notice .
he had gauged his father-in-law correctly .
i dont know whether youve realized it , monsieur poirot ?
i seldom sleep on these night journeys , and the book i have with me is a very dull one .
but look here , dick , when i came to number _num_ , wilbraham crescent just petered out .
from there inspector raglan took me along the path which leads to the drive .
what did major rich seem to you like on that fatal evening ?
allowing that my theory of the crime was the correct one , and i believe that it must be the correct one , then obviously the wagon lit conductor himself must be privy to the plot .
he just dropped me and went on into drymouth .
thereupon he went down to the shore to meet his brother .

virginia followed him with a cushion under her arm .
whats come over you ?
a good modern product .
something about major palgrave something that if she could only remember twenty-three the last day i and the evening and the morning were the last day , said miss marple to herself .
they were just passing it .
she said , turning to father .
anything in the nature of clothes can be very easily dispatched to charities .
how clever of you .
to herself , emily arundell admitted what she would never have admitted to another human being , her dissatisfaction with the younger generation of her family .
theyd taken off the crust and theyd taken out the veal and am what was inside it , and what dyou think they put in instead ?
george lee cried : but thats absurd !
and yet a queer feeling passed over her .
rathbone and that searching dark glance of his .
charles , she said .
youre not going to prosecute him for blackmail ?
but very quietly hercule poirot took command .
the backs not really broken .
so sure that she might , occasionally , make a mistake .
there was a big dark man with her , american .
voices doubtful , indignant , excited .
i had to ask .
a great deal , i think .
browne (ill still call you that , if you dont mind) , i want to say that im very much obliged to you for the prompt way you brought miss marle along this evening to tell that story of hers .
and she died .
the three women huddled round it .
latimer then .
in the files at scotland yard he looked hopefully at the inspector .
there are not very many phosphorescent substances .
clarissa began to speak seriously and with emphasis .
no ; on the contrary i know nothing at all .
and , though half an hour earlier this had been precisely my own view , i did not enjoy having the tables turned upon me .
her eyes watched the back of her husbands head .
it was feeling , said miss marple .
i turned in an explanatory way to ellie .
miss marple told him .
for a moment she could hardly find her voice .
you smoke , you saya pipe , cigarettes , cigars ?
it almost touched my bound hands .
eh bien , you realize the position ?
and alistair had murmured vaguely something about it being expected of you in the countrycant let the parson down , you knowwhich typically english sentiment had merely bewildered the young man , and had made hercule poirot smile comprehendingly .
could you say , just for once , that you love me madly ?
poirot handed her amelia barrowbys letter .
shut up , said cliff bent .
i must confess i have always had a distaste for him .
he was charged and stood his trial .
she looked down at the two small boys engrossed with the clay and then to where ankh was rolling about chanting to herself and waving her little legs .
the voice of a well-bred young englishman spoke .
just then , felicie bault came out with a tray .
turned her down flat .
just my luck that i never came here before .
you see , bella and her husband were down the weekend beforefussing over aunt emily because of her accident .
the emperor of peru ?
i rather think she belonged there unless im confusing her with some other girl .
we walked down the steps and across a short stretch of grass to the sea .
' general barnes looked after her with a concerned expression , shaking his head gently .
ackroyd , miss flora ackroyd , major blunt , mr .
she had entered mary bartons employment only a few months before .
finally , the doctor stood upright and shook his head .
she wondered if she could come and see you this evening , sir , after dinner .
hautet was interruptedto his intense annoyance .
but she didnt get there .
havent you seen trains in collision on the screen ?
ii they came into the room and paused at the doorway .
its that quality of yours that made me love you , i believe .
died this evening about half an hour ago .
as to the sleeping powders , i knew by this .
anything about her ?
married a perfectly decent respectable girl .
what was yesterday evening ?
she left no letter or word of any kind ?
one of those four people must have been approached or communicated with in some way .
the coffeemy god !
they drove through a park and up to the house .
but it would be some time yet .
no confusion .
peter lord said heavily : you havent got hold of anything ?
it does not explain her fit of weeping over the letter .
he nodded his head gently : all converging towards a given spotand then , when the time comesover the top !
there were portly foreigners , opulent jewesses , a sprinkling of the really smart , and several ladies belonging to the oldest profession in the world .
mr bernard parker was at home .
lets get back to the important part .
but we have outwitted him !
i commented on the fact .
the word exploded like a bomb .
it tortured him !
today is enough to live throughand i swear to you you are not in danger today .
she added , looking round her brightly .
he did not go very far but his progress was leisurely .
what is the troublewith her family , i mean ?
i neednt say it all .
une dompteuse , said dr gerard to himself .
mr costello comes here , he began slowly , and returns the articles which the first mrs hailsham-brown had taken from your husband by mistake .
its most peculiar she frowned over the letter .
not , perhaps , a conscious fear , but some vague maternal instinct .
thats all we need for the present .
the market basing mystery i after all , theres nothing like the country , is there ?
yes , clarissa remembered .
it was all over now .
came reeling out with his times and his alibis .
and one must respect the psychology .
the famous bazaar had taken place on saturday , and an entertainment , in connection with the same charity , at which mrs .
it isnt just curiosity , said miss marple .
shall we fix the day after that for the ceremonythe placing of the inscribed bowl in the offering chamber of the tomb ?
hed go and find work for himself .
ah , poirot sat up .
her lips were dry and rough .
a nice lad , too , not too many brains but a really nice boy .
nurse hopkins sat silent a minute or two , frowning , then abruptly she rose , went across the room , opened a drawer and took out an envelope .
you went straight up from the drawing room to your bedroom and remained there until the morning ?
she spoke quickly and her breath came fast .
they belonged , three months ago , to his highness prince ali yusuf of ramat .
he said to the dragon : i would like to see the mother superior .
different people , said mrs .
you say that mr .
its make-believe .
it was unnecessaryalmost gauche .
he did not answer , and something in the quality of his silence struck me as peculiar .
you mean , she said , that manthe fatherthe child that was run over ?
general , i think it was you who sat across the aisle from captain smethurst .
philip garrod was turned out of the house with scant ceremony ; but as a result of his rage clodes own health took a decided turn for the worse .
spenlow has fallen asleep .
she turned her head to include another middle-aged lady .
tommy bent over and looked where tuppences small finger pointed to a portion of the verse in question .
as many lives as cats , these young fellows .
george , rosemary and iris all called her ruth and she often came to elvaston square to lunch .
hubbard turned gratefully to poirot .
young lady , frances cary , the second girl , has been there some time .
after all , she had got a grudge against him .
lee , that there was a kind of family meeting held in your fathers room this afternoon ?
one says things so often without even seeing what they really mean .
it was perhaps natural that the air marshal would find his right-hand neighbour the pleasanter to talk to .
where did the box come in ?
major bletchley .
one of our captains of industry .
i found it quite inconceivable at this point to enter into the mind of the murderer .
she must be going batty , poor thing .
well , edna here saw her .
he was treated like a dedicated dalai lama .
she spoke very positively .
pearson talked english of the strangest .
you lawyers !
doctors ought to be careful what they tell a chap .
she was all incoherent delight and pleasure at seeing sir henry , and became quite flustered when introduced to the chief constable and detective-inspector craddock .
alfred lee live here .
rudd .
she slipped the ring off her finger and held it out to him .
i always knew something bad would happen in this house , some day .
she uttered a piercing cry , and before anyone could get to her , swayed , and fell heavily .
its a dream ive been having .
i didnt suppose you meant bakers shops with french rolls in them , though , come to think of it , theres no reason why not .
she said apologetically : im afraid its in a rather disgusting state .
he had decided , however , that it could not possibly have travelled so far .
he said : will you come this way , please .
hope this wont be a bad attack .
monsieur is very kind .
she brought it down with her every morning , and took it up every night .
i guess even you get kinder muddled now and then .
i fully believe that roger intends to make settlements upon dear flora , but , as you know , he is just a leetle peculiar about money .
berries or leaves .
he must start again from the bottom .
she turned away , fumbled in her bag , and a small lace-edged handkerchief was pressed for a moment to her eyes .
parker pyne was goaded to inquire how expensive .
before i had time to speak , mrs .
you say we are not discussing murderers , said poirot .
you could find the reason very easily if you examine your state of mind honestly .
irritating women .
oh no , sir , they just dont think youre serious .
therefore he pretended to have lost interest .
hercule poirot ?
shut the door , cant you , johnnie ?
it will only be adjourned .
why should i give er to you ?
it was almost the same colour as the wood , a pale brownish colour .
she gave him a hard stare .
amongst other women ?
slowly she went out of the room .
one : the police are perfectly aware that edward seton was guilty .
her two daughters followed , bringing in the rest of the provisions .
he took lauras cigarette from the ashtray , then went to the table by the wheelchair and took his own stub from the ashtray .
if you will look at the name of robinson in the telephone directory , you will realize that a fair-haired mrs .
that looks bad .
but you wont have any real idea from their accounts .
she nodded her head several times .
the first thing is to get you out of the way .
in any case , said lord kidderminster , sandra will not be charged unless there is an absolutely convincing case against her .
leidner looked distressed .
shirtsleeves to swivel-chair in three generations had certainly come true in our family .
the actor made a careless gesture .
orders from the ruddy foreign office .
sardine sandwiches as well as the tomato ones .
suddenly he sighed and opened his eyes .
her view seemed to be that the whole thing was a fad of her masters and quite unnecessary .
i should not be believed .
the girl with the anxious eyes !
would it not be better to take monsieur renauld to the shed ?
he hardly knew what it was that had made him choose to spend his last few days of leisure where he now was .
true , he had seen the maid just for a moment when she handed him the tickets , but his impression had been merely that of a gaunt , black-clad female .
my father-in-law is very fond of young people and likes to have them round him .
mary came and sat in the chair elinor indicated .
he smiled , unclosing his hand so that i should see what lay in the palm of it .
he was caught in our house .
of the secret causes actuating that strike .
she took the paper and pencil he gave her and wrote down the name and address as requested .
nobody wanted it or anything .
you have an appointment with mr .
wu ling , and afterwards went out with him .
but what could be more natural ?
he did ask someone to come and see him immediately after dinner .
the thieves nearly got away with them , but thanks to this young ladyhe indicated lorainethey didnt .
the only thing that worries me , said mrs .
probably call yourself a middle man .
she was deafer than ever !
shes the worst cat in the village , said griselda .
youre too unworldly , mr .
usually not , i think .
why did ann shapland also choose a sandbag to kill mademoiselle blanche ?
there were only four at our table .
she said suddenly : what about dr .
yes , perhapsmad , poor creaturethe murderer , i mean .
this particular tour , mr .
it is very much as i had imagined .
what is past is past and cannot be undone .
but when a man is really in love he cant help looking like a sheep .
the peterfield business ?
looking at me with his dogs eyes .
the disgraceful way you behaved .
letter written to m .
thank ra in his mercy that here is a death unaided by man or by evil spirit .
it makes it very difficult .
why does one do anything ?
now go to the front door , open it , also no tricks about it .
a crowd gathered magically , with a couple of policemen and the bus driver as its nucleus .
you and i were children at the time .
mr simpson said he couldnt say , he was sure .
what has that to do with me ?
the severe woman led them upstairs and into a room on the first floor .
he told the driver of the car that he would not be longa quarter of an hour at mostand then he sought audience with miss emlyn .
hercule poirot said : never mind what i mean .
i know a good deal about you !
' japp came towards her .
all the jauntiness went out of his bearing .
however , they examined the old boy , decided he was only knocked out , and would probably come round later and they went on with their plans .
its my day off and im goin off , thats what he says .
im continually having to speak to her about something or other .
talking volubly about her sensations when crossing on a plank bridge mrs .
youre very fond of her , arent you ?
bosom ?
you cant concentrate on that only .
im going to stay herein the open .
renisenb spoke with sceptical intonation .
hemming , about anything you please , said mrs .
i dont know as id have liked to go into that house , said mrs .
youre such a good organizer and such a hard worker .
heavy , numbing sleep .
struck down all in a moment .
but he did care .
then a builder got hold of it , and modernized it with great success , selling it to a city gentleman who used it for weekends .
the sails ?
ive a feeling theres something wrong about that man , the inspector continued thoughtfully .
he plans the whole mise en scne .
nurse hopkins uprose in wrath .
i want to know who tommy is .
lord whitfield said gently : my dear young man , you dont know who it is youre talking to .
his leap took him safely on to the pavement .
he is here ?
then he spoke : dr .
the man at the desk nodded thoughtfully .
a well-known horse , eh ?
how long were you at yewtree lodge on this occasion ?
sitting on one with her head twisted round .
i would have joined her , but she came out into the passage , shut the door behind her , and taking my arm led me into the drawing room , which was empty .
but what is it you want to know about mr .
he could not have killed louise bourget .
man-mad , thats what they are !
you sit down here .
but oh !
plenty of jobs for me .
that is , i think , about seven miles from here , madame ?
and when i met her she resumed , i should have known then .
there are only two houses of any importance in kings abbot .
iii i ran into miss emily barton outside .
orourke , who had been reclining in an immense armchair , began at once to talk with great animation to loraine , who was listening with half an ear to bundles highly technical explanation of the mechanical trouble which had affected the hispano .
well , every man to his taste .
at styles .
and as i passed here , i thought it would be so lovely to be alone herein the dark and the moon .
cralenot mrs .
when we arrived on the platform the first person we saw was inspector crome .
during the purchase , she entered into amicable conversation with mrs .
we havent called in scotland yard yet , miss murgatroyd .
darling arlena , god , i feel blue .
she grabbed the coin from me , and said : give me your hand then .
and he only had a small bottle of tablets at a time .
but i cant talk here .
two people had a motive in seeing that this should not happen .
inspector craddock , how very nice to see you .
he broke her heart .
he scraped a little more away round the thigh bone .
no one will do you any harm .
' ' did you also know her husband ?
but you cant think of anyone it would be likely to be ?
just what everybody else eats and drinks .
in a minute or two he heard a voice close behind him .
repression !
extraordinary , he said bitterly , the places people put things !
boots .
theres a man on the floor dead she was going to step on him .
there was a whole batch of his paintings sold from one of his exhibitions .
as a public figure she stood for the old-fashioned values of family life , welfare work amongst women , and was an ardent supporter of the league of nations .
well , well see , well see , said cowan .
yet , when the conductor came in answer to his bell last night , it was a voice speaking in french that told him that it was a mistake and that he was not wanted .
cresswell , what is it ?
nothing ; but but what ?
i will type out the names and addresses of my various employers and give them , with a copy of my references to sergeanthay , is it ?
the crime had been planned between them .
then they make inquiries about randall goedlers widow .
her glance swept round the company .
hes illegitimate , as youve probably guessed , poor lad , and of very humble beginnings .
i wont sleep a wink if there is water dripping on my face .
she might have been since they were the same age , but no , i think she was in some entirely different place in england .
of course , inspector mcneil got on to the telephone immediately .
i find it very helpful .
now listen , m .
mademoiselle , you should not be intimidatedyou should be thrilled !
but to somebody else ?
george received these remarks in his usual wooden fashion .
he came and sat down by the table and looked up at mr .
with a word of apology the chief constable left the room .
i fear so .
oh , dear , that must have been mrs clements little boy .
there were just two words .
sir oswald drew in his breath with a long , satisfied hiss .
well , of course itsi dont suppose its anything to do with this , but i thought i might just mention it to you , sir please do .
babbington bowed her head .
and she has managed somehow to be at medenham wells , instead of peacefully at home in st .
megan was a disharmonious element in his house .
mademoiselle maricot was a brunette dyed blonde , with a plain but excitingly made-up face .
and whose ?
i am a police officer , and i have a warrant to search this house .
still sobbing hysterically , pippa tried to turn away from her .
you didnt know him very well ?
new and shoddy , was how inspector narracott described it to himself .
i can , laura assured him .
but her instinct was quite right .
nurse hopkins said sharply : of course you have .
ah dont know nothing but what ahve told you .
there were sweetpeas in flower .
it looks , does it not , as if someone wanted to be sure of her presence there before proceeding towhat ?
she had probably heard too many ribald comments on brilliant young men who live with and upon elderly women .
lancaster looked up wildly .
but the woman was the hysterical , emotional kind who likes to make a scene , and either the husband got wind of what was going on , or his wife confessed .
raymond half stopped , flushed , shied like a nervous horse and his eyes went apprehensively to the centre of his family group .
here then was my first ray of light .
before she replied to his question there was something that she herself had to know .
ive got the warrant .
presently a bell rang with violence on alberts desk .
there was no wasp that i know of , said mitchell .
he would have to be domiciled in exhampton .
it makes me quite frightened sometimes .
but tonight there was a messagefor e .
poirot followed him , look 	he led the way .
bassington-ffrench frankie lost no time in setting to work .
was it the necessity of leaving on each body a copy of an a b c railway guide ?
the case against leonard vole was black beyond words .
lydia said slowly : after theadventurous life he has led .
always employ the expertthat has been my motto .
i met miss stanwell in the lane , he said conversationally .
i said : you thinkthat she was murdered ?
mind you , there were nice people among them .
quimper smiled .
he ended by trying to do away with anyone who annoyed him in the slightest degree .
i will tell you how i set about it .
miss gorringe explained .
its somebody very clever and very careful , she said .
they all fuss about me so , she said .
and so far he hasnt slipped up in any way ?
box _num_ ) pymble , nsw _num_ , australia www .
recognize sonia ?
i do realize that now .
and though i say it myself , im well qualified .
did you mean now ?
it was being a doctor , she supposed , that made him understand .
he is quite sure of the truthhe , alexander bonaparte cust , is a homicidal lunatic .
yes , sir , said parsons , we gathered as much .
his voice , when he spoke , sounded differentit had a curious sort of humility in it .
im feeling tired .
harold said quickly : you look all in , mrs .
cornelia paused breathless .
truth to tell , i was always just a teeny weeny bit afraid of her !
in fact , i think she would have found some way of stopping it .
i do not wholly approve of her works , mind you .
' that ' s the kind mrs alien smoked - gaspers .
were you at any time acquainted with a family of the name of armstronga family in which a tragedy occurred ?
opinionated , pestilential , muddleheaded old fool .
somehow iris got the impression that the unknown man had been very determined to break with rosemary finally .
you havent an awful lot of experience of the strangling kind , have you , gwenda ?
may i ask what exactly passed between you ?
he really looks to me quite like a gangster .
together the two men discussed business matters , prevailing prices , and the profits resulting from crops , cattle , and timber .
that was about all .
be careful , tuppence , this craving for vulgar sensation alarms me .
what do you think , colonel ?
that man , for instance , who had just passed her .
of course you want some tea .
as she merely looked interested he went on : and there was the pinstripe suit .
he turned his head sharply towards her .
she was standing in the middle of the roof staring straight in front of her , and there was the most awful look on her face .
she talked a good deal .
there are times , said john christow , when terry seems to me almost humannot like zena !
i cant remember i think she was just nervous .
satin stripe , you know , not moir .
probably only the good god knows !
do you mean to say that im wrong ?
jefferson , you see , whom hed always depended upon a lot for sympathy , had changed a good deal this summer .
costello might have decided to come back and warn mrs hailsham-brown about the man , and elgin assaulted him .
ryder , and it was clear at once that mr .
he himself thought , definitelya dead rat .
r plain unmarried friend " , and it ' s al/about- : 	you buy at the chemist ' s arid sl , a .
now i am twenty-four , i have a wife , i have big son , grown-up soni show you .
cest peut-tre le phlegme brittanique .
the worst of it is weve hardly got a case to go to the police on .
the snapshot was a snapshot of a woman ?
send me along ronnie first .
money can advertise , or money can keep secrets , can hush things up .
there seemed to be no loose books lying about with signs of having had interest shown in them .
drink it up , she said .
i was just dropping off when a sound wakened me .
nobody really would be any help .
stephen answered : shes easily the best thing to look at that ive seen since i came to england .
in the local evening echo .
poirot said reprovingly : one should always think of these things .
but no , i tell you .
that fluffy woolly thing that we dont know what its for from miss marple , and the lovely crown derby tea set from mr .
probably he counted on the room next door being empty since it was when he fixed the bolts .
at a table drawn up to a gas fire an old lady was sitting laying out a patience .
oh , tim , dont be ridiculous .
somewhat crippled .
he was little changed , still carefree and debonair as of old , with the same habit of treating all things lightly .
i was perfectly all right when i went to bed last nightat least of course it wasnt really last night .
it was something more definite , more alarming .
the guests arrived shortly afterwards .
did you ever hear or did it ever occur to you that mrs .
the desk was locked but one of the keys on her bunch fitted it .
i dont think i was thinking of anything at all .
i have so far strained the honour of an english gentleman as to travel to this country under an assumed name .
poirot said : she was called away owing to the illness of a relative , so your brother told me .
you are like the weeping lady with the silver ewer .
iii after our stay at thorpe arch , evelyn cochran asked me to come to see them in london .
but it is stupid to pretend .
starkwedder regarded mrs warwick thoughtfully .
that anonymous letters are usually written by women ?
in his head he continued to compose the polished period of the letter he had been dictating .
the mystery of the spanish chest i punctual to the moment , as always , hercule poirot entered the small room where miss lemon , his efficient secretary , awaited her instructions for the day .
i have my patient all ready for you , mr .
and one does feel that she could do better .
what did you say to her ?
and what are you going to do for yourself ?
yet , whether gas or dead mouse , something continued to smell .
of course hes rolling in money , and , as i say , hes done up the house in a wonderful wayit was an absolute ruin , falling to pieces .
and hes so light-hearted too , i cant tell you what fun we used to havehe and richard carey and ithe first years we were out here .
are you warning me off , sir ?
argyle , that you must feel exceedingly bitter about the whole business .
in short , was that word an accusation ?
then i was recalled to this country .
dacre , the wife of captain denis dacre , was unfortunately drowned at landeer cove , just a little farther along the coast .
q-u-i-n .
i dont know what he said to hershe was a credulous girl , as i said just now .
but , i added .
by the middle of june .
miss marple came to herself with a little start .
and the things hes done to it must have cost him a fortune .
dakin and paid by mr .
yes , said tuppence , yes .
i did my best to be as cordial as possible to her during the short time she stayed on the island .
somebody else told me about it .
their possessions are unpacked for them when they arrive and such a thing would have been seen and noted , and would , i may say , have aroused considerable comment .
oh , no sir , nothing of the kind .
did you get the netting ?
he clutched at the folds of his overcoat on the left side .
we can come back later , he said .
among his chemical formulae was a list of people in the factory to be approached , as possible fascist sympathisers .
she was terrible , this woman !
jimmy allenson looked up quickly .
it might be anybody .
youre so sympathetic .
sarah and raymond did not draw apart .
the search did not take log .
he pursued his way through a rose garden , where the neat layout of the beds delighted himand through the winding ways of an alpine rock garden , coming at last to the walled kitchen gardens .
both he and mr .
not nowadays !
the first one miss marple read while sipping her early morning tea , that is , if it was delivered in time .
after some lecturing with site and some from me , two days later she announced that she would go to the dentist .
you see , dolly , said colonel bantry .
as starkwedder entered the room , sergeant cadwallader went out into the hall to deal with the constable .
and those wild shotseach of them half a mile out !
poirot read the name out .
he had heard it somewhere .
every man has his weak spot .
there must be some place in the room where it could be hidden .
i shook my head , puzzledand yet that particular shade of pink paper was very familiar .
only cares about saving .
but shes been very lucky that its no worse .
if there is someone unhinged round here , i dont want you to be the one who stops the bullet or drinks the henbane .
hardly the word .
dont you , my dear ?
one other thing , monsieur poirot , he said , in his suave mocking voice .
perhaps , you know , when we havent got anything else to do and our backs are aching because of planting tulip bulbs , we might have a little sort of look round .
that events come to peoplenot people to events .
i shook my head helplessly .
you cant enjoy yourself quietly .
she sent me dozens of photographs .
there are , you know , several possibilities about mrs .
a suggestion , murmured poirot .
of course , after he had seen miss gilchrist .
jackson was on his knees before a suitcase .
she would go to her room and bathe her aching head and temples in cold water .
quite a charming childbut so nave , only twenty , you know , and he must be at least forty-five .
think .
it was mixed-upreal people and people who werent real .
three the man who grew vegetable marrows i told caroline at lunch that i should be dining at fernly .
one was fair and a littlejust a littletoo plump ; the other was dark and a littleagain just a littleinclined to scragginess .
people whom one wishes one could do a little something for but ones own funds do not admit of it .
nobody noticed that m .
no letters had been kept , no photographs .
how nice to see you , inspector grange !
from across the room sir george said : hattie .
but she only said it laughingly .
keeps a man fit .
women like to be mastered , but they hate not to have their sacrifices appreciated .
i did thinki admit itthat you were not realizing all the implications .
there were more sounds nowscufflingpantinga low gurgling cry .
you are thinking of your bachelor days , said tuppence pointedly .
prepare yourself .
she nodded her head slowly .
look here , im afraid im going to give you rather a shock .
hugo said slowly : oh , well , i shouldnt say that you have an idea ?
leverson come in ?
inspector neele said slowly : i dont think miss marple went on quickly : i expect youre about thirty-five or thirty-six , arent you , inspector neele ?
but not the interpretation of them .
well , i said , the funeral is tomorrow morning .
sir charles seemed suddenly to have aged .
oh , the usual things .
she stared at him suspiciously .
inspector slack has no sense of humour .
she cant touch the capitalexcept , i believe , for about a thousand pounds .
madresweetest thats enoughyou go and enjoy yourselves .
when i came home , she was quite kind .
v what shall i do to drive away remembrance from mine eyes ?
were her children fond of her ?
satipys voice rose .
the voice stopped .
to think that julius must have been actually under the same roof with her for a few hours .
the lady said id know by your moustache .
great impertinence , i call it !
it moved down and into their range of vision .
after all , these financial johnnies dont ask for intellectual companionship .
shes just a raw girl , remember ?
we must step very carefully .
to your house ?
she admitted it grudgingly .
davis , im not a policeman .
crematedaccording to his own request .
poirot was an extraordinary-looking little man .
poor alex , said mrs .
i told her shed better .
had you ever seen the deceased before ?
up to a point , yes , said miss marple .
every shelf and table was littered with miscellaneous articles .
did i not impress upon you that you were to eat nothing that came from outside ?
cloade poisoned herself by accident ?
i can , you know .
the police began mr .
he sat up in a startled fashion .
there , i think , was an incident that may have left a deep impression on him .
put this mrs .
weve got a slogan , she smiled .
he was not only foreign but ornately foreign .
you observe , hastings , she is shrewd beyond belief in the business sense , but she has absolutely no intellect .
a ruse de guerre , my friend , a ruse de guerre .
it coloured all her actions .
therefore , at the moment he was buttonholing lord caterham on the steps of the club on wednesday morning , he would have been greatly surprised to learn that the granarth castle had docked at southampton the preceding afternoon .
already footsteps are echoing along the gallery which connects the two wings .
little lily gamboll , tragic child product of our overcrowded age .
isnt it perfectly obvious who killed my brother ?
not so much looksas character .
when that remark was repeated to me , it became a confirmation of my theory .
you are quite definitely an author by this time .
it is not only crime that calls ?
henet the despised , the sycophantic , fawning henet .
she said it was important .
i have stepped off the drive .
was it indeed to this desolate spot that tuppence had been decoyed ?
the eyes slanted up at the corners like an orientals .
perhaps , she thought , closing her eyes altogether , i am in londonand the alarm clock will go off very soon , and i shall get up and go to mr .
ten days , i thought .
it would be an odd state of affairs if one were to take all they said au pied de la lettre .
clipp excitedly , you know that interesting looking man ?
it makes it a little difficult for us .
ii superintendent harper looked up consideringly at the faade of braeside as he rang the front door bell .
the magistrate frowned .
dont think so .
there were curtains of rose gauze and roses on the wallpaper and mrs .
it seems as though i remember something about it , he said , but its a long time ago .
youll waste your strength uselessly .
it was naomi .
we had a whole week , and we went to the new forest .
and very good reasons too , replied poirot .
you hadinformation ?
and morley ?
my wifes dead and cant defend herself .
it was as though he was looking at her from a long way away , taking in the square chin , the dark eyes , the resolute mouth .
at jennifers school .
he and colonel munro .
his death was a just retribution .
the answer rang true enough .
but he did like the thought of her money .
she intended to have a private talk with that person .
the real julia was all wet about this acting stuff and i soon persuaded her it was her duty to art to go and fix herself up in some uncomfortable lodgings in perth and train to be the new sarah bernhardt .
let me first ask you a question , said poirot as he seated himself .
' ' what man ?
parker withdrew .
the old life here , the life i was so pleased to come back to , has passed away .
all will march to a marvel .
anno dominianno domini .
that is what worries me .
oliver , as a matter of fact she had her usual somewhat shamefaced expression when she said this , that was habitual to heryes , i do write novels .
but he acknowledged that there was character there .
yes , he said , it is very like a wasp ; but it is not a wasp !
its quite well-known in the village , it seems , that thomas pollock , alfreds grandfather , was one of old mr .
there can be no pretending in this game .
but then i was disappointed .
ah , but you cant take risks with glass .
then what exactly is your little idea ?
you had better wait , though , until i have had a look round , said narracott , in case there might be any question i want to ask you .
we have started shooting the picture .
his eyelids flickered .
she was capable of hiding any secret , she would certainly let nothing escape her which she did not mean to let escape .
nowthe facts .
marcus looked surprised .
so is audrey , said lady tressilian .
and now we come to the second factthe chair pulled out from the wall .
and about the lost key and the duplicate ?
he went to iceland , he went to the american continent .
now , what are we to do ?
do you also deny this ?
quick , quick , to the flat in westminster .
not enough to live on without getting work of some kind .
i shall have the woman i love .
i suppose it would be .
nevile turned on him furiously .
on the inspectors face was perplexity , dr stillingfleet was frowning , cornworthy merely stared uncomprehendingly , mrs farley gazed in blank astonishment , joanna farley looked eager .
hes full of romantic notions just now .
she might say anything .
iii elinor went at last in search of roddy .
you told me to ask questions , and i have come to do so , said sir edward , smiling as he shook hands .
it is vaguely reminiscent , is it not , of mr .
it backs on other houses .
its emptiness served to emphasize the intimacy of tea drinking together .
not you either , deborah , if it comes to that .
he addressed himself to john : mr .
so naturally she was not uneasy .
a woman could do that .
i dont do anything myself these days .
you dont want to be steady .
vera had gone rather white .
hes good-looking in his way , but dull as ditch water .
je vous fais mes compliments .
as such , they had that mysterious thing , prestige ; they looked down with scorn on shop assistants and their like .
all along youve made it clear it was the truth you wanted .
one more question , mrs farley .
chapter five there was no doubt that poirots statement was unexpected .
well , of course , that settles it , i said stiffly .
she was therelying in a crumpled-up heap , her little white face turned up to the sky .
and most conveniently she leaves her handkerchief behind !
a liveried chauffeur was opening the door of a large cadillac .
(where did the old dear want to go ?
then he spluttered out : those damned clocks !
she clutched at his sleeve .
poirots precise voice cut in .
we-ll the manager seemed slightly taken aback .
the maid stared .
lying on his back by the swimming poolthe slow drip of blood over the edgethe feel of the revolver in her hand .
i mean you came here to nurse mr .
ancient history , i imagine .
he suspected something , though .
he loved us both , terry , and thats all that matters .
his eyes had opened rather wide .
oh , one always has ideas .
a friend of mine happened to mention them , said poirot .
he paused and then asked in a matter-of-fact voice : why did mr .
i expect you know my business here as well as i do , said poirot with a slight smile .
satisfactory data came to hand on the subject , however , through mr .
they have already quite enough money , mr .
carter about it , she added , and told him the gist of her letter .
what ive been through with crump .
one cant be too careful .
and i take off my hat to you .
this story of beatrices was the first intimation i had that such a state of affairs might exist .
all them nurses .
and now she made a helpless gesture with her handseverything is fear .
the ones that dont live in had gone home .
said some coffee she was given was poisoned .
hehe must have gone to fetch the police instead of telephoning .
all right , all right , but you know how difficult these things are .
i eyed her closely .
the people had short curved boards and came floating in on the waves .
and im not so sure it was a mans voice , either .
clarke , that it was your brothers habit to go for a stroll every evening ?
she made renisenb share her food and her winealthough she had no fear for renisenbyet .
she was very young for her age .
she sighed and said , elderly people can be very difficult sometimes .
familiar as i was with all the details , they thrilled me anew as i heard the bald recital of our adventures and escapes .
wed better go up and see .
its really all quite easy , clarissa assured them .
she was just going out into the corridor when she gave a sudden exclamation , and came back into her compartment with a gentleman .
kemps cup has coffee in it .
the big grey-haired man who drew a chair forward and sat down had his profession clearly stamped on his keen , kindly , middle-aged face .
or didnt like a fellows face ?
oh , yes , sighed miss pierce , almost ecstatically .
dear , dear , said miss marple .
there was somebody in the room somebody all wet and dripping beatrice taylor come from the river .
and what are we doing about all this ?
satterthwaite , who would easily murder his master if he could be sure of not being found out .
ive exceeded my estimates all round .
she capitulated , murmuring : but , of course , one will have to use influence .
colonel frobisher had been in love with your mother , admiral chandler married her .
' he moved away .
dont tell me .
she stared at him in dismay .
there was a swervea crash .
the true western spirit of hustle , said poirot with a smile .
give it me !
ive never heard of it , she said .
about the middle of the afternoon .
the cord by which it was hung , mademoiselle , was it , like this one , a wire cable ?
that is quite a considerable sum .
poirot leaned forward and spoke sharply , as soon as the young man was out of the room .
oliver scuttled out like a frightened rabbit .
many of my playthings were extemporised .
very faintly , from upstairs , she could hear the same tune being whistled in the bedroom aboveparavicini enacting the part of christopher wren .
and as you say , that girl didnt look quite right in the head to me .
schuster said he couldnt afford the times , he took the telegraph .
gulls point was built on a plateau of rock overlooking the river .
the railway encircles quite half of the property .
hubbard would have been eager to tell how a man passed through her compartment , the button would have been found .
regents court was a new block of flats , situated just off st .
a man died at the stag inn last night .
oh , isaac bodlicott , i think .
im very careful never to leave letters lying about , said tuppence with an air of outraged dignity .
legge ?
my dear girlwhat an awful hole .
hes never been near the house .
one particular fact very likely obsesses your mind .
race strode to the right-hand drawer of the chest and jerked it open .
i suppose you think you know better than a doctor .
hell get over this evening sometime or other , i expect .
well , you do surprise me .
how do you propose to set about it ?
he said , yes , i see .
we shall arrange for you to go to the same placetogether .
and my poor miss lemon , what i have asked her to do , she will not enjoy at all !
so the dogs are howling ?
do you want to talk to loraine now ?
you werent feeling faint .
the embassy would almost certainly refuse to be involved .
the house had not been cleaned up on departure .
beatrice lippincott came out of the room marked no .
silly girls , i call most of em .
she would be the real thing , her reference being supplied by her sister .
their point of view was , but its absurd .
husband was a nice quiet fellow .
look on the bright side , my boy , he adjured me .
he was my fag at eton .
well , i must say im glad youve found her body .
it is a challengeto the little grey cells of my brain .
good money wasted .
you came here today to warn me .
he was marked out for great things and he knew it .
never mindthey were necessary .
mm , a very suggestive title , suggestive of banked fires .
what could edna have known about that ?
quite frankly , im not distinguished in any way in my own profession , you know .
i think it was thrown from the terrace here .
on a world tour , i suppose .
oh , i dont mind your being cross , said ellie .
the time had come when businessin other words , the willwould be discussed .
that is iti would know it anywhere .
christie , another reader also refers to mr .
well have to get her alibi looked into .
youve seen something , heard something ?
that is my name , i replied .
anyway , weve got two possibilities , said giles .
the last moment that the bonds are seen as bonds is in the office of the london and scottish bank on the morning of the _num_ rd .
we all have , in our different degrees .
someone who put the gun in your hedge and then vanished into thin air !
she did not pause to ascertain whether they were friends or foes .
poirot , the detective ?
charnley had been his usual normal self .
its rather faded and torn and knocked about , said tuppence , producing her offering .
there must be something .
poirot , you really must take a grip on yourself .
, had now begun .
frankness is a characteristic of the family .
miss marple exclaimed , do tell me , constable , do you suspect mr .
everybody blinked and peered at each other .
' you don ' t think - she really cared .
so now a busmans holiday , said her husband .
after a minute or two they joined the others .
does miss margrave know ?
it takes all kinds to make a world .
whatever are you doing ?
shes the strong kind , the kind that always gets her way .
theres no blinking it .
looks like a boyfriend to me .
she believes her uncle to be innocent .
you seem to forget that i hold a responsible and arduous position which harry said : responsible and arduous my foot !
im going to my cave .
elinor said : yes , i brought some .
if we were at ainswick now .
ive ordered a car to meet me over there in an hours timeto take me to drymouth .
you see , miss sainsbury seale simpered and bridled , as a girl i was on the stage .
he chaffed me at length about keeping a diary .
s fear of secret being revealed or for jealousy .
look here , carlile , those plans havent vanished into thin air .
when he arrived it was in his most cantankerous mood .
i dont mean just this house , but a lot of places .
there might be another reason , said craddock slowly .
this afternoon .
he gave a sigh of relief as i sat up .
it shows she likes and trusts you .
it has not been shown to us .
yes , well , anyway , this friend of minegwenda , her name isyou know the shop , the post office is one side and envelopes and dirty cards and things the other side , and some china things too , before christmas , you see , and i know , said tuppence , its called mrs .
thought james .
you must realize , monsieur poirot , that the poor child is dead .
clarissa spoke into the telephone .
he once told us about his uncle fred , a crocodile got him in burma , he said sadly .
miss bulstrode noted anew the ugly but interesting bones of her face , a strange , eager , compelling young woman .
thats new since my time , said mrs .
wellhis doctor , i suppose ?
i want you to marry me .
it seems indicated , agreed poirot .
for it is not right , my friend , that a woman like that , still young , still attractive , should refuse life because she believes herself to be tainted .
i dont really know what you are talking about , monsieur poirot .
your ring , said mr .
and curiously , as though from a great distance , she watched the faces of five people to whom that announcement meant freedom part ii chapter _num_ colonel carbury smiled across the table at his guest and raised his glass .
yes , i know , said lady stubbs .
that lets her out of it .
many a game lily used to have with you , miss gwennie .
the lift-bell has rung three times , but he heeds it not .
it was terrible .
merely an acquaintance .
how diminish the toxicity and keep up the hormone content and at the same time neutralize the pantratin ?
her hair was jet blackher face heavily made-up , dead pale .
he always said things in the same slow melancholy waybut half the time there was a twinkle underneath it .
i was too young to have that happen to me .
what was he planning to do ?
owing to the way the manuscript had been following me around , i had no time to lose .
i was blamed for thatand it wont do me any good in my profession , i can tell you .
bowls of goldfish yards of coloured ribbon vanishing ladies all the panoply and misdirection of the conjurers art .
bron has really been too kind , i shall never forget it .
tanios cheeks as she murmured : i havent the least idea .
why does grin hen lo make you think of oxford and cambridge boat race ?
not a nice man .
yes , the balloon goes up tomorrow .
twirling impatiently , she was informed by a cultured voice : the psychology of fear must be thoroughly understood .
but if he was a married manwith children , perhapsand probably an honourable typewell , that would be the end of it .
id like to take a hatchet to that girl .
he closed the french windows after giles and latched them and came back to gwenda .
we had to leave the conversation there , because griselda and dennis burst in upon us and said i was not to make lawrence behave like an old fogy .
that is my view .
frankie , her knees shaking under her , felt suddenly sick .
they were unable , or said they were unable , to tell him anything .
serrocold absently .
life can be very terrible , he said .
he looked up .
anyway , addie matthews lived a very happy life with her two devoted men .
in the end she accepted neither .
oh , dear , bella , its your husband .
yes , i think soits hard to remember .
weston gave a glance round .
its in the library today , i think .
he says he went there because he was born in kent .
there would be no one upstairs on the first floor .
he asked his wife tersely .
he was whistling to himself and jingling some loose change in his pocket .
race said abruptly : if there is nothing more we can do here for the moment , lets go below .
craig groaned .
maverick , coming in , almost collided with them .
should i give my name ?
and i wanted her to suffer .
for the money that would come to your wife ?
which side are you on ?
perhapsup to a point .
your son had no preliminary warning ?
a feeling that there was something unnatural here .
that stops all enquiry .
not until mrs .
i thought , indeed , that he had quarrelled finally with his stepfather .
presently she got up and , still sobbing under her breath , went towards the door .
that means ruinbankruptcy .
its the words written below it that strike me as peculiar .
he reviewed the conversation they had had .
if you dont want me any more , gentlemen , i think ill go home .
you have none of you yet grasped what a very peculiar situation this is .
at any rate , you have .
the man is mad , grumbled the other .
i was down by the hens .
by all means , said gilles .
taxine in rex fortescues breakfast coffee , cyanide in adele fortescues tea .
she had settled to her own satisfaction that it must have been sent by someone whom she alluded to as dear ellens daughter who i know was engaged to be married but i cant remember her name .
tommy was returning with rosalie riding him piggyback , janet surveying the new territory and andrew looking around with an air of taking a full grown-up view .
he said testily , yes , come in , what is it ?
not knowing how wed feel , how wed react .
dr gerard was nothing loath .
i went back into the house and settled ellie on the sofa again .
sergeant cadwallader went across to her , and jan called out , hello , laura .
its true that i seemed to know right away just where everything wasthe kitchen and the linen cupboard .
you may say what you like , charles , but some people are affected by electricity .
poirot , how ever you came to suspect robin upward .
so its over , said sophia .
she said without any other form of greeting .
hes got her as well as everything else and shes not easy .
wouldnt believe that , but its true !
he turned to the two women who were just entering the hall .
your colleague would not have made it , i fancy .
but they will convince you , poirot reassured him .
he looked at me , his eyes bright and shining .
he repeated the christian name thoughtfully .
a temperature of _num_ , sustained for twenty-four hours , would probably involve a visit from the doctor , but anything under that was given little attention .
that is why i thought perhaps under the circumstances yes ?
in the duel between poirot and x , x had won .
looks all right , he murmured to himself .
there wont be any difficulty over that ?
we came down to the riviera again later .
never thought anything like thatd come to st .
luke shook his head sharply .
a week later mrs .
rose overwood .
when the crooks came to recover the jewel , they were to find instead this extremely clever conundrum .
with my wealth i feel under the obligation to serve humanity .
so he left .
or is it ashayet who wreaks vengeance upon me ?
and she beamed round on them all , pausing to shake a finger once more at mr petherick .
i dont like that .
i dont know how i got through the evening .
supposing , he thought , it was she who had gone berserk and attacked her employer ?
what else could it have been ?
but i dont think he ever dreamt of the real reason of why she hadnt come , of why she had sent no word .
that was stupid , too .
_num_ represents the highly magnified surface of a tiny bottle in the top poison cupboard of the dispensary in the red cross hospital at tadminsterwhich sounds like the house that jack built !
mirotin is , in the flesh , an unconventional and breezy woman of forty-five , mary grey .
rodericks been making sheeps eyes at you for some time now .
charles pulled open the top drawer .
presently he said abruptly : madame will excuse me , but is she expecting friends to meet her at nice ?
amyas said : dont fuss about the girl .
i knew that he had made me his executor , so i had a perfect right to do so .
paul droulard was a french deputy of note .
what seems odd to me is that lowen couldnt find a cleverer way of disposing of the ring .
i thinki am surehe cared for me at first .
mr protheroe was lying on the floor , shot through the head , and the pistol was clasped in his right hand .
the coffee at styles was an uninteresting muddy fluid , so we all looked forward to mrs .
can you tell me a little about your husbandwhat kind of a man he was ?
cornworthy here came out of his room which is next door to mr .
if youd just tell me what youre driving at , jane , said mrs .
the quiet gentle voice replied : a good many , im afraid .
then ill go on and ask you something else .
are they poisonous ?
then he said : you think her death was the result of the shock ?
not for pop singers , of course .
you mean that this manthisthis fiend incarnatethis bloodthirsty madman has been following me about waiting for an opportunity ?
she passed up the stairs .
my mother was a saint .
he said drily .
major despard called at wendon cottage about ten minutes later .
i think she is rather , said emlyn price .
do you remember what was said ?
rather an awkward thing to carry about , i objected .
waste of time talking to her , i snapped .
he repeated : oh , my god !
sir bartholomew drinksand dies .
ann wondered about himthere had been some talk of getting extra labourbut this was no yokel .
come out of it , all of you !
teeth tend to grow a little yellow as one grows older , but they were in good condition .
i shall never have a mistress unless i cant get her any other way !
you said you could think of seven people who wouldwell , be glad of colonel protheroes death .
that was to be the great day they were working for .
i felt that i could not do better than keep to poirots scheme of advertising for any information respecting claud darrell .
it was not a bundle of old clothes .
amiss barnard and milly higley .
oh , i am sureabout the murder .
we have exhausted the motive of money .
barnes , ive been retired from the home office for some time nowbut ive not gone quite rusty yet .
to mr .
she said , oh , you must have made a mistake .
im sure you did .
i recognized their methods and once you had described the guests , well , there was no doubt at all in my mind .
she had looked at nobody , but just before she went out , she raised her eyes and took a speedy glance at me .
the daughter doesnt live at home , by the way .
the last thing we observed , as we left the spot , was giraud , crawling about on all fours , with a thoroughness in his search that i could not but admire .
rice went on : fortunately , i dont think anyone in the hotel heard anything .
hallo , i forgot you were here .
colereally he has been very odd lately .
but without undue lyrical expression ?
i said yes .
some ironical humour of his might be satisfied .
i should go on looking about if i were you .
it will be the topic this morning !
she herself made a beeline for the herbaceous border and regarded it with a jealous eye .
hello , smethurst , said his friend .
peter saunders continued to say that of course i could , and that i must begin because he wanted the play quickly .
the dead mans mirror .
bunch and mr edwin moss stood on either side of him , their eyes regarding each other vengefully .
julius hersheimmer !
landed in england a week ago .
our bright spot in sittafordthe willetts .
except , of course , when talking about your masters and betters , politicians and diplomats , foreign office , the establishment , all the other things .
smiling rather wildly , almost leering .
these things always go on much longer than they ought to , of course .
i suppose the compact was in the pocket of the coat and fell out as the body rolled down the slope .
she asked me to inform you that mrs .
or would you prefer coffee , or something like that ?
didn ' t you feel that too ?
no , the murdererthe would-be murderer , i should saycannot be obvious .
someone devoted .
packington had departed to catch the eight forty-five to the city .
oldfield said : thats just it .
mr ryder .
' a lonely , eccentric old fellow .
i dont really know anything about it , said miss marple .
henrys tone was slightly reproachful .
i beg your pardon , he said .
joanna wasnt there .
and yet that had been the convention of those times .
my dear friend , he said , is there anything you do not know ?
you havent given him much chance to admire a girl , have you ?
no mother and daughter at all from south africa .
his passport is in order .
plenty of people have wanted to murder rex in their time .
oh , please believe me .
he thought suddenly of golf links .
as i was saying , bundle , that friend of yours is a very nice girl .
in a way , perhaps , angela came first with herand amyas didnt like that .
really frightfully nice .
then they plunged into a maze of cross-country lanes , steep , green and narrow .
only a lunatic , who wished to commit suicide by causing himself to be hanged , would act so !
after dinner she had coffee on the terrace .
of course i knew really it was only madge pretendingbut was it ?
paid in full .
it worries you , this case ?
if anyone were to attempt such a thing it was far more likely that the attacker would be knocked out by a poker or a lead doorstop and delivered over to the police in a bleeding and humiliated condition .
i gather that in the last war you had rather a delicate assignment .
it produced the goods , did it not ?
awfully county and all that .
he must have known all along , then , that victoria was coming out with themand the whole wonderful coincidence was not , after all , a coincidence .
we inform the police , do all we can for miss durrant , andyes , i think decidedly , we have an interview with mr .
now shes dead , perhaps i misjudged her , poor soul .
from the outer room she led us into the tunnel by which we had first entered , but a short way along this forked , and she turned off to the right .
have one .
the sneer in his words was palpable by now .
i was really happiest about carrie louise when she was married to johnnie restarick .
shoot , stranger , she said .
his mothers wild about it .
i dont know what youre like .
they lunched together at the dorset where mrs .
looked in all the bottles - felt the lining - what the devil could it be ?
nevertheless , she was upset ?
raymond or blunt must have pushed it back , i suggested .
she thought : how absurd !
look here , cant i be there ?
in the meantime , i hope that you will do me the honour to be present at my interrogations , and i need hardly say that if there is any assistance you require it is at your disposal .
he sent madge letters from various people out there , all enthusiastic about the idea .
have you ever been in america , mademoiselle ?
hercule poirot was in the hall and drew her aside before she went into the dining room .
ah , of courseyoure just out of hospital .
quite nicely , of course , as a kind of joke .
such a thought is of a wickedness unbelievable !
youre not keeping me out of this party tonight , said tuppence suspiciously .
the countess rossakoff sailed in .
he stared at her for a moment .
and , turning , the doctor slammed the door sharply in our faces .
this was an intensely personal room .
and did he frighten you ?
a voice spoke behind hima testy impatient voice .
it was a fine test for my new friend from the middle east .
satterthwaite had encountered once or twice under somewhat mystifying circumstances .
thompson nodded .
i suppose theres a doctor here somewhere ?
the road along which she had come stretched back apparently into an infinity of waste .
i havent seen you this afternoon at all , miss marple .
she led the way to the door from which she had entered .
whom the gods destroy , they first drive mad .
but not to such a point that she ought to be in a mental home ?
it is a long time ago .
miss jones has been with me for two months as a shorthand typist .
foster was somewhat hazy about a vistabut he gave a cautious and grudging assent .
well , perhaps , it was something faintly approaching that .
well , doctor , he said , i dont think we need detain you now .
his clothes , his beard , the glasses which hide his eyesthose are the salient points about his personal appearance .
in effect , the letter says nothing at all .
i am a student of the psychology , you understand .
that idiot pagett , with his wife and family !
we shall have to go into that matter , said dermot .
how the devil you knew that i cant think , said the other at last , but youre right .
its very important (she released the key) .
it ran : try foreign office ?
one can go too far even with christian gestures , said monsieur grosjean .
he smiled modestly .
if so , it is rather a sitter for us , said tommy .
in old desks .
do you want to hear what he said next ?
a tonic ?
but his attention was distracted by his colleague and he did not wait for a reply .
i suppose you wouldnt like to come round ?
dash it all , theres got to be such a thing as good faith .
but hubert liked him , i know , and trusted him , too .
look behind you !
see if there are any traces of taxine .
he was making inquiries about various small properties with a view to purchase .
he spoke now almost more to himself than to his guest .
im responsible for running this place .
a case that seemed to be shaping in well-known fashion had gone suddenly haywire .
i think its rather wonderful , dont you , to be like that ?
sitting in his room at the police station he looked across the table at poirot .
but when he talked i saw a gold tooth one side of his mouth .
in my heartin my feeling .
marchmont had caught sight of david hunter walking along the footpathso the coast was clear .
all that we do know is this : that at nurse hopkins instigation , mary gerrard made a will leaving everything she had to mary riley , sister of eliza riley .
he was quarrelsome and abusive and had had a row with most people in the place .
young raymond boyntons out of it .
i love claire .
oh , about three weeks or a month ago .
and so she makes her greedy bit for hush money , and in so doing signs her death warrant .
i saw in my minds eye sybil in her peacock dress with its scrawled symbols of evil .
my coffee bar is in tottenham court road , as a matter of fact .
youre too unselfish .
he was a bit ratty one day , admitted elsie .
the whole house is full of him .
they were very much what you would expect to findsome very mediocre landscapes , some oleographs and a few cheaply-framed reproductions .
hes come here under the force of a persistent ideato find m .
all the right rhododendrons and all the right bedding out done in the proper season , i expect .
could she see any of these people committing murder ?
she was the most glorious creature he had ever seen .
ah , said mrs .
youll see , said mrs .
oh , lord , i give it up !
youre probably quite right !
are you afraid im going to make love to the butcher , silly ?
poirot compared it carefully with the anonymous letters .
now there is nothing else that struck you as unusual this evening ?
i remember thatbut i dont remember when it was .
ii to be received by a hotel manager correctly garbed in frock coat and patent leather shoes seemed somehow ludicrous in this out of the world , or rather above-the-world , spot .
the murderer slips away unnoticed , hides behind that sycamore tree in the middle of the lawn .
so that i can picture it , perhaps , in my mind .
it was the old butler who spoke , standing apologetically in the doorway .
i came round here hoping to be able to warn you before the police got here , but i was too late .
but the main facts remain .
id have thought shed be sure to doll herself up .
not yesterday , sir .
he found her incredulity moving .
also , he is irritable and unreasonable when i ask many questions of searching nature .
looking around the room , the man asked , can i get you adrinkor something ?
but elsie clayton was not one of those women .
i have decided to accept twelve casesno more , no less .
the words lower border conveyed absolutely nothing to her mindexcept a vague suggestion of a scottish songbut it was clear that to macdonald they constituted an insuperable objection .
this was his feeling for niceties .
craddock busied himself with various other matters that were waiting attention on his desk .
portraits of simpering great ladies sitting smirking in silks and velvets and lace .
colonel johnson said abruptly : these stones have been stolen .
but though my mother recognised that at the time , and must indeed have recognised it very much better later , yet i think she was content to have had it so .
hed no persecution complex or anything of that kind .
in many ways it was a near castle of modest proportions .
but i think these girls , when they come home , they get rather restlessand if there is someone else aboutsomeone , perhaps , who has led an adventurous life such as david hunter ?
but it does not entirely satisfy me .
thats what they usually do , isnt it ?
so much better than his usual sermons .
i thought she wasand hori thought sobut now .
dim , yes .
weston looked down appraisingly on the objects .
hargraves always saidthoroughly to be relied upon to turn the mattresses every dayexcept fridays , of course .
oo , said mrs .

oliver , you mean ?
for the letters were her own , written to gerald martin before she married him .

i had a few adventures myself .
she settled herself in the rickety armchair , with terry on her knees .

a very slight and possibly unimportant point .
you cant be sure now , either , can you ?

an elderly butler received him , and after a wash and a shave he was shown into a room with a huge fire burning in the grate , and breakfast was served to him .
he told us that there was a very good example of the debased architecture of the period just round the bend of the valley .
he listened for a moment or two , then tried the handle .
what shall we do with this junk ?
we enjoyed ourselves .
it was the bewildered , hurt tone of a child .
they rejoiced and conquered !
she wasnt a handsome child , like the other two .
miss marple looked at her .
i heard you were on this job too .

bollard took it from her .
it was my great hope that someday , i , too , might figure in a cause clbre and be the instrument of bringing a murderer to justice !

very odd .
well , i wouldnt like to go as far as that .
im getting down and out over the business .

and that was three years ago .
of course she isnt dead !
you did me a good turn once .
the girl murmured something in rejoinder .
not , of course , that there was any real likelihood of her being able to afford the place .
but i dont believe it will work .

an evening frock , and a pretty bracelet .

she says that she went into the privy garden to be quiet for a little .
clarissa , he asked her , do you ever speak the truth ?
it is true that i have the habit of being always rightbut i do not boast of it .

it was neat and fresh , ivory brushes on the dressing tableno clothes lying about .
fourteen , guvnor , replied the other hoarsely .

john gordon macarthur , that on the _num_ th of january , _num_ , you deliberately sent your wifes lover , arthur richmond , to his death .
it appears that there was a murder here tonight .
and perhaps i might get it cheapin the circumstances .
and i screamed and once i began i couldnt stop screaming , and somehow i got out of the room and through the front door like a bat out of hell , the inspector remembered colins description .
mon cher , i said today that i was the opposite of the conjurerthat i make the disappearing things reappearbut suppose someone has been beforehand with me .

the evidence against him , she reminded herself , was still exactly what it had been .
henrietta suggested to gerda that they should go and look at the kitchen garden .
know what it is to have workmen in the house .
as i say , sir gervase seemed to be finding it hard to concentratein fact , he said as much , adding that he had several grave matters preying on his mind .
well , presumably to admit her confederate , the black- bearded man .
ivan , said the russian softly , perhaps you would not mind retiring into the next room the next room wont do , interrupted julius .
i came out of my dream and added my quota .
hallo , heres a piece of luck .
if it was a tramp .

he was going toof courseto the congress at lucerne .
three days later .
blore said : not a doubt of it .
sunlight was pouring into the room .
he crossed to the french windows , held back a curtain , and peered out as though seeking inspiration .
yesyesa very dreadful experience .
underhay .
a feeling of uneasiness swept over him .
no wonder i had been unable to find her on the boat .
not really an old faithful ?
one of the last houses had a sign decorated in old gold lettering with the word antiques on it .
the bexhill crime ?
one faints .
bed , said virginia , yawning .
roger spoke awkwardly .
we dont want to hang about , i can assure you .
she had had on a new white dress , ever so sweet with one of the new necks .
but when i thought it over carefully i realized that every word she had said on the subject had been uttered with diametrically the opposite end in view .
the point is , did angell really see me , or is he pretending he did ?
i wonder if you really know what you are doing .
he had been worried about the advent of rosalind beforehand , being afraid , as he said , that nobody would take any notice of him any more .
yes , said alexander noncommittally .
there has been no hue-and-cry , no real suspicion .
she can tell you what might have happened and what ought to have happened and even what actually did happen !
hit or miss .
well , said the inspector in a flat tone , so thats that .
bert , dear , call out to edith to bring the tea along .
she broke down , weeping bitterly .
the little cottage to which they bent their footsteps was spotlessly clean and neat .
she would becomeby lawmy daughter .
shes always one for a change , gladdie is .
all very well for henrietta to defend herto say that gerdas story was perfectly possible .
do you realize , cartwright , that practically every person who was present at the dinner at your house was present here ?
as a professional man , i naturally aim at discretion .
blackberries are said to be full of vitamins , but they may be deadly in other ways .

she transferred the plate of sandwiches to the stool , then carefully shook the cushions on the sofa .
he always stated things literally and took them at their face value .
what were you looking for upstairs ?
serrocold shook her head in a bewildered fashion .
you are the type of man who invests in doubtful oil fields , and non-existent gold mines .
and goosey , goosey , gander ?
his voice broke and he rushed out of the room .
it was a thoroughly fishy story , said miss blacklock , with vigour .
strete was on the left of the fireplaceclose to the door out of the hall to the lobby , and its a very dark corner .
leidner written them herself ?
in that way , yes , i said .
i wanted to hear what he had to say about our own particular setup .
nevertheless , i recalled the case fairly accurately .
oh , yes , there were plenty of opportunities .
oh , my dear friend , when a girl is nervous it usually means a young mannot crime .
then he went over to his corner cupboard .
why couldnt archie have agreed to our marriage in london , where everything would have been easy and simple .
elinor felt as though imprisoned in a thick mist .
oh , some modern reaction !
ii leo argyle signed the last of the letters which gwenda vaughan placed in front of him .
i am enrhumi have the cold in the head .
are you sure you are not being carried away by professional zeal ?
in the end archie got the ships doctor to have a look at me .
her brown eyes , gentle and ingenuous , looked with childish appeal at mr .
all this was a long business and he did not expect to be back until the afternoon .
did someone brush against him in the darkness and smear tell-tale evidence on his sleeve ?
i see you enjoy the cards even though you do not play bridge , he remarked .
you are sure it was mr .
tea came and the muffins .
i like variety .
henrietta looked , if anything , belligerent .
thats not what they said .
and there was water on the sheet .
in fact all these people seemed ready to smile if there was anything to smile at .
thats what frightened me because i knew if i thought for a minute id know why she didnt see me , and i didnt want to know .
and what did you do when you came in ?
he snapped the locks of the suitcase , and turned quickly to bill .
why did you three change your plans this evening ?
hes that kind of young ass .
go on , try it for yourself .
her arms were spread out in front of her , and she had evidently just lifted her head from where it had been buried .
and she beamed encouragingly upon him .
so she had cooked up this fine tale about a strange lady .
colonel race and myself are endeavouring to track down a murderer .
he slipped his hand into his pocket .
he took a step away from her , and then turned to face her again .
as we entered , however , her limbs relaxed , and she fell back upon the pillows .
suddenly she broke out fiercely : im odious .
there were girls who had reacted unfavourably to school life of the conventional type .
you do , john .
she cant think of anything else .
he looked at her attentively .
of the three members of the younger generation she alone seemed to be made of the metal that had raised up the vast abernethie fortunes .
we believe you .
time enough , she thought .
oh it was , sir .
blair would take the hint .
her name has been registered there as taking a room the night before by one of knightons female accomplices .
no ideas ?
clarissa shut the door behind him , and went off to the kitchen to finish making the sandwiches .
what is this mrs .
and as for youwhere is your mother ?
what exactly did she say ?
rowland with enthusiasm .
i hate the war .
easy enough to dodge him .
the prime minister looked up .
but he did not feel very sure about it .
his holdings have gone steadily down .
lets canter again , she said .
it was eggs clear voice that drew the attention of the room , though lady mary had risen and stretched out an anxious hand .
our posts are a little uncertain .
raymond looked surprised .
and now look at this !
that gets in at ten oclock , eh ?
it dtea 	warred with the essential mother love clear that a love of money 	gaining the day .
discounting the frozen look weve heard so much about ?
did anything in her appearance strike you as out of the ordinary ?
it was to her sister , mary riley , in new zealand , that eliza riley wrote the truth .
you dont think i do think , said miss marple .
i do reserve the right to give a few words of advice now and then .
now if you had a woman there as a matter of fact we have yes , those dreadful policewomen in funny hats who bother people in parks !
no woman could act her part with that icy unconcern .
he looked unusually handsome and arrogant .
he laid a hand on mr .
but why has it got to happen to you ?
henrietta said slowly : i remember now .
its your elder sister .
they could get him easily enough anywhere , but they took extraordinary pains and trouble to get him here , and whoever they were they knew all about you , your cottage at datchet , your usual household arrangements , and the fact that you were at ranelagh this afternoon .
he takes how do you say ?
he died six years ago .
the fever had abated for the moment , and he could think clearly and lucidly .
very educational , said afflick .
this matter , he said severely , is highly confidential .
i decided then that id not go on living under his roof .
on arrival egg volunteered to ring up sir charles and explain the nonappearance of his guest .
' ' anything else ?
the poor old beans gone , said tommy , and she went peacefully and without suffering .
lovely , she was thinking .
pack of lies it was too , all about a crook called ready rita .
its not a case of desertion .
rather unexpectedly rosaleen cloade got up .
im looking for my little yellow berrya little yellow hat .
of course ive gone over it all with beatrice again and again .
my brother was killedpainlessly , i hope .
no , said miss gorringe , _num_ .

it couldnt happen .
you just never know what hes thinking about things .
yes , i mean mr .
a loud hie greeted us as we emerged from the vicarage gate , and my nephew , dennis , came running up the road from the village to join us .
actually i understood she wasnt coming out for another fortnight or so , but i didnt read her letter very carefully , and then i mislaid it , so i didnt really remember what she said .
almost certainly i should say .
i didnt know a thing , said belcher .
its cost my father his life , and its all but ruined the lives of all of us as well .
as he ate it , he was conscious , not for the first time , of the close scrutiny of a man who sat at the table next to him .
it was the picture of a woman with a complete image of herself , of what she was , but about which she was completely mistaken .
clarissa , my dear , he said .
very awkward , indeed .
if i might be seated ?
in case of a refusal , lady tadminster might open it the first day , and mrs .
a real peacock ?
you wouldnt have heard of them !
shes suffering agony , and borne it without a word , just because she was too scared to come and find out that what she feared might be true .
many thanks for repeating my poor brother-in-laws last words so punctiliously in spite of their trivial character .
well , man , ask away , what do you want to know ?
in fact , she did not try to .
had messieurs anything to declare ?
not until somebodys found out a bit more about all this , said professor eckstein .
i hope you havent been tired with so many people here .
tuppence rose .
from all accounts hes rich .
i wont have it .
she decides to say nothing to her husband , but sits down and writes to her solicitor , asking him to come on the morrow , and she also determines to destroy immediately the will which she has just made .
that blood poisoning definitely points to a medical murderer !
satterthwaite had always been a snob .
what do you know about young girls ?
empty !
i would like you to see one or two of our bed-sitting rooms .
he found an imperturbable george pressing trousers .
a can of hot water was on the washstand , and i proceeded to unpack a few necessaries .
shall i bring you in some tea and something ?
she would treat her as a daughter .
very few people knew about him and very few employed his servicesbut those few were usually extremely rich .
by the look of them they had been dead for some time .
four in the awesome majesty of mrs .
why has he come back ?
and then , chri , never , never will i breathe breathe what ?
you are not annoyed with me ?
i sold the house .
it puzzled me .
suzanne nodded .
he paused , swayed slightly , and said in a low quivering voice , murderers .
thank you so much , she said , both you and your husband .
they find the pistol ?
its always them as isnt that can afford to joke about it .
you see what all are bound to see , what cannot be missed , captain harwell in the limelight , a suspicious figure .
taking charge of the situation , and summoning her courage , she went to the desk and started to dial .
they say all sorts of awful things about themselves and enjoy saying them .
jane passed in and sat down .
nothe other .
it is abhorrent to me that an innocent person or creature should suffer or die by any act of mine .
he arrived at the front door just in time to see miss milray getting into a taxi .
you know all about those photographs by now , so i will only say that mrs .
she really came in and said so .
he had seen it on a sign-post earlier in the day .
thats because youre so englishso reticent !
i think she might have been nine or ten , but perhaps older , i dont know .
quiet , of course .
ratchetts secretary .
miss bennetts retort was equally sharp .
she never wanted to hurt him , said miss reilly slowly .
oh , i must have left it in the room upstairs .
your narrative style is masterly , murmured poirot .
frankness , mr .
poirot bowed and moved to the door .
the policethe lawyersthey will all ask the same question : why did major rich kill m .
do you think hed use a cosh on anyone ?
but possibly a strong sense of self-preservation .
it inclined him very slightly to the belief that mrs .
in doing so , she made a number of significant changes .
are there any of his paintings in the cottage ?
mercy , she murmured .
he could have gone to his wifes sitting room and killed her any time during that twenty minutes .
i read in the paper that you were fond of eating apples , the accusing voice of ann or susanshe was not quite sure whichspoke to her .
as regards the barrow , i mean .
i explained the similarity of the handwriting on the letter that mr .
dont really know .
not from your colleagues , of course .
roberts , his professional instincts aroused , came briskly across the floor with a bounding medical in-at-the-death step .
now just tell me in your own words how you came to be at _num_ , wilbraham crescent today .
he managed to produce ticket and passport and other necessities for the journey .
inspector neele and professor bernsdorff of st .
dora bunner even prattled about a burn on the table where someone had put their cigarette downbut nobody had even lit a cigarette and the violets were dead because there was no water in the vasea slip on letitias partshe ought to have filled it up again .
its the cleverest swindle since the time of horatio bottomley .
look here , what about this ?
no , not that alonethough he is unusually good-looking for an englishmanwhat your lady novelists would call a greek god .
she had a sharp intelligence and a love of power .
she wanted to forgetforget everything none of it was real any longer .
quite dazed he looked and just turning over the food on his plate without eating it .
me , i have other ideas , confessed poirot .
i was looking at her at the funeral that day and thinking what a frump she was and that really one might as well be dead if one looked like thatand now she is dead .
i considered the problem of howard raikes .
she murmured , and this time her voice held a definite note of apprehension .
as for the reason why i suspect miss debenham , there are two .
hes a great reader of detective stories .
we posted it to vyse .
not the christmas bring and buy .
but ive a feeling that there is something very wrong with her now .
you cant write letters to people who go to anatolia in buses .
his eyes grew suddenly very green .
you are a local man , sergeant , can you tell me if captain trevelyan was a man who made enemies easily ?
then , if they are negative or positive , you and i , mrs .
with a supreme effort she jerked herself free and clung cowering against the wall .
vincent had been thankful for that at the time .
i liked miss fisher as soon as i saw her .
clarissa smiled again .
shall ihow much ?
i wonder now said griselda .
i dont think they really seem to care for each other very much , marie .

at the chemists .
odd that the sun had gone in and that they should both have shiveredperhaps just at the moment that that woman was watching them .

he made up a romantic story of a book he was writing , so as to induce your daughter to bring them with her .
and then of course later in the day we hear her own son has been arrested for having done it .
it seems a curious case , i said .
first of all , said sir charles , i would like to ask you if you have had any communication from the home office ?
do you know , i believe youre right !
i added some more characters .
it was all such funand now , just latelyperhaps old palgraves death upset her .
monsieur poirot was within .
after wringing poirots hand and endeavouring very incoherently and unsuccessfully to thank him , mr .
he would not do it that way .
able to cope with things .
' would you mind putting this in your post-bag ?
she looked at the dead man curiously and as though wonderingshe gave no start , no sign of emotion or recognition , just looked long and wonderingly at him .
supposing that anne meredith was a girl with a weak streak in her characterthe kind of girl who takes little things from the big shops .
as a matter of fact i havent had breakfast yet .
hes got ampoules of amyl nitrate to use when he feels an attack is coming on .
i stay there until it is daylight .

i only thought that when committing suicide youd prefer to take an overdose of a soporific rather than to feed yourself prussic acid .

but you might have been an accomplice before the act .
i carried out my programme .
i could prevent anything happening at the hydro , just by saying a few words to show him i suspected .
she just shares the flat .
i said that i felt i ought to remember something about it , that it was just as though it was all coming back , and then , before i could get hold of it , it went again .
something the matter with him , too , thought dr gerard .
it might be very difficult getting back here .
so she went after all !
roses face grew grave .
i have to agreethat can and does happennot often , of that i assure youbut yessometimes mr lazenby was fidgeting again with his pipe .
you are adopting a highly improper tone .
race asked : how did you discover they had been taken ?
the house from which there is no return .
he was a different man .
for once in his life he looked almost embarrassed .
they were laughing and joking together .
edward ferrier .
opposite the door were the two barred windows giving on the countryside .
i forget everything now im getting old .
then , as often happens , life parted us .
there seems to be a doom in this place .
he said : the world is yours .
she looked worried and thoughtful .
theres the child superstition , of course , said luke .
i want to know if m .
supposing i did give her the stuff ?
he said : ah , here we are .
kaits face was the same as usual , affectionate , plain , expressionless .
form up , please .
the dearest girl in the world .
then she went to the front door and opened it .
its so interesting to hear all this , she added .
in carlottas case the verdict was death by misadventure .
pretend ?
the idea that ellis might be dead had come to him then .
he had not noticed any wasp .
her relations with old morley were perfectly pewerim sure of it .
as for his sister , well , ive not actually spoken to her , but shes a very queer-looking girl .
he wanted to go after herto reassure herhe had the strangest feeling that she was in danger of some kind .
the dark young man nodded .
this discussion is unprofitable , he said reprovingly .
women do when theyve got what they want .
it felt like a pebble , a large round pebble .
some of the other young women in the house had been expecting to hear from her , but she had never written or given them any address .
his information was meagre .
havent you got the sense to hold your tongue ?
well , what i mean to saystrangled , you know .
tuppence thought : i hopei hope these young things arent in it !
the guide proceeded to instruct them on the subject of the temple built by the great rameses .
did i see you talking to the detective this morning before breakfast ?
nothere was nothing special about our conversation .
i always thought that was rather unnecessarily vindictive .
no statement at all ?
she is a young lady much in the news , that .
two boys , weve got .
can i see if there are any more chocolate biscuits in the larder , clarissa ?
petherick said , very up to date in his methods , and he had indicated a certain line of defence .
its nice that the story has such a happy ending , said lynn .
it was from m .
the suggestion of murder thrown out at the funeral was only the first step , of course , said poirot .
he is going away ?
chapter _num_ it was three days later that hercule poirot went to the mount of the prophet .
how to explain to megan the impulse that had come over me ?
and certainly nothing criminal .
we might go part of the way together .
from his point of view it was a perfectly sensible remark .
he is conducted to the chair .
roddy said in a bewildered voice : but what happens now ?
but shes determined to worry celia about them .
black and yellow ?
safest place for the moment .
the train being at a standstill made it all very quiet .
oh , of coursebut it wouldnt do , would it , to repeat just idle talk ?
you are fond of cats ?
carols lips moved soundlessly .
mcginty used something that was said to be like a chopper .
and if you think you can order me about , you can think again !
as for them , they are canailleall of them .
fear we shall be too late anyway .
she was unhappybrokenhearted .
first , judging of the broomstick competition , she said , three prizes , first , second and third .
there was something .
well , said charles , what do you think of him ?
her employer behind his desk seemed contorted with agony .
i mean to get rid of her .
and immediately , her old affection reasserting itself , she puts up a quick camouflage .
' hercule poirot shrugged his shoulders .
betts admiringly .
justice wargrave , lately retired from the bench , puffed at a cigar and ran an interested eye through the political news in the times .
again that queer magic of hers held him .
by the stairs was a notice : office .
then you arrive home by a later train and do the surprised innocent .
her hair was rolled into a rather hideous bun and she wore very efficient-looking pince-nez .
these cases of lost memory , or secondary personality , are often of very short duration .
the eternal triangle ; two men and a woman .
shed been taken into the house because of her being the secretary of the st .
marie did not seem to me as distressed as i thought she ought to have been , however , she must have attempted some condolence with my mother , who came to me with some annoyance .
race assented .
she paused once more , and the inspectors yes ?
dont hustle me , roly , hugo exclaimed .
elmsleigh gardens was a quiet , rather dingy kensington square .
living under exacting security conditions .
marcia was magnificent , unique , a perfect political hostess .
surely the whole thing is clear as daylight .
gilroy , gilroy , jaimes and gilroy are a very eminent firm of lawyers .
whats he got to do with it ?
boris melted into the shadows .
deciding that the master had got to be found , albert , rather after the manner of a faithful dog , set out to find him .
everything , he said , absolutely everything .
race shook his head .
he made careful preparations , wrapping himself in several coats and mufflers and encasing his neat boots in goloshes .
there are different ways of saying things , you know .
haydocks house is next door to mine .
as far as i can remember , raymond boynton and the red-haired boynton girl came in shortly afterwards .
i know , if you can understand , not who he is but who he is .
i must go and speak to him .
a great attacker .
no , there are no live-in servants , only dailies who come in .
i had been on nortons tracks for some time .
no , but ive heard things about you .
how can one ever be expected to do any serious work with these constant interruptions .
of course , said greg , i dont know what time the girl was actually killed ?
shes seeing too much of him .
do not figure to yourself that i am playing a lone hand .
the desire for money grows .
i mean , we were together a lot on the cruise , and we went to see the places but i didnt really get to know her particularly well .
kennedy looked a little surprised .
nobody could make a better show of presenting a very small portion of the truth and implying that it was the whole truth than inspector craddock .
denounced him to the police ?
but soon she would be in london .
did a lot of foolish things .
shes the kitchenmaid , sir .
he would be terribly weak , said the nurse .
mrs spenlow was a well-to-do woman .
answer n or m .
osbornes description of the man he had seen that night was interesting .
and bobby ?
' but the postmark on the letter ?
he stared at the paper and he stared at molly .
and it is certainly true that on the following day mr .
and if mr .
bit of a mess at the moment and all that , but well get there all right in the end .
finally dr .
their muslin frocks !
he washe was terribly bitter against caroline .
as far as i can tell , the house was not entered forcibly from the outside .
you sent me a list of those things that had disappearedand other queer happeningswhat i have to ask is this , did you write that list in chronological order ?
is there a dog kept here by any chance , mademoiselle ?
for the other , when at prayer in the chapel , my spirit has often been caught up from my body , and i have been as one dead for many hours .
rennie , i think ?
the pitcher goes to the well once too often , remember .
poirot is quite right .
the power of the money bribe could not fail .
laura welman said sharply : are you unhappy , child ?
let me introduce you to baronererand captain andrassy .
angus macwhirter only gave a grunt by way of thanks .
blackbirds !
she felt slightly uncomfortable .
the doctor had accepted the matter so naturally , had been so matter-of-fact and unperturbed by it , that jack was impressed .
speaking for myself , sir , he said respectfully , i want nothing more .
nothing else .
theres nothing wed want not for a day or two absolutely frightful dont fuss .
such remarks as he was now making seemed to be addressed to the left-hand corner of the chromium-plated fireplace curb .
trading with the enemy , thats what it amounts to .
then his face grew grave , and he looked inquiringly at inspector slack .
i mean , once they are dead it doesnt seem to matter why , and to make a fuss about it all seems so silly .
nick , i noticed , made a good hostess .
but really , its very difficult to know what you do want .
jerry !
from this i deduce that garden parties were practically always held in august .
miss bulstrode knew all about her new pupil who had just come from a school in switzerland , but was a little hazy as to who it was escorting her .
it had been said that if mr .
weve got to go on living our lives in the present .
what i cant understand is what the child sees in him .
weak ?
eleven the accident happens the rendezvous for the great accident party was fixed at a spot about a mile from staverley village where the road to staverley branched off from the main road to andover .
it was a hot , airless morning towards the end of june .
he stressed the last word strongly .
i have always admired red-haired women .
it will be a great shock to her .
my attention was drawn to an a b c railway guide , sir , under the seat .
and how is my good friend , your father ?
you see , youd be quite safe with me and bridget interrupted : safe ?
prying into peoples private affairs tuppence shook herself , an impatient terrier shake that was a reminiscence of her girlhood .
quin no .
got a wire from emmamy sister .
' he goes round the deck forty-eight times exactly , ' said mis henderson .
to exeter .
i realized now why the butlers face had struck me as being faintly familiar when i first saw it .
the fourth man still had the expression of one who suspends belief .
you will excuse me , monsieur , she said , but may i ask your name ?
and then i thought but nobody does live here , im sure they dont .
gulbrandsen announced his intention of working in his own room and left the rest of the party here after coffee had been served .
i think we shall make an interesting find , too .
as i said the other evening , miss meredith would only commit a murder through fear .
and hes awfully good-natured .
i had assumedassumed quite certainlythat judith had yielded to allertons specious proposals .
the chief constable , he , too , has not had the advantages of a friendly relationship with them .
im sorry , sir , but the cat is not available at the present moment .
i dare say , said miss harmon , that harry laxton will suggest that himself .
they had the stern part of the deck to themselves .
i have returned , madame .
nom dun nom dun nom !
that hearty english manner !
cried carol scornfully .
hotels , people who kept lodgings , boarding-housesall those within a wide radius of the crimes were questioned minutely .
once they took the wrong turning and went nearly half a mile out of their direction .
i went out into the night .
oh , it is , said mrs .
it is not i .
and finally margharita .
the fact of the matter is , one can only theorize .
poirot , i cannot believe you are serious .
what went on in baghdad ?
poirot looked worried .
and the bottles ?
for the first time they gave her their full attention .
' ' well , she had her hands to her head .
yes , go on .
rather wonderful person , isnt she ?
we can get down to things about it later but its really so extraordinary .
i dont know what youre getting at , but he did mention that there was a tension and stiffness about the limbs which he was quite at a loss to account for .
she said at last reluctantly : yes , you may be right , sir .
but tell me , madame .
lucy thought quickly .
certainly , superintendent .
didnt she have any people come in to clean for her or anything like that ?
always i felt that there was a j .
she wouldnt go by the boat train to london as she had planned .
she had left of her own accord as she had not cared for the type of work .
captain trevelyan , i suppose , must have been upstairs .
edward simply wouldnt know ; you , midge , are always so practical .
the bell rings in here .
it was not a house , she thought , that had been , at any rate of late years , loved in any way .
in both cheeks was a spot of hard colour .
do you think he killed marlene tucker ?
i heard something something last night .
dont let us risk that !
ar .
was there an instant flash of relief , of relaxed tension ?
he responded promptly after glancing at his watch .
he was very quiet and correct .
richard was about to respond to lucias outburst when his attention was claimed by the telephone he was holding .
the intensely quiet young man who never speaks .
she could not write downstairs - there were no writing materials .
im forgetting my manners .
he asked confusedly .
somebodys hidden my skis .
i beg your pardon , he said formally .
i picked up the morning paper which had fallen from my hand and resumed my perusal of the mornings news .
poirot went on : there is another point worthy of consideration .
and she knew now that jessops diagnosis had been correct .
about nine thirty or ten , but i could go back earlier .
crome was not , i think , any too pleased to see the various participants in the drama .
you had a methodand it was connected with a hypodermic syringe .
beauty at any price .
lord alloway looked discomfited , and poirot continued : tell me , milor , was any reference made in her hearing to the subjects you and the admiral were going to discuss together ?
decoded , it was short and to the point .
then since we know who we are , i may come in ?
it showsi think it shows that he finds his position weaker than he thought it .
and ill screamat the top of my voice .
the statuesque brunette you go around with .
not know what shes like when ive been married to her for over eight years ?
meynell , trying to think of something else even more dashingand failing .
it was one of the smaller rooms , though even then it was larger than the drawing room of most modern houses .
the phenomena had only taken place in the last two months .
he was also a stupid manthat is why he is dead .
as for the four others , ive had them shadowed , naturally , but without any tangible result .
i think probably notbut one cannot be certain yet .
he told her then .
thought molly .
hercule poirot replied gravely : yes .
miss brewis was with him , speaking rather breathlessly .
then , when we pounce , we pounce .
then , as she brought the second tray into the hall , i think she looked along the passage to the side door , and saw him there , beckoning to her .
i guess shed been told to win my confidence .
theyre fairly cheap .
south america , as i say , is one of the strongholds .
are you in some kind of a hole ?
sir ernest heavywether , who was famous all over england for the unscrupulous manner in which he bullied witnesses , only asked two questions .
immediately his excitement returned .
you have told me something i wanted to know .
you have already thought about that ?
if theyd known for sure that someone was trying to poison me , theyd have let us leave here , theyd have let us get away .
he told me beforehand that he meant to do it .
wish we could say the same of ourselves .
poirot looked thoughtfully round the room .
but hickory road isnt really a noisy road .
couldnt you have told her just to wait until i was free ?
scientifically speaking , aunt caroline might have poisoned uncle claud .
betterton along to her husband .
you would , perhaps isabel flushed a little .
you must have wondered why i didnt turn up this morning as arranged .
you use the word murder ?
and the lady .
telegram sent to m .
then , with a sudden gesture , he drew lazarus aside .
she asked me why i was so cross .
thats right , said father .
i am afraid the milk is cold now .
itll come to me , i have no doubt .
weve had the autopsyi brought a report of the findings alongthought it might interest you thats very kind of youit wouldhmhm .
no one has any additional questions ?
what one feels is oftentrue .
blessed if i know what its all about .
meaning that the theft was aimed at damaging me ?
schneider ?
and they were fond of each other ?
hubbard firmly .
he was shown into a big double room on the left of the small hallway and there magdalen came to him .
a woman couldnt drag a body round the house .
and went away again without saying anything ?
bad habit , lunch .
not at all , said mr jesmond .
naturally her home is with us .
leidner seemed to like talking together .
make an offer and set the ball rolling .
it was the matter-of-fact way she said it that was so spine-chilling .
people had always laughed at him .
we went to the pit stalls alwaysthe pit itself was supposed to be rough .
anything to do with boats he was good at .
he rang the bell violently .
three-four-eight harley street , he murmured to the driver .
who provisioned the island and made all the necessary arrangements ?
just something that wasntoh , i dont know .
he wasnt really responsible for what he had done , and the truth was known , and everyone was sorry for mabel and could not do enough to make up to her for the unjust suspicions they had had .
ii didnt see him again .
leidner before you joined this expedition ?
' you are kind .
i saw joannas fair head jerk backwards in what i knew to be a warlike gesture .
you they both looked extremely nervous , and ill at ease with each other .
inquired tuppence ecstatically , as she skipped down the steps .
do you think all these awful things are true ?
what about major burnaby ?
dacres really looked like it was impossible to tell .
these prizes , i may say , cost us _num_ .
alistair blunts niece .
on the other hand , if the news of my escape were wired to chichester , and also the information that i had left cape town for durban , nothing was simpler for him than to leave the boat at either port elizabeth or east london and so give me the slip completely .
you agree with that ?
at the conclusion of rogers evidence there was a pause .
miss lawson _num_ .
edward went down and put his head in the gas oven in the night , she said .
this button .
if shes up wed better have her along .
so it really is a relief to talk it over with you , midge .
it was made for her !
thats only _num_ , mrs .
as a blind .
poirot asked : general arundell has no other sons or daughters living ?
the restaurant was hot , but she had worn a yellow wool pullover , a black skirt and black woollen stockings , and the perspiration poured down her face all through the meal .
poirot asked : what about mrs .
theres one thing might help .
peggy macleod arrived next day , having motored day and night across england with crystal , my godchild , who was three years old , and david , who was five .
and there was , strangely enough , what craddock could only describe as a roguish twinkle in her faded blue eyes .
we can do more of that later .
race and poirot crept out meekly .
now , miss dunn , although you may never have heard of the fact , your grandmother had a great friend , eliza leech .
i said , theres a letter for you in the hall .
edward mastermanenglish subject .
yes , i said , quite well .
thirty-three a new theory monsieur poirot wants to see you , sir .
oliver , mistaking her interest .
but she had got hold of a quite nice bartolozzi engravingdamp spotted unfortunately .
small time .
gordon ?
look here , tuppence , this whole thing is all somethings and someones .
hugo was waiting for her insideshe was quite sure of it .
drinking a glass of port .
and partly at the suggestion ofa friend .
well go to mr .
george and the boy followed him up closely , still carrying the limp body of frankie .
im not accusing you of trying to stage a mother and daughter sentimental meeting .
theyve gone to work .
up till then you suspected them , didnt you ?
six cynthia dacres the showrooms of ambrosine , ltd , were very pure in appearance .
i wanted to get away from him .
rosalind took a poor view of this and howled every time it happened .
youre one of those people who rush into things and it wouldnt be safe to do that .
she can always do that sort of thing .
folliat who had known her long and intimately had spoken of her as someone not quite normal , who needed care and watchfulness .
all fair and above board .
how many keys are there to the front door ?
but i think if we go on being silly long enough , some gem of great price might come out of it , concealed among the rubbish , as you might say .
he sat down on the edge of a chair , thinking for a minute or two , and then spoke in a quiet , level voice .
orourkes smile .
oh no , darling .
no one can touch you .
doctors are rather like that , said bridget .
these young fellows , they get violent in their feelingsand so do the older ones .
as the days succeeded each other we had all grown more and more on edge .
percival dreadfully .
as i told you , i went out to make a telephone call .
i began to think about my baby that died .
betty wasnt the confiding sort anyway .
but in all probability it is thrown on top of a bookcase , or inside a china jar .
lord kidderminster interposed quickly : we mustnt force the chief inspectors hand .
on arriving there , freda had a brief conversation with her landlady .
as i tell you , we were hardly ever alone , never confidential together .
ill go away , inspector .
would it make things worse ?
your wits are not so sharp as those of a mere servant girl .
they do send them to you usually .
then , of course , it was quite easy for him , in his role of medical attendant , to poison off alfred crackenthorpe and also to send the tablets to harold in london , having safeguarded himself by telling harold that he wouldnt need anymore tablets .
the nickname was an affectionate one and had been accepted as such by the girl herself .
satterthwaite , a patron of art and the drama , a determined but pleasant snob , always included in the more important house parties and social functions (the words and mr .
was that the compulsion ?
oh , to cora , and to uncle frank , i suppose , and uncle andrew .
never read it before ?
poirot thanked her , bought two postcards , a book of stamps and a piece of local pottery .
please continue to sit as you are sittingwithout looking round .
orourke and miss minton , she imparted the contents of the letter , and enlarged freely on the personality of aunt gracie , her indomitable spirit , her indifference to air raids and danger , and her vanquishment by illness .
he said : weve got to forget the pastcant dwell on the past .
blore said : theres a little stair here .
no , mademoiselle , i am not at all sure !
' we found this in the pocket of the dead woman ' s dress .
and everybody has been most kind to memr .
sixty , you knowyes , i should say at least sixty .
what else do you suggest ?
and between these two walked moira scott who , until three months ago , had been moira oconnell .
i bet she doesnt spend a tenth part of her incomewhat has she got to spend it on , anyway ?
i suppose hes left his savings by will to someone ?
many crime writers appeared regularly in the pages of the multitude of magazines availableconan doyle and sherlock holmes , chesterton and father brown , bailey and mr .
theres nothing mysterious or out of the way about that .
it had been little changed in its furnishing or arrangements .
and ericsson what about ericsson ?
) the two men stood in the porch , chattingfixing up another match for next saturday .
the answers never are what you think they will be .
he was glad to forget it when the day was over .
following mahmoud , she climbed the rock and walked along until she came to the squat figure in the chair , touched the puffy hand , felt for the pulse , bent over her when she straightened herself she was paler .
van aldin speak of him in very high terms .
so all had turned out well , or so you thought .
shes close on forty if shes a day , and she must know all about life there is to know .
they got into the lift and descended to the floor below .
she had been afraid some such thing had happened to her .
yes , that is betterbut not quite large enough .
the solemn child will be standing in a green grass fairy ring by a monkey puzzle holding a hoop .
the case will come up probably within three months .
he wouldnt have come here .
that is nothing .
gave em a sensation !
what about the waiters ?
moreover , she had assured me solemnly that there was nothing of that kind between her and laurence and i felt more inclined to believe her than to believe that malicious gnome josephine .
you wear gloves , of course , she told them , so as not to leave fingerprints on anything .
but in my opinion that open window is a blind .
but now it seems as though that mightnt be so .
guess ill be going along now .
she seemed to have a beaming and boundless good will .
_num_ size .
one of these laboursaving gimmicks .
the proposition that i was putting before you was of quite a different nature .
so unusual nowadays .
gretas done everything to help us .
mary mead i should say .
instead , in an old-fashioned manner , he pressed the bell and waited for that admirable factotum , george , to open the door .
she had an uncle or something of the sort out there who offered her a home .
i remember he stressed respectability too .
asked raymond .
could the theory that hercule poirot believed to be true account for and explain all those facts ?
so you have returned to usand not alone , i hear .
a verdict of death by misadventure was brought in .
we know everything here .
it had been , he remembered , a long epistle , breathing mingled passion and despair .
the applicant proved to be a rude-looking carter well coated with mud .
ever since mr .
it was to be tonight .
then sir claud called me back into the study for something .
helens letters ?
no , monsieur , i put on a few clothes .
the girl hesitated a moment by the bed .
poirot said gently : cette pauvre madame doyle .
you see , someone told me the other day a most amusing story .
david and goliath .
at the station she signalled a taxi and asked to be taken to yewtree lodge .
your conclusions are , i think , justified , he said .
leave the island before it is too late .
not entirely .
just lately mr .
you believe that ?
jan turned his back on her , and walked away .
why are we going to call on the duke of merton ?
he still is .
i remembered the clouds of steam which had gushed from the hot tap of the one bathroom styles had originally possessed , one of those bathrooms in which an immense bath with mahogany sides had reposed proudly in the middle of the bathroom floor .
so dont you worry , mrs hailsham-brown , she assured her .
katherine made no reply to this filial observation , and lenox presently went on : i am rather like chubby .
though obviously very upset , she at once showed that she was capable and intelligent .
that is rather a good idea , said tuppence .
that suggested camouflage .
' _num_ ' he is very sound .
i can help you along to the dining-car or bring meals along to you , and get things done for you .
i found myself in what was the obviously humiliating position of having only had one child , and that a daughter .
suppose she gets cold feet and doesnt turn up after all ?
really , said her husband , i should have thought that that was not at all characteristic of you .
to be under the thumb of ones family like thatit was really rather ridiculousespecially for a man !
and always one must be reasonable .
a sherlock holmes crime !
nobody , indeed , could have been more unlike .
we didnt need her to tell us so !
it was a subdued little troop that negotiated the descent and listened halfheartedly to the guides descriptions and information .
although his eyes were still on the ceiling , he managed to see the dark flush that rose to derek ketterings face .
she said with a sudden rush : what happens when you are dead ?
and in high good humour major bletchley wheeled about at the end of the parade and set the pace for a smart walk back to breakfast at sans souci .
you think shes the wrong type for him ?
' i found it just now - where i looked for it - in m .
as to your wife , you will go straight back to her and tell her the truthor at least a portion of it .
the person it so often is , he said softly ; the husband .
he was to give away the prizes , said mrs .
really , when i bend over sometimes i fear that i shall never get up again .
behind the cold blue eyes of that mary was a strangera stranger he did not know .
finishing her coffee rapidly , barbara seemed to realize that a change of mood was called for .
jane was in , and after telephoning , the clerk informed us that we were to go up .
it was quite unexpected .
dyou hear ?
who said he blackmailed me ?
twenty-five i came to myself slowly and painfully .
they even came to the house with a search warrant .
half an hour ago you were all for henrys going to the grange .
lomax , said the drawling voice of mr .
another friend claimed attention .
they think that they can deceive anyone but that no one can deceive them .
no , i dont say that .
he was shaking with rage .
hope it will last .
afterwards , when we went into the common room colin went off somewhere .
lawton , that sheila hasnt telephoned .
her parents are dead .
i think there was a very careful plan made .
presumably not .
in appearance he was quite undistinguished , he might have been a business man from the midlands .
very interesting names in them , too .
the whole proceedings had been purely formal .
then he turned to me with twinkling eyes .
both eve and leathern can submit to as much searching as anyone pleases .
attemptedeh ?
no , vincent , this isnt what you think .
emma crackenthorpe smiled .
even for sentiments sake i have not kept any of them .
perhaps he hoped the valet wouldnt notice the stain ?
lacy , and dr .
you see , he needed the money very badly .
personally , if i were you , i shouldnt mention it to her .
im always going back to the old days and the old faces .
he passed over in his mind the evidence of one servant after anotherthe information was extraordinarily meagre .
hes made quite a good deal of money off and on by rather doubtful means .
how are you , gerda dear ?
ah , yes , i remember now .
i expect youre a catholic , but its whats written on their tombstone .
someone might have suggested that she should come out and meet them somewhere outside .
mon ami , for some reason it was imperative that the crime should seem to have taken place later than it actually did .
i put the idea out of my head as quickly as possible .
he did not fancy that giuseppe would be anxious for a second encounter that night .
does crump mrs .
dennis ?
he returned with the brandy for poirot , who accepted it with a nod of satisfaction , and george then proceeded to provide the teetotal refreshment that was the only thing likely to appeal to mrs .
here , i said , here you see where it sweeps down to the sea and where the rocks show out there .
could it be because the breeches were not torn and the puttees were non-existent ?
your ring , he said .
the one mrs .
and because of a little what you might call girl trouble arousing jealousy and various emotions , he was knifed one night and died .
they descended to the garage , where a nervous-looking young man with a curious lack of chin and an agreeable smile greeted them with a vague haw , haw , haw !
just for a moment katherine fancied that poirot looked disappointed .
henet paused triumphantlythen a qualm seemed to pass over her , and she visibly cringed a little , glancing nervously at esa .
giving me orders .
ghastly old bore , said mr .
she turned her head half sideways , looking at the old man lying back in the chair .
charles lampton .
but i really do think that tonight will see the clearing up of the mystery .
it stared me in the face .
it was something i had smelt before .
some doctor told him he had cancer and he killed himself .
that was really most remarkable .
would i be in london ?
morley passed slowly from tooth to tooth , tapping and probing , murmuring little comments as he did so .
how near were any of you to that desk ?
she hustled poor old tommy so much that he finally invited a friend of his to live permanently with thema colonel wallensteinalways said by the surrounding county to be mrs matthews second husband .
he added , his curiosity getting the better of him , id like to know why you ask that ?
it was his thought again now .
oh , i suppose it could be done , said tuppence .
there was a pause and then raymond said , his voice now quietly matter-of-fact : you do agree , carol ?
hes been in gaol twice .
hercule poirot was quick to lead the conversation away .
something in her voice made both men look at her sharply .
it is clear in my mind and i think it is clear in yours the occasion when we last met .
i will accept with pleasure to drink a cup of chocolate this afternoon .
all her letterstalking about aunt gracie and the garden and everything .
he took from his pocket an unmounted print .
not at the time .
there , said rhoda as anne came back into the room after shutting the door after battle .
he alters the hands of the clock to the same time as the letterknowing that it is always kept a quarter of an hour fast .
he paced seven steps carefully , and bending down examined the ground .
two english ladies .
there had been some troublenobody knew exactlythough rumours had been spread about .
i want more than pushing an old woman over a quarry .
satterthwaites eyes .
surely that must be it !
she escapes from reality into fantasy .
the experiment was clearly not popular .
i cried , surprised .
clearly the man in front of him felt no incongruity in speaking thus of a woman who on the day after had deliberately killed her husband .
all their stories dovetailed and checked .
an ordinary life and an orderly deathof coursethat was itthat was what was missing !
of course he was very well-preserved and all that and in full possession of his faculties oh yes .
poirot , did you she stopped .
oh , he told you about it , did he ?
on this occasion i rather fancy they have helped to put a rope round a mans neck your neck , dr lorrimer .
hallo , it said .
he said : nonsense , old girl ; youve been dreaming .
and theres reason to believe that the woman was edmund crackenthorpes widow .
broadribb said no more for the moment .
if you bring it in the proper mezzo key , yes , you shall learn it .
i believe ii saw a pictureat some exhibition , she added hurriedly .
joyce turned to dr .
there seems only one thing to be done , said tommy .
it might have been miss williams room or my room .
deep scorn in the friends voice .
you thought i had fallen for the siren ?
there are two lovely moulded ceilings and the rooms are a beautiful shape .
as he was driven through the night , bound on his errand , a curious smile came to mr .
what does it matter whether i was out for a walk or not ?
the police are looking for ellis .
but we mustnt be uncharitable .
goaded to a dull fury , a blind rage .
as it is , they always glower at one so and bite their nails and seem to have so many spots and sometimes an adams apple as well .
men are not born equalto offset the natural inequality of nature one must redress the balance .
could you kindly explain ?
dash it all , aunt jane , said raymond , dont spoil all the romance .
voillet us examine the facts .
anne , you cant possibly suspect i do .
but tell me now your own ideas and theories .
it was to armstrong that he spoke and armstrong replied : of course .
egg talked about loomouth .
so now , said calgary , we can discuss it calmly , cant we ?
schuster , glancing at the clock as he did so .
and she knows something else about her son .
that was a nasty business .
oliver thought very hideous , mounted to the sky with a square matchbox-like air .
she doesnt trust me .
thibault has got an appointment this evening , so i suggest that we should start by consulting him on any point that seems likely to be useful .
once she said : i think youre right about spain .
my dear , he exclaimed , do you see what shes got on ?
im glad you like it .
trust her to keep her feet on the earth .
she hadnt a lot of stuffonly the one case .
chapter _num_ croydon the steward and the doctor were no longer in charge of the situation .
murmured poirot to himself .
those pencilled words showed that she was on the track but that was dangeroushorribly dangerous .
when the alarm went off we pushed mathew in his carry-cot underneath a solid papier-mache table with a thick glass top , as the heaviest thing we could find to put him under .
one takes , of course , too much for granted .
come in , sirmr .
just about , said gwenda .
then , turning to me , he said authoritatively : nurse , i should be much obliged if you would tell m .
maybe youre right .
theres no evidence to the contrary .
the trouble with you and me , mike , is that we dont live in the real world .
poirot said : yes ?
after all deaths do occasionally occur at studio parties .
not all the time , of course , but quite often .
oh no , theyre not , i said , turning over the papers .
i cant lose henrietta !
on one side of it was a long sprawling building of mudbrick .
actually i was very wide of the mark .
tennysons idylls of the king .
we did so .
she went slowly back to the house uneasy in her mind .
in a moment , as it were , he became a different person .
with a temperature of _num_ , any complication seemed to me quite unnecessary and absurd .
and so i was doing thati wasnt really looking , if you know what i mean i know what you mean , said mrs .
there must be norepetition .
believe , chre madame , all the assurances of my most devoted and unaltered sentiments armand de la rochefour .
yes , perhaps , if she were not half starved .
you are angryyou are sore , and all because i am practical .
he was the opposite of his brother in almost every respect , being unusually shy and reserved .
i was wondering about youwhat you are really like .
immediately she was all animation .
not a very efficacious pattern , that ?
) did you ever see the lady who is sawn in half ?
with the greatest of ease .
im getting a bright young lad to carry this to you .
and that was about twenty-five past five and mrs .
the lorry decanted them at the tio hotel and then went off with the cook and the driver to do all the necessary shopping .
the murderer slips on gloves .
my tenants are a contented lot .
she was not made-up , or if she was it was so light and delicate that it did not show .
we were a very ordinary young couple , but we were happy .
the day after our installation was a sunday .
practical as they make em , thought inspector neele .
then he rose , cleared away any traces of disorder , emptied the ashtrays and straightened the chairs .
youll have to stop with us , mr .
but she was saved all trouble on this score .
that might have been just a pin-up hero , mightnt it ?
he decided that it was against she paused a minute and turned to look at the man in the chair .
half a pound of mushrooms , chicken stock , milk , a roux of butter and flour , and lemon juice .
seemed all as right as rain .
we are up against somebody who has already struck twicethat person will not hesitate to strike again .
it comes to thisare you going to work with me or against me , hastings ?
roberts heart leaped with excitement .
and she sounded as though she did see .
since doyle is all right theres no reason i shouldnt come along and resume our talk of this afternoon .
what silly nicknames people have cocker spaniels do you remember darling susie , edmund ?
get em on the run .
neds proud of itsays it gives the house a tone .
he said : hullo , theres a box up here .
i feel better .
well manage lots of things .
gave her the slip in debenhams .
oh well , said ellie .
id better join the queue quickly .
do you know anything against him ?
veronal ?
then he asked : ' where were mrs farley and miss farley at the time of the death ?
the coroner continued : you went to see the deceased on saturday evening ?
proficient as he was in details of the santa f boundary dispute , he had no wish to stand an examination on it this minute .
giles , id be obliged if youd go down and send up the housekeeper .
megan barnard _num_ .
you look all in .
no , said ann thoughtfully , i dont think i do .
yes , hes clever .
the door opened and jason looked in .
bundle looked at her in sudden suspicion .
but , poirot , the compliment !
no , no , its just i forgot to tell you that ive got a present for you , aunt matilda .
oui , cest moi .
here was molly alive and wandering about .
she moved backwards ; sheshe stepped back off the edge !
he dared not go out .
it will be a great ordeal for you , but if it succeeds it will make such a difference to your life that it will be worth anything you suffer .
well , i mean , the way weve been looking at it .
poirot smiled but did not answer .
not quicklynothing happens quicklybut at any rate we can hope .
id say she ought to lie down right now in a darkened room .
she left it in her will to me .
oliver often thought of it to herself , though usually at cocktail and not literary parties because she seldom went to the latter .
he said in a low awe-struck whisper : my god !
miss bunner with her mouth open and mrs .
yes , who live here ?
she was the only person to alight at the tiny station of matchings halt .
not murder , i hope ?
i said , i do not quite understand , sir .
here , propped up in a big shabby leather chair sat an old gentleman with a white walrus moustache .
but having seen something , or heard something , she may have mentioned the fact quite unsuspiciously .
thats my advice , but the obstinate old fool wont hear of it .
miss debenham may have told you , perhaps , that i overheard some words spoken to you at the station of konya ?
you know major blunt , mr .
he then left the hotel and went to the merchants bank in victory square where he cashed a cheque .
one does get bored .
but it is not the property of anyone in this house , sir .
he rose and took her hand in his .
no , my dear girl , walk into a trap with my eyes open .
beyond making certain that life was extinctan easy matteri have not disturbed the body in any way .
that is the wrong way to bring anything back .
nobody would hear a shot , for instance , on a night like this .
poirot left the villa rubbing his hands in great satisfaction .
terry darling , what are we going to do ?
but the dimness was not gloomy for some peculiar reason .
if you will ring up and make an appointment , i will leave instructions with my secretary .
there mustnt be a suspicion that weve got any idea of the motive for the crime .
tuppence got up .
one can put them behind you and get on a bit .
you didnt murder lady esther , but you thought you might be accused of doing so .
he strolled into the library , tearing it open .
bessner retained the quiet mr .
i suppose it cant very well run away if its never been there at all .
patrick redfern went with her .
you think milly jean cortman is ambitious ?
anything that can help us to do so may be valuable .
i wasnt fond of my father .
a tea set of largish cups and saucers , each one of a different colour .
it doesnt make sense at all .
im through !
before my time .
nothing quite so crude as thatbut you see the idea .
' what about this man on the terrace ?
a very ostentatious house , said mrs .
ill have men detailed .
seems tame , but i suppose thats it , agreed the other .
and suddenly , a queer nebulous idea began to take shapean idea suggested by that pair of innocent boots that stood there dumbly on the floor .
victoria was always delighted when she was about to take up a new job .
here , mademoiselle , is a notebook and a pencil for the shorthand .
that explains it .
didnt want a doctor .
edith pagett shook her head .
it is , how do you say , the box of surprises ?
orourke nodded her head several times , looking just like an obese china mandarin that tuppence remembered on her aunt gracies mantelpiece .
she struck the childthe babyflung a paperweight at her .
somewhat pleased with himself and the care he had taken over his travelling arrangements by booking a hotel beforehand , the canon abandoned his curry , remembered to pay for it , and strode out once more into the cromwell road .
youve neglected me a great deal for the last year .
even dr .
not in this fog .
you mean that you would prefer to relinquish the money ?
the colour crept into her cheeks and her lips parted .
she said , youre mikes mother , arent you ?
henry !
satterthwaite slowly , its a possible one , isnt it ?
she jerked her head sharply as a wasp flew past .
he played the torch carefully over the floor .
fact !
she has good average speed and is tolerably well-educated .
mortimer smiled a little .
percival a special service to oblige her .
he was following out a train of thought in his mind .
ive got a racking head still , and ive been nearly squeezed to death by you .
cyril quain out .
poirot laid his jesting manner aside .
sheppard ?
things do , you know .
rose was taken aback .
about half an hour before the bell went for lunch , sir .
if your book runs to more than that i think you will usually find that it would have been better if it had been shorter .
can you tell me the whole story ?
he took my hand in his and almost mechanically i drew it away .
all she saw was that she might go to prison for a robbery she had committed years ago .
said nurse davis .
mary mead is overpopulated with suspects .
roger ackroyd dictated his wishesthey agreed to them .
they have won the first trick ; but they have failed in their plan to get me out of the way , and in the future they have to reckon with hercule poirot !
we were detained under suspicion by the hospital porter , until cynthia appeared to vouch for us , looking very cool and sweet in her long white overall .
we lay down and a chinese boy took off our boots .
so now we know where we are .
he gave a faint smile .
this , he told hastings , is a duplicate .
i understand what you mean .
you know the people who always have a noble and good reason to mask their meaner actions ?
why are you so interested in him ?
a boat difficult to get into if two strong and able boatmen had not practically lifted him in .
it seems to me she paused .
i rang the bell , and a rather seedy-looking man in an alpaca coat opened the door .
yes , i think that was the date .
he went on : that is how the matter stands , renisenb .
he still went to the club , spent his summer days at the cricket ground , came back with amusing storieswas the same kindly personality .
she was mentally applauding her fathers descriptive powers .
dane calthrop , both you and ginger have already admitted the possibility of such a thing , or you wouldnt be doing what you are doing .
immediately after dinner , was richards reply .
im so shortsighted and you didnt give your name .
old and tired and ill .
there are tors that are said to pixy-ridden , and i expect that farmers coming home after a thick night still complain of being pixy-led .
fortunately our new house is almost ready to move into .
yours are labors of love .
he contented himself with saying : ' and where do i come in , monsieur ?
his glance wandered appreciatively over the huge chairs , the big desk and the indirect lighting .
major burnaby was thinking of the snow .
and the crime would be put down as an ordinary train robbery .
it seemed to jimmy that his words deserved an answer , but ronny continued to stare straight out in front of him .
i told you that she is a lady well known in society .
satterthwaite , slowly .
you dont suspect foul play there , surely ?
asked raymond , curiously .
we can marry now , sophia .
some day , i expect , i shall see him again .
ive fallen in love with a very charming girl and am naturally impatient to marry her .
poirot had been going towards the door .
the colour surged up in his cheeks and i realized then how very white he had been before .
its not much of a road , is it ?
that dog of yours nearly made me take the most frightful toss .
shell be a rich woman , too , when mr .
edward ferrier said : all right , george .
you came over on the carmanic , i believeat least so madame doyle was telling me .
the bananas arent so bad ; you get a bit of fun out of themcriminals slipping on the skin .
down below , in the narrow way between the house and the factory , he saw a small dark object .
anyway mrs .
raymond said hurriedly : it was a way i read in a bookan english detective storyyou stuck an empty hypodermic syringe into someone and it did the trick .
this is mathew .
satterthwaite looked at the slender white-clad figure in some admiration .
poirot threw up his hands in a very french fashion .
(no , shed never do that !
near hounslow .
in all probability she was still in the neighbourhood of south audley mansions .
she lived in a slum somewhere .
it is of no matter , said poirot .
there were four exits from the librarytwo doors , two windows ; but evidently only one would do .
youre not used to living in the country , mr .
did you approach her guardian ?
then i will at least pull your nose for you .
take it away .
she spoke from the window of the pretentious half-timbered building .
good indeed !
crale suggested they might like some iced beer .
well , what about number two ?
its always like that !
good day , monsieur .
and he never sees journalists .
like as two peas , him and the capting , he murmured .
james bentley was thinking objectively .
had stayed on with mr .
tuesday , november fifth , said japp .
that is why you are making the call .
i really couldnt believe my ears when i heard the police had arrested him .
lord whitfield was telling me how hed been to the wellerman instituteand seen such a lot of germs and cultures and bacteriait quite made me shiver .
asked colonel johnson .
if she isnt about , look for her .
crale and angela warren brought them out beer there .
there were times , she had to admit as the years were growing upon her , when she couldnt remember them all .
babbington drink it by mistake ?
but i understand from her maid that it was on the _num_ .
i have been at yewtree lodge just over a year .
satipy ?
its bill , she said .
beneath an assortment of ties lay a pile of biscuits .
he didnt visit any of his old associates but he visited an elderly woman , a mrs .
lovebody & slickerthe same kind of sale bills and forthcoming auctions in their rather grimy windows .
why did anyone do it ?
and people will cold shoulder the bantrys and avoid them .
there were the usual greetings , nods of the head , evening , sir .
you have , i suppose , no sirop ?
there were a fair sprinkling of english and other nationalities , but the majority of the dancers were spanish ; and when the orchestra struck up a tango , only half a dozen couples of the latter nationality took the floor .
bob shrugged his shoulders .
as startled eyes turned to him the door opened and mrs .
genir at nancy , both imploring that you will continue to sit for them occasionally .
a faint shadow seemed to ruffle the serenity of nadine boyntons face .
' this is where we get official .
on the night of mrs .
not reallyi just heard her name mentioned once or twice , but it was ages ago .
perhaps quite soon .
just curiosity , i know , he added apologetically .
anyway , nobody was killed , thank goodness .
perhaps in the near future ?
just in time he remembered that sir bartholomew had been a friend of sir charles cartwrights and was duly appalled by the callousness of the sentiments he had nearly revealed .
perhaps its lawrence .
she came back to the bureau .
you have children , seora ?
brought them chocs down from london .
im sure they wouldnt like dogs there .
its a german make .
round the first corner to the rightthen to the leftright again .
perhaps she went to see her stepdaughter , or her stepdaughter came home for a weekend .
luke shuddered slightly .
naturally , i do not expect to find the will amongst them , but it is likely that some apparently innocent paper may conceal the clue to its hiding place .
the menu for mr .
well , i heard her say it , but i didnt really listen .
i think they met each other again therei mean my father and mother .
i suppose he would have had this murder put down to him as a certainty .
you dont know what it may lead to .
am i to tell caroline of this ?
yes , what is it ?
she clung to tuppence beseechingly .
he was very secretive about it all , said magdalene .
when i heard that it was red narky , who always worked with gracie kiddwell , i knew just where to find her .
that fact would be known to anyone , i take it ?
the husband and wife worked out a scheme whereby marlene should be killed and lady stubbs disappear in conditions which should throw vague suspicion on paul lopez .
the others drew back while he made his examination .
i always did mean to marry you , darling .
i know youve got a bee in your bonnet about young frank carter .
well , i have some ideas , said miss marple .
no milk , i suppose ?
its not nonsense .
the latter read it with some interest .
did sir bartholomew mention a mrs .
protheroe passed my garden , as i told you , and she went as far as the study window and she looked in and she didnt see colonel protheroe .
he took both her hands in his .
who would ever have dreamt of such a thing ?
really , the havoc these young women cause !
she didnt like that hook on the ceiling .
why , thats quite all right , partridge , said joanna soothingly , why shouldnt your friends use the phone if they want to speak to you ?
its probably broken up adhesions in the brain .
newspapers and letters .
that is where you were all wrong .
poor little rich girl ooph !
i insisted on coming back the following weekend to see how she was .
besh hadha ?
they left the countrythey went to the new worldabroadto the dominionsto start a new life .
i took it that id paid for that right through , but it seems that its only paid until cairo .
i pulled off the lid , and a stream of dull glassy pebbles rolled on to the bed .
dr gerard hastily raised his hat .
satterthwaite counted over on his fingers the times he had been brought into contact with that man of mystery .
everyone was talking of possible expeditions , and making plans to visit the middle east .
a tall middle-aged manservant waited on them with the professional deftness of a waiter .
unless brenda goes on living in it .
it was colonel melchett .
franklin said : please go , bill , im terribly tired .
mersu nodded approval .
he looked so desperate and defeated that evelyns heart smote her .
it is reported that even his own followers are ignorant of it .
he moved to the door and the others followed him .
findeyson had been ordered to egypt or some such place for the winterall tomfoolery .
i didnt mean no harm , said mrs .
she was an unwanted and unloved child .
what i do believe , and believe without a doubt , is this , he leaned forward , wagging a forefinger impressively , thyrza grey does knowbeforehandwhen someone is going to die .
' some people would say undoubtedly the latter .
mrs hailsham-brown is young and attractive .
ohnowell , if its as you say , i must have made a mistake .
and confusion to castles select tours .
just sitting and waiting .
sweeneys got the key if you want to go over itnext to the post office .
blunt did some foreign business , i believe .
but , yes , i know that captain marsh was with the dortheimers .
he was a tall , spare man with a thin face and grey hair .
unless , of course , paul bennett had left it that way in his will .
im leaving tomorrow , said ellie .
youre wrong then , because i cant , replied the other .
' ' oh , yes .
but there would still be the problem of the disposal of the body , he pointed out .
mother , cried flora , you dont think ralph did it ?
their names are unknown , but they are presumed to be chileans from santiago .
where were mrs farley and miss farley ?
how nice to see you again .
jesmond , but christmas in england is a great institution and i assure you at kings lacey you would see it at its best .
' again a flicker of amusement .
shes disarranged all my books .
starkwedder looked across at laura .
the same thingonly jinny is in lightwhere she was in darkness and from opposite , ginevra said unexpectedly : poor mothershe was queernowthat were all so happyi feel kind of sorry for her .
poirot , you mean old mrs .
if you like to write for yourself only , that is a different matteryou can make it any length , and write it in any way you wish ; but then you will probably have to be content with the pleasure alone of having written it .
hes not a bad sort really , and things upset him .
winnie gave a scream of laughter .
take no unnecessary risks once the papers are in your hands .
yes , said lynn with spirit .
he meant to shoot you and when hed missed , he shot himself .
you were quite right , of course , but if wed bluffed you out in no other way , mademoiselle , could the thing have happened .
three the manhood of edward robinson the manhood of edward robinson was first published as the day of his dreams in grand magazine , december _num_ .
eastney knew .
the letter written to me in great distress of mind .
he thought her kind , but a little overpowering .
every place gets ruined sooner or later .
and the choice suddenly presented itself to her in the simplest termsthe easy life or the difficult one .
that is all !
has he got an appointment ?
leadbetter in a last touch of poetical fancy .
he rose from his chair and went to norma .
grants voice broke into his musings .
ah yes , romantic .
well , so nancy has carted you down here got a bee in her bonnet about the secretary .
lepers !
the ticket collector looked as though he thought mrs .
outside it was still snowing .
poirot was talking animatedly to the stout lady who was serving him .
philip blake says here she had her head screwed on too well to meddle with poison , but i dont think thats true at all .
that finished it !
new partner !
he stayed a little while considering , then he said very gently : cant you tell me why ?
so i pretended to swallow his statements , and let him come .

at my suggestion , we adjourned to the study after tea and i looked over the papers in question .
its certainly the first time ive had an assignment of that kind .
if so , of course , she must have been dashed to pieces on the rocks below .
but she had never thought of the woman in connection with the child , could not understand it now .
then , rising , she hurried from the room .
it was a mans sneeze , said mrs .
he was a good-looking young man , tall and fair , with a round chin and very round eyes .
lady stubbs came out of the house with mrs .
in a way ive told it you already , but i dont suppose really you realize it .
yes , you were working in the garden and were so polite as to say good afternoon when we passed .
satterthwaite stole softly away .
especially since you had been to see her in paris the night before , and had had something of a scene with her ?
yes , the nice one aunt ada liked .
you nippy old devil !
seddon polished his eyeglasses .
observe that crescent ; and those diamondstheir neatness rejoices the eye .
after all this time !
shes been in the divorce court a good deal .
ive seen too much of your work .
and yetit seemed more than that .
his wife was always on the watch .
just caught me .
you can relieve your feelings by the expedient of the printed word .
bridget went straight to the drawing room , luke close behind her .
in the doorway of the stag he met rowley cloade and lynn marchmont .
katherine found her own bed prepared , and since she was tired , she went to bed and switched off her light about half past nine .
i want to help .
that is exactly what i am doing !
she is showing signs of mental breakdown .
beresford , and have a look round .
it seemed there were twoa mrs .
andand there wasnt anything wrong about it .
he realized that strange had quite another meaning from the bald one the words conveyed .
beautiful as the rug was , it hardly seemed to me to necessitate such close attention .
ted ?
she pointed to the panel .
she had brought personality to her pictures rather than mere sex .
oh , i wouldnt say that , colonel melchett , said miss marple .
prestcottcolonel melchett tended towards a blunt brutality .
that charles had nothing to do with this wicked murder !
hadnt everything been done for him always ?
canon pennyfather did come back to the hotel that night .
yes , two years ago , at easter .
but she must know the pictures quite well if shes living in the house .
age at a guess , twenty-five , big and rather ungainly in his movements , a pleasantly ugly face , a splendid set of white teeth and a pair of honest brown eyes .
she had looked at her friend , miss barrow , rather as though she were seeking instruction as to what to say .
i think youre wrong , you know , loraine .
sound as a bell , so they say , cherry said .
formerly abernethie .
she showed me the ring , allowed me to satisfy myself that it was genuine , thereby disarming suspicion on my part .
just madenice and strong !
cant we get the police or something ?
with the police ?
no , and i dont believe it .
your nose is very sensitive .
elinor said slowly : so thats why she was so upset last nightand in such a panic that you should be sent for .
it would mean taking william from the lower border , mlady .
hell probably come back and haunt them .
' lord mayfield sounded a trifle incredulous .
cresswell , the slice of cod .
she left the bazaar before the holdup began , and arrived in london in her car .
you know , i cant help feeling happy , in spitein spite of everything .
im not excited , jan insisted .
he repeated the conversation he had held with jefferson cope .
it sleeps on the premises .
frightened of what she was going to do , frightened of the plan going wrongbut not frightened enough to draw back .
halfway down this top flight was a rather awkwardly placed window .
finally , with a satisfied sigh , he closed it , and came back to his position in the centre of the room .
and you like it here ?
ah , well , said superintendent battle , patting her on the arm with a hand he disengaged from the wheel , and uttering one of his pet forms of trite consolation .
you know , hooliganism or whatever they call it .
a pardonable deception , do you not think ?
bunch opened her handbag .
what do you mean by quite the contrary ?
its a bull-dog drummond , and you are the inimitable carl peterson .
he then drove , as per schedule , straight to charing cross , where a special train for dover was awaiting him , and , after a brief account of what had happened had been given to the anxious police by captain daniels , he duly departed for france .
poirot described his meeting with the young man who had come up the path from the quay .
bulmer , i am sure , will make great play with that !
he had made love to her , he remembered , in a discreet elderly man-of-the-world fashion .
i am enjoying the air .
then you will preach tonight ?
they went down the stairs and along corridors and finally into a large dining room .
there are just three solutions of it .
if she could only remember that .
it suffices to say that it had its effect .
he was flying prince ali yusuf out from ramat and they crashed in the mountains .
you would not understand .
acknowledging the introduction , barbara asked , whats all the excitement , inspector ?
i suppose you saw me there , said giles .
no , i dont want caviare , i want something else .
the denial , he felt , had not rung quite true .
no , of course not , dolly .
and then , as i stood on the roof , going over in my mind those three points : the letters , the roof , the window , i sawjust as miss johnson had seen !
the recovery of the pearl is the great thing , mr .
one would always want , i suppose , to use ones own ideas , said eileen rich .
as i say , she books a room , saying that she is going by the night boat train to liverpool and that her luggage has gone on .
i think he is a malicious and tyrannical old man .
you look pale , he said accusingly .
eustace and josephine did lessons until half past twelvewith a break at half past ten .
he would have liked to have beaten her , to have clasped her in his arms , to have thrown her down on the floor and trampled on her , to have thrown himself at her feet .
i had no earthly reason to do so .
i comprehend your anxiety .
yes ; but i never went there on the following evening .
i thanked him enormously , said how kind his wife had been , but that i really felt it was better for me to go to the hotel , and that i had already made arrangements there .
was first published in the usa in cosmopolitan , april _num_ , and then as on the orient express in nashs pall mall , june _num_ .
the tea was very gooda nice strong blendnot like the weak china stuff that mrs .
they were only a rather more pronounced assessment of possibilities that i had already gone through on the coach .
they did not want sympathy , they wanted practical help .
i mean , it was all very worrying , and made one most uncomfortable .
jimmy listened with a show of sympathy and at last managed to detach himself without actual rudeness .
in what wayodd ?
the ladies , he explained .
it fitted in with his knowledge of audreyof her instinct for perfection .
no , im sure i shant .
did you know that might happen ?
a faintly disapproving note had entered the assistants voice .
yet perhaps their case was different from mine .
i left my wife on her account .
he had faded blue eyes , a thin melancholy nose , and a vague but courteous manner .
and so we come to this afternoon .
at the bottom of the garden the bushes parted slightly .
miss amory gave a shriek , barbara exclaimed , crikey !
its true , my sweet .
he is still very young .
i mean the baldwen-white face .
crump and to her husband .
besides , its a lovely day and theyre sure to be out .
it was thought inadvisable .
remove one page , and the letter is capable of being twisted into a damning accusation of another mana man too who has a motive for lord edgwares death .
taking my scores to ashfield , i used to play them in the evenings in the school-room , (also an icy cold room in winter) .
i know , sirbut its an unsatisfactory picture .
evil entered into their hearts .
imhotep went on : you have accused her , i understand , of stealing a boxa jewel box .
interesting it had been , and in the end rewarding , because he had found out the truth .
gerald wright continued to smile in a superior fashion .
rafiel , you would enjoy that .
terry licked her cheek delicately .
i cant help that , said vole earnestly .
i will confess that i then had a moment of doubtof myself .
i have no authority to go through these papers .
copleighs wilder suppositions as to child murderers sir philip starke comes in as a very valuable source of information , said ivor smith .
not at all , not at all , said the other .
your name and your address and then she says to jim and now you write your name underneath there , and your address too .
two hundred guineas .
he said : if youre saying that i tampered with that , ill knock your ruddy block off .
she had been grateful to him , passionately grateful , for understanding so well , and had been torn with pity for him , seeing him suddenly turn into an old man .
a countor was it a marquis ?
she said gently : i hope you are enjoying yourself down here .
not a servant , said esa , they would not dare .
then he asked : did you notice a calendar in her room ?
melodramatic , lost to all sense of proportion .
but theyll try ?
what a disgraceful waste of money , just for for for kissproof , aunt caroline .
we will see what we can do .
i call it very interestingvery interesting indeed .
but from what you tell me , there doesnt seem to be any possible lead there .
for a second time , poirot stood gazing up at a portrait .
and he urged me to take gwenda home and give her brandy after we were at the police station when lily kimble was killed .
and some of those little scones you make so nicely .
the car moved off down the drive , roger still standing on the step looking after it .
he said he wouldnt mind really if he died before the house was finished , but i told him , added ellie , that he mustnt die before the house was finished because i wanted him to see us live in it .
as soon as possible , said elaine .
and then i found shed left it all to me !
theyre about people who arent therethey dont really happen .
so we havent got much time , said inspector bland gloomily .
i mean if you could spare the time .
she probably put that in out of her head .
sir henry said : what did you say when conway told you he proposed to adopt the girl ?
i tell you by and by .
not quite black masses but that sort of thing .
bantrys in a pleading horror .
blunts pad and pencil .
vera sounded surprised .
' ' eh bien , me , i am the maid .
david picked them up and handed them to her .
why do you look at me like thatas though you couldnt believe ?
then she heard her voice saying : whoever did it wouldnt be hanging about .
pure lilac , a wonderfully fine flower , carried on exceptionally long and stiff stem .
goaded beyond endurance , inspector hardcastle rose to his feet .
one must go back , i feel , to the beginnings , to the early primitive powers .
you must give me up .
yes , mrs west .
im afraid , said tuppence , that you mustnt go out just now .
so very different from practice , isnt it ?
calgarywhy did he have to come and do this to her ?
you may have had some quite innocent reason for going there .
	chantry came back into the room .
simple as a b c .
a question is never settled until it is settledright .
his voice was curt and matter-of-fact .
what shall you tell the prince ?
what a fool ive been .
it consisted of a sitting room with a built-in cocktail bar , two bedrooms with built-in cupboards , and a superbly appointed bathroom , gleaming with tiles and chromium .
with it the past is never the pasti should imagine , madame , that to you the past unrolls itself , every incident clear as yesterday .
macqueen said merely , oh , yes ?
id like to see him , please .
hercule poirots eyes twinkled .
thank you so much for all you have shown me .
i was so hurt by this extremely unkind remark that i was quite incapable of replying , and judith went quickly away .
i had no book on hand at the moment .
then he got up from his seat .
' ' she ' s a wrong ' un all right , ' said sir george .
crispin , then came forward and lunged with all his might , growling furiously , at miss mullins .
explained why and so on .
put his dental plate in water and see that he had everything he wanted for the night .
she was tall and dark .
with his usual precautions against cold , he was muffled up to the ears .
all this can be fostered and strengthened from outside by those who are gifted by a natural power of leadership .
a school is for the children of today .
say the accusation is not true .
and yet miss de bellefort seemed to want to know .
granted that your uncle was a man of ability , his grey cells cannot have been of the quality of hercule poirots !
i feel absolutely full of pep and vim and bright ideas and a longing to dash out and do things .
try to understand , veronica .
and ill lock the door and take the key .
the laboratory reports on clothing added up to nil .
certainly notand there is no need to shout .
emily barton was a little dubious about mr .
all long ago .
yes , hes an extraordinary person .
strenuous bridge ?
somehow , affairs did not seem to be shaping themselves that way .
i went to the clarendon hotel , got a room , and went to bed .
hes had a strong hypodermic administered to him , said the doctor .
cried the baron .
good morning , miss .
uncle myless grandfather .
it was up to him to go carefully once more into the case against each one and make up his own mind .
it asked her , in suitable courteous and legal phraseology , to call upon them one day in the following week , at their office , to discuss a proposition that might be to her advantage .
there , alfred , theres your clue .
and about what i sawor think i sawin the hall ?
lancaster had become unknowingly involved .
sclrat !
ah , but it is ridiculousabsurd , what you say !
he pointed to a small dark stain on the floor .
raikes said : im not in the mood for small talk , jane .
i wanted to sit quietly and write my book .
that should be the motto of every christian man and woman .
written with a kind of artists pencil it was , and all of a sop though the paper was we managed to read it .
do you mean you have blackoutsthat sort of thing ?
mrs clappertons voice was shrill and penetrating .
i knowi know everything .
she freed herself quietly from his arm , and spoke over her shoulder .
after all after allwhat ?
one such prejudice was his music .
i heard a murmur of voices in the next room , and a minute later she came back and motioned us to pass into the adjoining room .
it was i who persuaded david to come here this christmas , to be reconciled to his father .
hubbard nodded thoughtfully .
her money had also been left to her in h .
yes , sir , said george .
as usual , i agreed .
it must have been something small .
the balmoral court was actually only about a hundred yards away , around one curve of the road .
perhaps she just wanted to be sensational , suggested tim .
i dont quite understand .
this does seem a very dirty job , said tuppence .
she saw jean dupont twice .
a thousand thanks , mademoiselle .
but he was not really deadah , no , they are never really dead , these supercriminals .
and he went on much in the same way as he had done to miss johnson , explaining how necessary it was that he should get a true picture of mrs .
heshes just awfully kind .
she pried , if you know what i mean , sir , poked and pried about .
i am afraid i have been a long time coming , m .
i remember tommy , too .
carstairs , said bobby , feeling that he had now established friendly relations and could get on with his job .
but , poirot , my dear fellow , you mustnt think of yourself as old , i protested .
elizabeth cole said suddenly , and once more the deep bitter note was in her voice : thats the depressing part of places like this .
he has a very good knowledge of english .
and you examined the breakthe edges were frayed ?
chilvers would not have seen anything wrong with the message , and like a good servant had carried out his orders faithfully enough .
iscould iis mrs .
and john franklin , too , has no use for divorce .
he coughed delicately .
how is that ?
so i have no business to feel certain .
an interesting angle of vision .
so many americans come and go .
i am inclined to agree with her .
im very interested in these views of yours , sir , said battle with a twinkle .
weve told all we know or saw .
avoid him as much as i could , he always sought me out and engaged me for a waltz .
oliver under her breath .
for sharper than a serpents tooth .
decidedly it is possible .
i hope you realize that .
he laughed and stuffed it into his pocket .
i did not reply , but yawneda delicate little yawn that hinted at intense boredom .
im afraid of being hanged .
plenty of decent young english fellows about .
you win , my dear , he said .
helen , said gwenda .
she went back hurriedly for the other tray with the eatables on it .
very aptly put , miss aldin .
mrs lemesurier was advancing towards us , her two children beside her .
i fancy he keeps a bicycle shop in time of peace , explained tuppence .
i went up to the path afterwards .
tonight , i stopped my wife from taking her usual dose .
com agatha christie cat among the pigeons a hercule poirot mystery contents cover title page prologue summer term _num_ .
ye-es , i admitted .
that didnt fit in at all .
and immediately , on that assumption , the whole case fell into beautiful shining order .
miss martindale ?
a lot of people had noticed them .
bill at once looked horribly embarrassed .
yes , that was very fortunatevery fortunate indeed .
its born in me .
perhaps , said audrey gravely , that is just as well .
the place became more of a wilderness every day , and was regarded as such in the neighbourhood .
he said : youve got to make her understand , m .
well painted and done up ?
hed have to stay .
to upset englandreally upset ityouve got to play hell with its financethats what it comes to !
of course you cant .
to have trusted someone !
percival said impatiently : yes , yes .
ikey hermanstein and co .
i had slept very badly the night before .
i expect you were busy .
and ive seen a good deal of torquil ericsson lately .
you see , im afraid youre not the only person onboard who knows that i am the man in the brown suit .
west india has come , and of course i suppose rushbridger does sound rather like west indiabut it was rather a coincidence her having just come from the west indies .
neither jane wilkinson nor carlotta adams wore glasses .
the evening post , sir , he said , handing the salver to ackroyd .
not just yet .
i can hear you sighing through the telephone .
it is a brave thing to do , for when you are caught , it isher voice broke a littlethe end .
it did not settle the point about the left-handedness .
everything o .
i just came down to spy out the land .
she shook her head , murmured , im all right , and leaned forward , her face between her hands .
quite right , said mrs .
tredwell was just examining the coffee pot .
no wonder , i thought , that bob despised miss lawson and refused to do anything she told him .
it was on my way down there that a sudden suspicion shot into my mind .
that is too self-confident a word .
the death of mr .
take them into the library , will you , beatrice ?
she also , quite frankly , liked money .
i made her promise not to go out on the balcony ; i said id had a dream .
her ears listened unconsciously for the chink of china , but there was no chink of china .
hm , i said , in oracular fashion .
sleuths on the doorstep rather suggest bombs in the attic , dont they ?
it can give one the best .
' not very much , monsieur .
she felt it over rapidly , then handed it back to him .
i admit that the case presented more difficulties than were at first apparent .
and there is one small vexing fact .
she murmured : you always believed in meyou always knew i could do great thingssway multitudes at a table not far away the hamlet of the evening was saying gloomily : her mannerisms !
shes in a good mood now and i dont want her disturbed .
you can go to dinner .
susan put her head on one side .
' ' it was not mrs vanderlyn in the drawing-room .
but i should say there is no doubtno doubt at all that the murderer came from outside .
we were out ourselves , remember .
but on the other hand , if it was true , its another point against fanequite a valuable point .
you couldnt , said japp .
poirot refused .
at last , putting his fears and doubts aside , he went to bed .
donovan and jimmy between them recounted the happenings of the evening .
listen , i want to tell you something .
enjoining caution , he led the way round the shed until we were out of ear-shot .
i suppose it doesin a way .
an elderly gardener , obviously employed to tend the graves of good citizens departed this life , approached poirot in the pleasurable hopes of a few minutes conversation while he laid his hoe and his broom aside .
your sophia , eustace , and josephine .
my dearest !
according to you everything is obvious .
has that house on the cliff next door to us .
they do , dont they ?
sometimes they stay a few hours , sometimes a day or two .
i saw it in the tube and tore it out .
its the most absurd idea .
snow was piled five feet high , drifting up against the doors and windows .
a proud peacock .
bantry , miss marple met colonel bantry coming along the drive , his gun in his hand and his spaniel at his heels .
henets sly triumph died .
baldwin in his turn looked up at the clock .
she had some moneyunder the floor .
i shall not let them meet unless i feel a sudden and unexpected urge to do so .
as far as that goes , she gave me the impression of being utterly frank .
a child ?
' poirot ' s smile broadened .
i look at it like this , he said after a minute or two .
thirty-seven the dream the dream was first published in the usa in the saturday evening post , october _num_ , _num_ , then in the strand , february _num_ .
head housemaid she was when she finished , and three maids under her .
she had a heart condition and doctors tried to keep her from doing too much , but she was the sort of woman that you couldnt dictate to .
not quite out of the top drawer .
clement is in london , they know mr .
its sign-posted , i think .
up to now they had been rather bored with bulawayo .
it is foolish to believe in them .
upward had seen it .
he led the way back .
niece , joanna crawford ?
ted gerard came on the scene .
now what is it you want me to tell you ?
whos your present charwoman ?
on the steps outside were footprints leading up to the window , and a second set going away again .
what were you signalling about ?
owen dealing out crazy justice and starting on his own wife for a crime they both committed .
you and mademoiselle meredith have tea together .
in the past i have amused myself with the jewels , the bibelots , the little curiositiesit all helps one to live , you understand .
there was noerwoman of any kind mixed up with captain harwell ?
she would have liked to have consulted henry , but later would do .
not quite all there , some people say .
i had it just as we stepped on to the plateau here , said carol .
aha , you become more interested now .
i didnt mean her ankle .
tommy , muttering vaguely : oherratherthanks , sat down at the other end of the table .
one picture is of polflexan , the cove and lighthouse and the pierthe usual aspect that all amateur artists sit down and sketch .
like everything else in the house , the furniture was falling to pieces , and the dirt was , if anything , more abundant .
japp rushed after him , grabbed him , and threw him on to the settee , taking the suitcase from him as he did so .
a hundred yards away was a bus stop where a bus ought to arrive in a few minutes .
oh , are you ?
marguerita clayton said quite simply : no .
he is a man who prepares for every contingency .
and he had been there , and someone else .
you have known all the time ?
you would like thatto go abroadto see wild parts of the earth ?
the horror of the leper .
as i tell you , monsieur , i saw m .
inglethorp had been poisoned and the poison must have been administered sometime between the hours of seven and nine .
probably you will refuse but you might not refuse because i think you are a man who is ready to take risks .
george barton only shook his head .
she said , perhaps , but it made for stability if a husband was older than his wife .
shes never had a regular boyfriend .
poor papa , he never had a chance .
do you know if dr .
it was all heavenly .
the panel then closed .
really , said alicia , i dont see why she shouldshes got all she wants .
is itbecause of the shock ?
no , all he could say was that the dentist had seemed perfectly normal and calm in his manner .
the compartment in which poirot found himself was occupied by an elderly lady with a very wrinkled face , a stiff white stock , a good many diamonds and an expression of reptilian contempt for the majority of mankind .
pearson , that it may be necessary to detain you until after the inquest .
now then ?
_num_ ' it would have been no good my speaking to chantry , ' he said .
they say we serve teas here , but i never heard of it .
it seems to meyou must excuse my interesti am an old man , somewhat infirm and a great part of my time is given to idle speculation on matters which interest meit seems to me that there must have been some definite occurrence at stansfield grange which , so to speak , brought your fears to a head .
just exactly what do you mean , miss marple ?
i must say that i had no feeling whatsoever that i had a great success on my hands , or anything remotely resembling that .
jeremy murmured vacantly : lynnoh , yes , of course .
well , ill try and tell you some time .
he managed the workmen well , and , what was far more difficult , he managed katharine woolley well .
for it was proved , beyond any possible doubt , that mr .
im off , m .
clair , a lady of unimpeachable breeding and social standing , lived with her as duenna .
lady julia ' s voice spoke in an agitated whisper .
bantry with complete frankness .
she looked worried .
so frightfully plucky .
plenty of food and drink and a lot of models of slavesa richly ornamented gaming board , perfume sets and cosmetics , and i insist on the most expensive canopic jarsthe alabaster ones .
you dont know half of what goes on .
she turned her head slightly towards him .
all the same , he said thoughtfully , mr .
where are you going to look ?
was there anyone else who saw you return at nine twenty ?
no fantastic trafficking with the devil , no black and evil splendour .
whats the good of my making you these things ?
with the remembrance of these delirious ravings in my mind i go up and examine it more closely .
youll have to wait for it .
is helen alive ?
it was not in human nature to resist .
trust a frenchman .
that was japp speaking , hastings .
twenty-three years younger , to be exact .
supposing , hastings , that michael seton made a will before he started on his flight , and that in that will he left all he had to his fiance .
he made me shiver .
miss williams sounded embarrassed .
he married gerda , whom you might describe inelegantly as a first-class chump .
she turned abruptly and made off at right angles to where a belt of larches showed on the hillside .
hobbies .
i wonderi suppose it would be great presumption on my partif only i could assist you in my very humble and , im afraid , very feminine way .
its the one thing yes , mr .
she waits till the torch reaches the spot she must aim forthe wall near which she is supposed to be standing .
carter looked inquiringly at him , and tommy explained .
she was not in the mood to be amused .
epidaurus seemed particularly beautiful to me , but it was there really that i ran up against the archaeological character for the first time .
where are you now ?
fancy seeing you again so soon !
the mans back is to me , but i can watch the girls face .
he had returned to new york cursing his skinflint of an uncle who cared more for the bones of dead and gone kings than his own flesh and blood .
and anyway the secretary knew her .
you left me alone .
she slipped out of her pyjamas and into her bathing dress .
a witchs hat wears out just like anything else does .
ah , very likely .
ive got a very good chance of winning the singles and julia and i might win the doubles , though i dont think its very likely .
but the next development when it came was so serious in its character that it found him totally unprepared .
diamondsnow they could be in a secret drawer quite easily .
yes , indeed , we have all noticed it .
i regret infinitely to derange you , but you will perhaps understand that the atmosphere of the villa is not too congenial to me .
norton gave a quick shake of the head .
my dear fellow , i was there in the house myself .
miss williams said drily : mrs .
things that happened .
dates of certain happenings , where people were , what happened to them , what they were doing .
rather unlikely , said sir charles .
when the police searched the house they found cupboards full of empty brandy bottles in her room , i believe , she added .
and the price of love , and mary of scotland ?
did he seem in a happy and normal state of mind ?
geraldthat was my brotherdidnt get on with grandfather either .
he nearly always entertained us in london on the rare occasions when we happened to meet .
underneath the quarrels , the misunderstandings , the apparent hostility of everyday life , a real and true affection can exist .
clarissa stared at him .
easiest thing in the world to drop your ticket .
it had clearly been freshly cleaned and scrubbed .
and at that moment it happened .
do not enrage yourself , madame , i beg .
what came in was not so much fresh air as much hotter , infinitely dustier air and a troupe of about twenty-six large hornets .
i looked round at the shadowy figures .
the other nodded .
the other passengers were sprawled about near them , eating odd bits of food from the baskets they carried with them .
he even had a say in the designing of it .
theres cedric , not caring a bit about his brother alfreds death or about harolds .
she is not then , said mrs .
he had some rather conspicuous red sails on that boat , but weve found that he had some white sails as well stowed away .
smethurst , however , shook his head .
merrowdene was showing her hand .
inspector jameson preserved a respectful silence .
as it happened he put it down on a decayed bit of fish washed up by the flood tide .
oh , well , ive known him for seven .
inspector narracott nodded thoughtfully .
either of them might have thought of phosphorus and its suitability in this particular case , but the incident of the dogs ball did not seem to fit a masculine mind .
mines no good , and anyway its difficult to light a gas fire with one .
all that i had gone through made for a kind of acid test .
i wont let anyone drive me away !
poirot , i really feel its my duty .
congratulated our man yet ?
douglas gold was staring at the convulsed face of the woman in the chair .
ah well , i could tell you a lot more about that .
youre rather badly in need of money , arent you , mr .
if she was a witness of the actual crime , it would be late at night , round about eleven p .
(but you never will have a chance , said a voice in her brain .
therell be a couple of themeh ?
had the colonel mentioned at all where he was going ?
ive got to have your help .
miss bulstrode left the room and returned bringing the matron with her .
for some reason sybil didnt like the suggestion .
or by someone else ?
coming , poirot ?
wanting to write to a clergyman and all that ?
not in the best taste , im afraid .
because he had read a few books , he set himself up as an authorityagainst a man who has made a lifelong study of the subject .
i can promise you that , said battle .
later , i asked him if he would like to come to a wagnerian concert that was to take place at torquay in four or five days time .
thank you so much , miss willett .
for you , my child , said poirot , turning to mary , i think you might perhaps do good work in andover .
it was goodbye to the good old world .
roughly id say thats quite right .
and leave rutherford hall ?
the immediate remedy seemed to be that we must economise .
of course it could be all sorts of things .
youve seen chief inspector kemp , of course ?
the journey started uneventfully .
he does not care to be a witness upon oath in a murder trial , and the strength of the case against david hunter depends very largely upon the identity of the dead man .
come along to the old bus .
poirot said : cest possible .
thats been apparent all along .
i put it on in case we needed to fill up the pot again .
marthe daubreuil was the only person , besides jack renauld , likely to have the third dagger in her possession .
ones feet are not what one would like feet to be .
then it couldnt have been bad language , i said .
here , patrick indicated the two big bowls of chrysanthemums , are the funeral wreaths and these dishes of cheese straws and olives represent the funeral baked meats .
i made one final test .
i didnt quite understand what they were jawing about , but they hauled me up the stairs somehow or other .
envying a person , resenting them , cadging off themit isnt good for one .
nothing would happennothing could happen .
mary stared at her .
she usually kept them around her .
but dear auntie-grannie , it has been there for ten months .
poirot smiled , but did not answer .
i sprang to her assistance .
his face was blank .
theyre a backward lot here .
but youre a caution , isnt he , captain hastings ?
well , if you call him a gentleman .
exterminated ?
in fact , one more proof that it isnt suicide .
well , that she didnt do , said miss marple , with unexpected decision .
it is decidedly ingenious what you have thought of there .
rowley sounded sympathetic .
oh , i dont no , i meant a young man with spectacles .
i would do it again .
some household reason , perhaps .
besides , they say now in hospitals that it isnt the right thing to put on .
he said margharita can explain or you can .
rose sheldon had been calm and competent up till now .
i held her up as long as i could .
i shall tell her quite firmly that it is not any business of hers or of mine , and that i have no intention of obtaining information from you and retailing it to her .
both of them were doctors , and both were clever men .
parker pyne nodded .
mary condescended to reply to this .
the large wardrobes and chests of drawers stood open while my mother sorted amongst such things as artificial flowers , and an array of odds and ends called my ribbons and my jewellery .
is it about the house anywhere ?
what will they say or do ?
we succeeded in getting away , all right , paying handsomely for our smoke .
the matter was discussed fully .
what are you complaining about ?
egg lytton gore said the only thing she could say .
it would come on to me .
think back over last night .
youre definitely of the opinion now that it was not suicide ?
hercule poirot is in my hands it shall be sent .
you heard all i had to say this morning .
as she spoke , bobby was aware of a glimpse into a strange , evil atmosphere .
oliver looked at cheltenham with approval .
and of course they only found the dead mans own .
poirot hoped to get a little nearer the promised revelation by an encouraging but not too direct question .
why didnt they engineer another accident ?
you might have had some idea , perhaps , of what edna brent wanted to see you about ?
and then the inevitable happens .
i put them in store in casesome dayi should need them .
the doctor drove firsta nice straight shot , but with no great distance about it .
you see this sort of thing on the telly far-fetchedthats what you think cant really happen .
that is exact .
but he couldnt cope with it .
renisenb turned her head .
the grenadier greeted poirot amicably .
oh yes , i forgot .
i do not know where he broke his journey .
and at lastat lastthey turn the key and let me out .
i cant believe hes as fat and yellow as you say he isoh !
the girl at the table got up .
more or less , mrs .
' she came in and stood demurely before him .
there is no reason why he should be caused further distress than he is already suffering at this moment .
but i was waiting for it !
she nags the children rather .
youve no call to say anything of that kind .
then , turning to poirot , he said in an almost childlike voice : you didnt seeanything ?
without more ado , the superintendent recounted the result of his researches in devonshire .
this is the maison blanche .
she greets the poor woman and strangles her .
who was it his brother had been ?
they wrote frequently and affectionately , but they could offer neither a home nor companionship to their mother .
were very sorry to trouble you , miss van schuyler .
there was one person in particular , wasnt there ?
he looked round , beaming on the assembly .
suddenly there was a roll of drumsthe lights went down .
a very kind thought of yours .
reiter was standing in the door of the photographic room .
been very seasick , poor chap , and not appeared before .
please answer me .
' ' no , sir , can ' t say i did .
there was nothing unusual or different in any way in his manner ?
then she said : you have seen three of my brothers .
so all was settled , and rosalind , myself , jessie swannell , and lucy all arrived at addison mansions and started family life .
rudd , do you mean by that you cant or that you wont ?
i said a possibility , madame , that is all .
she saw the universe as more brightly coloured than it was , people as better or worse than they were .
he wont , said dakin .
when poirot spoke , his voice was warm and gentle .
yes , it fits in .
well , i strolled around and came back to the house .
you mean of the twin sister ?
sorry ive had such a grouch .
i still suspected her of seeking information about mrs .
it was so surprising and happened so quickly that it seemed to richard like a cinema scene rather than a scene in real life .
nothing is more wearying than going over things you have written and trying to arrange them in proper sequence or turn them the other way round .
scott and then himself .
miss prescott forbore from saying that she really couldnt care less where miss marple lived .
first gerald wadethen ronny devereux .
i should never dream of being jealous of reggie .
it was a shock to me when about six months after she came to us i discovered sites age .
colour , said mr .
i really do think valentine chantry is very nearly the most idiotic woman i ever met .
i know she writes crime stories .
you are french , is that right ?
you would have to butt in just that minute , mr .
said bobby at last .
something about a fine italian hand .
who had been in the house this timewithin the last day or two ?
she is wondering what to do .
ronald was a very fascinating man .
charles , it would have been so easy for her to substitute a bona fide bottle of insulin afterwards .
i went along just as i had said i would and got thethe stuff from the man .
but now she stirred .
whose were they ?
a cry arose from the old lady .
edward latimer .
' you lack the brains and the imagination of mr simpson , hastings .
the girl mentions that he had a lot of money on himshe saw him take a handful of notes out of his pocket .
was that all there was to it ?
her husband stood there for a moment looking at her .
your late lamented friend would have told you that a man who keeps calm has always a great advantage .
the young man took a deep draught of water , and announced himself better .
i shall tell my father ive met you , she said .
there was a pause , no significant fact striking either of them .
is that true , and if so , what was it ?
terrible it is .
cruel hard twould be for hospitals to get it all .
i knew he would rise in the world .
tcha , tcha , said mr .
but the fact remains - the act was hers - not another .
marks way , he said , and clove him to the brain .
before it took effect , however , she had come to my room and told me all about matters .
ought to be shotthe lot of them !
the housemaid , emma gaunt , was a tall middle-aged woman who had been in service there for many years and who had nursed clode devotedly .
and then they all break out at once just saying the things that first come into their heads .
looks like one of mine .
she had never mentioned having any .
in particular , poirot and race examined carefully a case full of legal and business documents , most of them requiring linnets signature .
well see about the attics tomorrow , darling , said mrs .
i have been longer here than i meantsuch charming company .
yesbutmr jones ?
but this was the tenth case .
you will make a case against me and how am i , a poor woman with no great wits , to defend myself ?
my name is poirothercule poirot .
and you yourself would have been seen in the vicinity at the time !
its much more uncomfortable than the hole , said megan .
he thought for a moment that he knew who she was , then he realized that this only a slip of a girl .
oh , ill use that .
im sorry if ive offended you .
anthony marston was murdered , of course .
havent you got a bicycle ?
not to me , that is .
a week at le pinet .
griselda was silent and so was i .
if we can give him confidence in himself .
hercules , you said , and glory be to god , theres a hercules running in the three-thirty tomorrow .
lady coote made room for jimmy by her side , and he promptly , being a tactful young man , admired her work .
eye for the girls .
i send you to find the socks so that we may know the truth .
you do not seriously ask me that ?
how my aunt manages to cling on to life in the way she does beats me .
the stuffs probably got some quite simple nice easy name like evipan or veronal or eastons syrup or something of that kind .
hip hip hurrahvery good , very nice .
it was then that her elder sister , who had recently married a rich american as his second wife , wrote to her offering to adopt one of the children and bring it up as her own .
it has a personal application , has it not ?
he was dissatisfiedbut he would have been at a loss to explain why .
does nobody know whenwhen she died ?
i say , i think george has broken your bed .
why do you say that ?
i dashed down to philip .
the body in the library ( _num_ ) the very-respectable colonel and mrs bantry have awakened to discover the body of a young woman in their library .
she can slip out quietly .
that is the point of viewyes , agreed carver .
but i suppose i would have in any case .
it was not what i expected .
_num_ from paddington meet you at oakbridge and his correspondent signed herself with a flourish his ever constance culmington .
because he could not see it properly , t ' inspector barnett said sharply , ' didn ' t he have his glasses on ?
what do i know about such things ?
poirot said mildly : but she was a stranger down here .
also , there did not seem to be burglar alarms anywhere in the housethat was dangerous .
miss marple was shaking hands with bryan eastley .
is itall right ?
he leaned back and looked at the ceiling .
what about you ?
she sees or hears someone on the ladder , takes a cautious observation , and to her annoyance sees that inconvenient personthe wife !
make it a bit earlier than that ?
why on earth its mums .
joes good enough for me and im good enough for him .
i was shaking .
the snow came down thick and fast .
folliat , smiling at her .
if he wants to see me , he can come in here .
her creative imagination was so strong that it could never see things as drab or ordinary .
leave it all to nature .
inspector narracott frowned .
but it is that you have the mania for false hair ?
who ever would murder dr .
folliat spoke then .
but i dont really believe it , m .
among grannies things you were never sure what you would find .
our first proceeding was to make a considerable change in our appearance .
something was pullingpulling him downwards .
a man who had lived an out-of-door lifeabroad , perhaps .
he removed his pipe from his mouth and said : well , nurse , back from hassanieh ?
i did not think that michael rafiel was a murderer .
whats linda to do with it ?
please tell me about last night , miss simmons .
surely she had heard before - ?
his eyes , which had formerly been shut , were now open , and something in them , something mocking and indefinable , startled the worthy canon .
my dear , you said something of the sort in your last book , i remember .
thats by way of being an accident , sir , said superintendent crossfield .
she flushed but answered quietly : lady tressilian , you know , was fond of discussion .
he shook his head , and then walked slowly away .
sitting a little way away near the window , pat studied them one by one .
you mean she might have been going to have a child ?
three people who , as it happened , were very close upon the scene at the time .
he himself never took a full swing .
but its not so simple as all thatnot in these days .
i remember when i was very small seeing one of mothers prettier friends being helped to dress for a dance by old hannah , grannies cook .
he has only to wait till uncle anthony shows definite signs of pegging out .
for instance from the drawer beside him tommy took out a formidable dark green eyeshade , covering both eyes .
she looked pleased .
theyre not pleasant things to get , i know .
the conductor returned with a bundle of passports and tickets .
he paused and then said : one thing you do remark , i hope .
its all sofantastic .
im not quite sure what name this chap will give you .
im pretty certain he was really in marlow , but of course i cant prove it .
thank goodness , that colonial fellow had taken himself off .
now for the deductions .
it said that , did it ?
well , you laid the breakfast , didnt you ?
i think youre working yourself up a little , dr .
laidlaws train of admirers was a simple but extremely wealthy gentleman of the name of hank ryder .
they could all , except one , get on with their own lives .
wed be delighted to have you here .
theyve been shoved in a bit tight and youve got to thin em out a bit and put em over there instead , you see , when youve made proper gaps .
you said id have to get a piano tuner .
or , alternatively , in frightening me into abandoning my task ?
ill just have a word with her first and then she can go off to bed .
carlile , m .
four aunt kathies parties were always much the same .
simone has a wonderful gift and she has used it freely , but now she has done her part .
perhaps , then , said poirot nodding his head sagely , miss arundell knew what she was doing when she left her money as she did .
he thought he heard a cry , and for a moment wondered if his ball could have hit anybody coming along the footpath .
fool of a girl mixed up some bottles in the dark , said lord whitfield .
it slightly annoyed miss lemon when he did soshe was very nearly the perfect machine , completely and gloriously uninterested in all human affairs .
the pudding was burnt because he , john christow , had stayed sitting in his consulting room for a quarter of an hour after he need , thinking about henrietta and mrs .
im curious to see the boy after all these years .
but i couldn ' t have seen anything , could i ?
well , you see , madame , someone in a scarlet kimono entered either your or mr .
no , thank you , edward .
he waved his sponge .
anyway , it gave way , and i was chucked into the stream .
there are men walking about today who ought to be in gaol .
ive got a job to do .
i entered the police force .
the doctor is already on his way , he will do all that can be done for the poor suffering one , that is arranged for , but never never will roscari be able to sing tonight .
she explained that she couldnt very well be rude to a man whom she had not seen for some timei think she felt especially a horror of being snobbish !
i was to choose my own time and moment to make myself known to you if i thought that that would be the better way .
he brought two .
warily , giles and gwenda exchanged a warning glance .
and i can assure you , inspector , that it was fifteen years since i had last seen john christow .
no fluidthe brakes dont act .
the sort of chest or bureau thing next to the bed .
on saturday morning , coming down to breakfast at the pleasant guestly hour of ten-fifteen , he almost collided with his hostess , mrs bantry , in the doorway of the breakfast room .
some jolly useful tips to be picked up there .
it was inevitable that sooner or later he would be forced into the open .
i cant , quite frankly , believe in them myself .
fair enough , she said .
what about molly ?
he told me to post it myself .
carter smiled more wearily than ever .
first of all , i ought to tell you that there can be no doubt about it , your uncle was poisoned last night .
i dont prescribe them more than i can help , but theyre not dangerous taken properly .
the pedestal of each was duly inscribed with the land and race that had been proud to possess him .
going to offer me fathers latest wildcat acquisition as well as the old blackbird mine and things of that kind .
do you think , for instance , that mrs clayton was in it , too .
go on , please .
he has now only to haul in the cord and bring up the quern .
poirot leaned out and spoke to the wagon lit conductor who was hurrying past .
this is very disheartening , said tommy .
i dont know if it was heart or what it was .
signor giovanni mezzi , rome .
that is the attitude , i think .
he opened a drawer and took out a small delicate gold-chased lighter .
for a moment jack renauld hesitated , then he made up his mind .
this then was the paper she had bought on the sunday preceding her death .
the door swung slowly open .
vyse , shocked at the idea .
he inquired playfully .
isnt that what we really want as a sex ?
no , ill be delighted to sit with molly .
what had she to feel wicked about ?
carey explained to me that you could feel the difference at once with a pick , and he tried to show mebut i never saw .
there are so many things i would like to know and do not know .
but , if youll excuse me , there are more important things than meals !
and a cupboard under the tiles for rupert .
otherwise you are tied to carrying out other peoples ideas in a way which will not accord with ones own .
horshams here , too he may have something new to tell us , said chetwynd .
there was the sound of someone stirring on the floor below .
we often took to the sea on such beaches as were given over to the mingling of the sexes .
a shock ?
poirot murmured in a conversational tone : you were attached to your uncle , mr .
the hilt of the dagger was plainly visible from the door then .
treves , that women possess little or no pride where love affairs are concerned .
that was what sandra would feel .
im hopeful .
you inject a big enough dose to kill .
if i remember rightly you were always very suspicious of husbands .
and you were heading for it too !
then he riled them by disappearing .
my felicitations , madame .
that is what we ask ourselves .
the whole population seemed to have turned out to watch the arrival of the boat , and the launching of the gangway was attended with excited cries and directions .
at a faint guess he hazarded it might be turkish or persian or armenian , but even of that he was by no means sure .
erskine said nothing .
thats very clever of you , maam , said jane , speaking for the first time .
and suppose it isnt ?
a curio .
during that quarter of an hours interval , our good gentleman mailed this .
did he come down the car towards you at all ?
hugh chandler took a long breath .
i think weve seen you down here before , sir , said the inspector .
not that i ever meant to let on about it .
someone else left him that night white with rage .
but , like the doctor , i concern myself sometimes with so-called accidental deaths .
well , it was good for business after all .
but i have to do that .
the name , written just above his own , recalled a flow of memories .
thats all right , sylvia , old girl .
rather a hard face , perhaps , but competent .
lets see it .
they were passing remarks .
or else !
rhoda looked disappointed .
hullo , isobel .
the circumstances are quite clear .
elsie , indeed .
the last tenant was moving out , as his lease was up .
yes , it was all very much in character .
well , lets hear about it , said mr .
his hands were twitching and he kept passing his tongue over his dry lips .
he would have left money to mea lot of money !
but i must say it seemed odd .
poirot , was evil .
as a young man in the belgian police force i shot down a desperate criminal who sat on a roof and fired at people below .
he didnt go out , for instance , somewhere about eight to eight thirty ?
public need .
im going to another coffee morning the day after tomorrow , said tuppence .
george lomax frowned .
a rag ?
what , then , would be your frame of mindyou , a spoilt idol who has never known a rebuff ?
how many latchkeys were there ?
she ran up the stairs to avoid further questions .
said hercule poirot thoughtfully .
a certain article of great value , which was always carried on prince alis person , was missing .
i will give the answer now .
as he read it he stiffened visibly .
you remember , madame , that i warned you not to do anything dangerous .
would that be better ?
well , that was one of my great relaxations .
my energetic hastings , poirot said and smiled at me .
the victorians looked dispassionately at their offspring and made up their minds about their capacities .
molly never used to seem a nervous type .
you are not on my side .
evelyn looked shocked .
oh , it is always possible .
she was carrying a lot of parcels .
what i mean is , it wouldnt be safe for you .
i could not think of him as other than our amusing , genial , travelling companion .
she will not do that .
gladys nevill shook her head .
leidner always says its very interesting , so i suppose it must be .
she said , with a little catch in her breath : i want to tell you something , jeff .
the bed had not been slept in , but was turned down ready for the night .
hercule poirot gestured towards the picture on the wall .
by the way , a gardener has been clipping ivy round the house .
i love you , he said .
he goaded her past endurance and i , for one , do not blame her for what she did .
first , to colin and michael , the schoolboy grandson and his friend , nice polite lads of fifteen , one dark , one fair .
i have frequently observed buses going thereor do i mean seven sisters ?
they go free of sin , you see .
its about the only thing that saved us from bankruptcy .
come on , josephine , i said .
they were the most persistent .
they think it might be .
but this is marvellous , he cried .
whats what ?
i exclaimed , surprised .
she had certainly thought that she had seen a man going into that particular compartment , but she realized that she might easily have been mistaken .
but i should not like to swear definitely that i saw it there .
sir joseph turned purple .
insolence , plain speaking , a dash of wit now and again (not too much lest i should have to live up to it) , and behind it all , a very shrewd observation of human nature .
lying there so peacefullywith the little hole in her head .
surreptitiously , she read furiously when she was alone in the house .
the initial h is connected with three peoplemrs .
you have the look of a mule when it puts its ears back and kicks .
i cant remember much about the work side of thingsi dont think it can have been very interesting .
he gave them money and freedom .
cust was that dreadful monster , a b c .
frightened of what ?
several times , i believe .
she said , really bad ?
his deteriorating health and her devotion .
he thought .
do not set your heart on that girl .
is he installing a dictaphone or something like that ?
blundell , he said .
such a lovely bit of workmanship .
because of her worry , many things were kept which ought to have been destroyed .
the nearest station is oakbridge , you will be met there and motored to sticklehaven where a motor launch will convey you to soldier island .
why do youwhat do you know of the big four , mademoiselle ?
i tried to pacify her .
i am afraid that was my fault .
so i says , well nip around and make sure , and when we finds its number seventy-four we talk it over , and maybe , bill says , the address in the notebooks got nothing to do with it , and i says as maybe it has , and , anyway , after weve talked it over and heard the police want to interview a man who left the ouse about that time , well , we come along ere and ask if we can see the gentleman whos handling the case , and im sure i ope as we arent wasting your time .
im going to kill him .
mcginty used to say .
there were a few odds and ends , a letter or two , but the letters were trivial and dated some time ago .
but it explains in a way , about gipsys acre .
they always do .
after the dusk of the passage , the evening sunshine that was pouring into the room made my eyes blink .
no suspicion was ever aroused .
at a little after four oclock , went on the inspector , mr .
the money that was your unclesthat he left to his wifenaturally he always assumed it would come to you .
katherine smiled at the horror in the others tone .
norma isnt normal !
and nobody saw her do it ?
how did you get hold of this correspondence ?
this gate was not of the same ornate ironwork but had two handsome gate pillars surmounted by two vast pink pineapples .
but theres another possibility .
the apartment has been searched twice .
and then i lost , and then i thought i must go on .
in spite of myself i felt annoyed .
like me to show you ?
is that japp ?
she raised her hands hopelessly .
this led to a neat little bridge over the stream and on the other side of the stream where once there had been meadows with cows , there was the development .
dane calthrop , but it wouldnt be a very good answer , because so many men have obviously married the wrong woman .
various cars noticed in the vicinity of bexhill and cooden were either accounted for or could not be traced .
he went up in smoke .
of course , i said hurriedly .
no , i dont mean hensley , said mr .
you hardly ever say an unkind thing about anyone .
so its you at last ?
ellsworthys correspondence was unilluminating , but some of his booksthose tucked away at the back of a cupboardrepaid attention .
nothing really surprised you when youd been in the law a number of years .
warming to my subject , i ran over the heads of the affair , working up to the triumphant and unexpected dnouement .
whatever the trouble was , its over and finished with .
a doctor , too , has opportunities , went on mr .
perhaps he walks out with a company commander in the ats .
the third was a born giggler who would , he was sure , agree with whatever anyone else said .
mercado pointing .
she enjoyed typing , paying bills , filing papers and entering up engagements .
at a twist through the trees they came out on a space surmounted by a small white plastered temple .
she had tried tightly arranged curls , she had tried a kind of artistic disarray .
once he said , candles , and another time he said something that sounded like douzaine .
what is there for you here ?
and he had gone to henrietta straight away , sending a curt telephone message home about being called away .
the doctor opened it .
shall i tell you my ideas on the subject , sir arthur ?
i was up here last wednesday , i remember , walking up and down this same terrace .
peter lord stared at him , looked away , stared again and finally burst out laughing .
but its exactly for that reason im so anxious to go .
no reproaches .
i will tell you , mr .
the truth is something different .
from london .
how dare you ?
sometimes i really think she is !
he was taken into the cave which gave the place its name , and haydock pointed out enthusiastically how it could have been used .
george was not an abernethie , but he was the only male of the younger generation .
next thing i know , youd be heading for burma or darkest africa .
i should have said it was the happiest state imaginable .
and my feet a stamping sound was heard .
might have fallen from the keyhole , might have been dropped there by one of the people who entered , might have been slipped underneath the door from the outside .
the curse is come upon me !
no one can prove that i even knew the woman .
tuppence felt a little nervous .
there is also the evidence of scentan expensive and exotic scent which mrs .
but , mon ami , we know something that lady juliet does not .
is it my fault that people come here and lie to me and have forged papers and are wanted to assist the police in murder cases ?
some old friend of general ravenscroft , i think , which hed known in malaya .
i gazed at him , impressed , but utterly uncomprehending .
sunday express : a puzzle that is tortuous , surprising , andsatisfying .
was it she who had just said that or was it somebody else said it to her ?
and wed never suspect poisonnot with madness in the family already .
ever heard of the word graft , sir ?
i was pleased to think that you would be coming here .
nevertheless , whether miss lawson was or was not as ignorant as she declared herself to be , only one person really knew the true facts .
can i come in , mrs .
but how did boracic get into that bottle ?
a girl called celia austin .
not alwayssometimes the capting would say as i neednt .
it was just beginning to come out the other day .
my job is to look after miss greggs social life , her public and private engagements , and to supervise in some degree the running of the house .
she gave a slight gracious nod of the head and rose .
its a funny thing , you know , he went on , in a reminiscent , almost gossipy manner , looking like an old farmer discussing his stock and his land , ive learnt after a great many years trial and errorive learned to distrust a pattern when its simple .
but it is not a painful photograph in any way .
he was to place himself at the disposal of this lovely creaturefor she was lovely , of that there was no doubt .
to think of that .
i won ' t be swindled .
vandemeyer gazed round her fearfully .
i winced .
so fantastic .
but here was a man whom , as dermot immediately admitted to himself , it would not be easy to read .
it was a bit difficult to take in all at once , anthony cosden went on .
me , i speak always the truth .
i complied .
i think he likes me a littlenot as much as you , but a little .
george paused and went on .
something , some undercurrent of mockery in her tone , made the man look at her sharply .
a doctors life , i always think , is so noble and self-sacrificing , said miss marple .
that was rather absurd of me , wasnt it ?
she just likes making a fuss .
angela warrens severe face lighted up appreciatively .
my name is hastings .
that chinese devil meant business , i was sure of that .
i mean , sometimes you come across a dummy , so to speaksomeone who just comes to a place and poses as a miss spinkswhen all the time there isnt a miss spinks .
' 	he nodded slowly .
chester looked flushed and angry .
an odour of bitter almonds was still perceptible .
derek kettering laughed .
shot himself , didnt he ?
yes , of course i understand , but david just do as i say , rosaleen .
you know that musical show , damn your eyes ?
i waved to him and then turned away .
this placed beyond question the fact that the destroyed will had been in favour of the deceased ladys husband .
she shifted her head from side to side .
its baffled me a great deal .
thrilling , you know !
i was at vine street the other day to see about a diamond brooch i had lost , and there was the most perfectly lovely inspectorthe nicest man i ever met .
she is your sisters illegitimate child ?
im tired , george .
the picture , too .
this mans an impostorhes playing the part of quentin for purposes of his own .
then joanna said : do change your mind and stay to lunch with us , dr .
he might have been seventy or eighty , or even ninety .
miss arundell snapped : dont be idiotic , minnie .
it would be years before grapes would bear fruit again .
haydock this morningnow i wonder if i remember rightly .
go on , he urged her .
on a table in the morning-room there was a heap of papersall the papers that the late mathew stroud had left .
your car here , harker ?
elinor said : theres nothing the matter with me .
this is what its all about , he told her .
she had chosen to tell her story to me , believing that i should be a more sympathetic and lenient audience than the police .
ah , heres micky !
that well-known tag from the past came into her mind .
i wondered whether you would remember that .
i was celebrating at the mustard and cress , i remember .
there is bread .
cleaning out the augean stables , eh ?
ii must catch that train .
he went back to the drawing room , and miss knight , clucking a little in an indignant manner , followed him .
look at him .
however , i dont really know much about it .
everyone was getting on the jumpy side .
justice wargrave might have a good brain but he was an elderly man .
why , lord whitfields father kept a boot-shop only a few doors from here .
does it not interest you to know ?
ive never been sure) .
that does not surprise you ?
in the pleasure of seeing him and miss johnson together the day before , and his affection and reliance on her , id forgotten all about the letters .
well , the man two seats ahead of me got up and went to the toilet compartment .
the personality of a criminal , georges , is an interesting matter .
what time of day ?
it referred to the mysterious man found dead in new york .
and they were in the safe downstairs ?
as he came to the last bend , he saw the anglo-indian colonel being shown out .
deirdre henderson looked at poirot doubtfully .
that shadow of embarrassment came over us again .
she offered her guest a cigarette , but poirot refused politely , explaining that he preferred his own .
did she talk to you at all about what cora had said ?
henet went on , her voice growing more and more hysterical .
she found it interesting .
but somebody had .
she wasnt strong then ?
its the exchange , said mr .
what sounded like the report of a firearm made them all start , but carrie louise said : its all right , its outsidein the park somewhere .
he said sharply : why do you want to know that ?
lots of things , said frankie promptly .
they were pretty little flowers and they grew wild on the sides of the tell .
did you actually say just now that you wanted me to be indiscreet ?
her voice was slightly wistful .
it is very hard to speak of these things to strangers .
i am the mystery man of scotland yard .
olivers stories , said spence , you ought to have found the dog howling over the two dead bodies .
he says he thought matilda was dead years ago .
does yahmose thinkwhat did he tell you ?
how careless of me .
miss sainsbury seale said : you know , dear , it really has stopped aching !
not that badgworthy will ever find anything .
why was it left to fall down ?
i belong to her , utterly , for always .
treves said gravely : personally , i am of the opinion that it was a particularly ingenious murdera murder committed by a child and planned down to every detail beforehand .
will you wait a few minutes please , sir .
theres something very wrong with him , said mr .
four oclock ?
not exactly , darling .
more lies , i suppose ?
though perfectly worldly-wise , and able , as she expressed it , to take care of herself , there was yet something curiously ingenuous in her single-minded attitude towards life , and her wholehearted determination to make good .
lords and barons in the surrounding countryside made themselves right with heaven by leaving certain of their lands to the priory .
also he thinks my appreciation of such things frivolous .
dont you think it very odd that sir oswald didnt say what he was doing wandering about in the garden in the middle of the night ?
her husband , for one , and your wife for another .
one goes through that adolescent phase .
its not a nice thought , m .
small round capsules of gelatine .
it was eleven oclock , you comprehend .
oh , go away !
still , thank you for being so conscientious .
letter in english from l .
so m .
and no oneno one at all came near the table while they were away .
i heard you were lunching with the farradays and spied on you from the hillside when you left .
i went back to my room and reflected upon colonel dwyers words .
it would be quite possible , you know .
what can be done , richard ?
they were drunk with the lust of power .
theyre what you might call adrift in the worldhad danger and death and excitement too early in life .
unless it is someone from outside who has found a hiding placeand that , we agreed , was impossible .
the name of a firm that might help us .
and where is he supposed to be now ?
you can rely on me , madam , he said .
bex .
they didnt hear her .
madame journeyed to england fairly frequently .
_num_ seemed in no way different from the neighbouring houses .
i shall tell george myselfi want to be quite straight about the whole thingbut not until after my birthday .
you shouldnt shoot people , said lord caterham in a tone of mild remonstrance .
he cannot understand my condition .
something hovered on miss sainsbury seales lips .
poirot continued dreamily .
we fancied ourselves as sleuths .
so that person , too , was in danger .
he seemed somewhat apathetic in the search , as though he expected no great results from it .
at lastafter all these years .
and of course its just possible that this artist member of the family might be able to identify her .
ohsally finch !
then , turning away , he added limply , well , youd better ask her .
it is very hard to bear when you have lost a person who is one of the three you love best in the world .
it was vital to them that he should never get back with his proofs .
a hearty voice struck suddenly upon his ear .
throwing yourself off a building isnt too nice , either .
then there ought to be .
then it was arlena , hiding till the coast should clear .
a mental tonic .
i think shes an extremely nice and kindly person whom ive treated very badly and who has been most generous and forgiving .
the childs easy acquiescence .
bobby flushed .
there will be room in my aeroplane , said mr clancy firmly .
suspicious circumstances .
the morning wore away .
christow killed her husband , i am quite sure you are wrong .
satipy stared at her with a sudden hostility .
why , you dont think had madame any valuable jewellery ?
v-signs for this one !
i came in to the house and found grannie in the kitchen with a telegram in her hand .
i now suspect that mother herself had never really cared for torquay as a place to live .
good morning , miss grey .
i can see the wallpaper nowmauve irises climbing up the walls in an endless pattern .
therell be dirty work at the crossroads over those letters yet .
but knowing king victor as i do , i am certain that he will not abandon the game without having one more try for the jewel .
i mean , youve got to get the money , havent you , before you can take it abroad .
she stammered out something , but mrs .
from various parts of the house , four people hurried towards the study .
no , thats julius , explained tuppence .
the gardeners evidence as to the witnessing of the will was taken , and then dorcas was called .
inspector kelsey smiled .
she has fallen .
she reacted quickly .
you cant be a sergeant , she said disapprovingly .
oh , how i hate men who splutter !
it was a happy fantasy shared between us , the house that santonix would build for meif he lasted long enough .
race was welcome to them .
i felt it when i got there .
presently she returned with a piece of paper in her hand .
havering was with her in the hall , nevertheless she must have some connection with the murder , or why should she suddenly take to her heels and bolt ?
it is essentialessential , you understand , that your husband should not know where you are .
mais continuez .
because it was now even more imperative that i should see megan straightaway .
a very satisfactory case .
no , kirsty , no .
oh no , said elvira , i shall be terribly careful in future .
she was so good as to confide in me some of the troubles of her early married life .
ive never been in a revolution , said jennifer thoughtfully .
he had come here this evening , why , she wondered ?
that staircase leads only to mr .
im sure she wouldnt .
oh , of courseof course .
i dont want her chattering down here .
if you hadnt anything worth saying why go chattering all the time ?
it is deeper than that .
she had lost count of time , but she knew that she was strangely reluctant to go home to the white house .
if a woman is concerned , as you seem to think (to my mind without any evidence but mere assumption) , i can assure you that miss debenham could not possibly be indicated .
i mean they simply couldnt be in bloom all at the same time dont let a passion for horticultural accuracy run away with you , dolly , said her husband .
ar , she said .
the others made one heart , we made two no trumps and we finally won the rubber with a four-club call .
now what about your car ?
he isnt dangerous to the community .
take away the props and the building will come down .
if , by any chance , there should be a fussif , that is , the properties of nitroglycerine should manifest themselves too evidently , he would be able to say in an injured voice , i told mother .
i came to in this beastly hole , he said .
i wonder if someones managed to inject some stuff into him .
leonard asked what sort of thing , and griselda said elusively : oh , poking her nose into things .
if omurphy is an honest man , why did he leave the main road ?
she interrupted him passionately .
on the way back , she met kelvin .
at that , he noticed , mrs .
anthony marston proceeded on his triumphal progress .
yes , then .
poirot , that i know nothing at all !
obliging as always , the driver helped us to get in , and piled our baggage over and upon us .
the deep tan of his face was somewhat unusual looking amongst these pallid londoners and it had attracted the fellows attention .
this cool detached practical interest defeated him utterly .
have you here now , or have you had here at any time , a young girl called jane finn ?
she said , as i was trying to get the number : what are you going to do , jerry ?
he had travelled through the unknown parts of kurdistan and asia minor .
jamess hospital speaking .
they absolutely wouldnt believe it last night when i told them that that murder with the hatchet in the paper was actually my aunt !
but ive been worried , all the same .
but you wont find anything there .
ahead of him farther down the road poirot descried a house , the top storey of which displayed an unusual note of bulbous construction .
miss gilchrist went on , a kind of desperation in her voice .
he closed his eyes , detached himself from conscious thought or effort , and let a series of pictures flit at will across his mind .
she looked anxious and excited .
eh bien , then , sit downwhat is your name ?
i smiled to myself .
why do you think she wants to leave here ?
be generous .
it came at a moment he stopped .
thats my advice .
thats what you wanted to ask me , wasnt it ?
but i think , you know , we should be happy together .
she picked it upand her heart missed a beat .
do you understand now ?
over the phone .
canon and miss prescott were sitting in beach chairs observing the scene .
all those elderly peoplereally very much like those she remembered when she had stayed here fifty years ago .
tuppence made a desperate guess .
it has nothing to do with us .
it might have been , might it not ?
the evil business still goes on .
but miss johnson was a real lady , and so self-controlled and sensible .
ah , welli will do the best i canthat i promise you .
haydocks .
all the same , said tuppence , blinking back a tear , im disappointed in our mr .
' her manner changed .
god has blessed me with supreme power .
description was circulated , as you know .
he looked thoughtfully at her , a touch of reserve in his manner .
do you know him , julian ?
of course , he had to , poor old chap , with no money of his own .
will you send the announcement to the morning post .
not seen you for simply centuries , continued the young man .
one of my patients the other day , for instanceive seen that patient before .
she was probably annoyed on alfreds behalf .
do you mean that her real object was ?
she was a tall , long-legged girl , not beautiful but with a charm that was made-up of vitality and a warm-hearted personality .
shaitanas shirtand it was not an extra stud .
when my husband was invalided out of the army after the war with shell shock , a little financial assistance would have been a wonderful reliefwould have enabled me to give him an expensive course of treatment which was otherwise denied to him .
she seemed to hover , waiting , like a watchful dragon .
the beauty of it was that it was quite safe for them .
ackroyd threw him a glance of reproach and took out her handkerchief .
i should never live it down .
well , i dont pretend to be a magician but i do what i can .
well , that was that .
then she must have sherry in it .
iv hercule poirot breakfasted in his room as usual off coffee and rolls .
renauld with an impetuosity that took no heed of the presence of others .
first girl takes the best room , second girl pays rather less , third girl less still and is stuck in a cat-hole .
oh , dear , said bunch .
hale went on : i instituted a search of the house .
he caught sight of charless retreating figure .
she forced herself to address the head of the family , lennox .
he might , agreed the commissary , but that would be a very bold course .
the fourth was lady chevenix-gore .
she was tall and dark , and handsome in a sullen fashion of her own .
there , take it easy now , take it easy .
at least , thats what inspector curry gave us to understand .
poirot unfolded the sheet of paper eagerly , and uttered an exclamation of satisfaction .
ten thousand of the bestpounds , not dollars .
the assured tone had its effect .
i looked in at the district nurses cottage andand mary gerrard was writing out her will .
miss bowers , sir , the hospital nurse lady .
hed been here for years and years .
everybody seems to have assumed that pip was a boyjulia knew , of course , that her twin was another girli dont know why she didnt say so this afternoon family solidarity , said julia .
my sight isnt good enough for shooting , but i could have used a pitchfork , sir , and i intended to do so if necessary .
he achieved this course by a simple statement : someones offered me a thousand a year .
no boyfriends ?
i should , perhaps , madame , tell you a little more about myself .
speaking for my own branch , theres been a good lot of the stuff coming into this country in the last year and a half .
just over a year , sir .
yes , i replied .
she was a sunny , happy sort of creature .
in a weeks time youll be back in america , he said .
this programme we duly carried out , except that we were somewhat late in starting , so that we stopped on the way and picnicked , going on to las nieves afterwards for a bathe before tea .
why should you think it likely that he should confide in me ?
to see ifi meanjust to seebut he wasquite coldandand i got blood on my hand .
i felt unsure of myself .
i am a wreck .
somebody else assumes the chief rle .
chapter _num_ i am afraid this sudden revelation had an almost stunning effect on the three people sitting round the luncheon table .
the eyes , deepset and thoughtful , perceived but would not easily reveal .
there must be something better than that .
bertrams hotel could certainly produce marvels .
would she have sacrificed jacko without a qualm ?
the two boys arrived on the following morning .
a taxi .
he could see no further questions to ask .
norma has been a great worry to her father in that way .
well , its not really a very pleasant story , m .
really what was the last moment we had the opportunity of observing her ?
youare very anxious on this point ?
we know that well enough .
weston said : yes .
she was infirm .
he might wish to spare his wife the pain of watching his own long-drawn-out suffering .
the door was partly masked by a big painted leather screen .
go out from my house .
unless , of course , mr .
with the compliments of the daily wire , he said .
now i understand that all the family were up in your grandfathers room this afternoon , and that someerangry words passed .
but if that draft treaty turns upwere done .
lady coote had a very good answer to thisnamely that as sir oswald was dummy , he had no right to comment on the play of the hand .
after a little more desultory conversation , miss cooke and miss barrow took their departure .
youve got the knowledge , though , havent you ?
what time did you arrive then ?
how has she been lately ?
shed been taking heart medicine for some time .
nerves all to pieceshands shaking .
with some difficulty he disinterred the local telephone directory from under a treatise on pigkeeping and looked up the wetherbys number .
she remained close to him , her shoulder almost brushing his .
iveive changed my mind .
about harry lee i hesitated .
the girl would like to come to england and she can do a lot of sewing and dressmaking for us but are you sure about this , clara ?
ive never been this trip up the nile before .
the next day , however , frankie admitted the daylight and expressed a desire for company and her hostess came and sat with her for some time .
you are a man of considerable knowledge , said mr .
why cant they get on with things ?
you are sincerely repentant ?
that might be natural enough .
what ages ago that seems already .
the fallaciesthe really amazing fallacies that there are in those storiesbut what was i saying ?
leidner of being the murderer , but my experiments with sounds in mrs .
where did she keep her money ?
you ask an impossibility .
what you said has emboldened me to come to you now .
the other two sisters were already sitting there .
you know , he said , i enjoyed the war .
and you were planning to get marriedwhen ?
there had been something in kaits voicesomething faintly menacing , that impressed renisenb disagreeably .
pilar said fiercely : and that is why i cannot do itnot when you speak like thatnot when you are like that !
well !
we know the truth now and i stoppedfor miss marple was nodding her head with such a peculiar vehemence that it made me lose the thread of what i was saying .
oh , sorry , edward .
it has not been a pleasant experience , she said dryly .
its very nice to see , isnt it ?
there was a picture made with shells and a watercolour of a very green sea at capri .
he shook hands and departed .
just the stars and the camelsand how wed forget everything in the world ?
colonel carbury said abruptly : he swears that his mother was alive .
a death in the hotel _num_ .
it could , said poirot thoughtfully .
franklin came out of the laboratory .
i was quite a good accompanist , and could read by sight , so i often had to play accompaniments for other singers .
magdalene sorted through them , trying to arrange them in some kind of order .
whilst waiting for stamps , you dropped it inconspicuously on the floor , so that somebody should come along unsuspectingly and pick it up and post it .
broadribb handed to her , slit up the envelope , took out the enclosure , one sheet of typewriting , and read it .
row me to where that young ass is waiting .
you remember michel said that the door into the corridor of mrs .
six they had all come .
i think we want a little light in here , she said brightly .
my regret had been for the past as the past , not for the reality .
who in england did not know harridges hotel ?
i will tell you what is the matter .
victoria turned and walked across the room to the bed .
are you thinking that she knowsa little more than she has said ?
he moved like a panther , smoothly and noiselessly .
miss marple subsided gratefully on to the rather angular little blue-painted armchair which the bluebird affected .
well , i didnt .
that is true , yes ; that is true what you say .
they hadnt got any evian or vichy , which seems queer to me .
wake up , old thing .
poirot lifted first one , then the other foot from the ground with a cat-like motion .
it was plausible .
my eyes met those of santonix .
but she had steadfastly refused to have anything more to do with her husbands murderer , and it was in revenge for this attitude on her part that he had written this letter accusing her .
if you were to run down the street i should certainly not be able to follow you .
did you say the owner of the housea miss arundell , i think you said ?
she looked towards miss marple .
the same old drama , said mr .
she takes trouble , said midge slowly .
hammond .
she is very pleasing to look at .
i dont know what he felt about mother , really .
giuseppe screwed up his eyes in an effort of memory .
all those childrens books .
he touched the table .
we live at wimbledon .
really greg is so completely wet !
even then , theyd probably think it was the servants .
youre awfully good about those sort of things , tuppence .
and another lot again of the big bully type .
in fact , said miss milray , i dont know what to do .
and miss elinor , a nice-minded young lady as she is , of course she wouldnt realize what was going on .
hercule poirot stopped and picked up a small object-a black stuffed cat .
it seems like that now when i look back and see those two boys .
she seemed to understand .
ill bet you it isnt , said tommy .
antonia fraser , sunday telegraph : a lively and light-hearted read which will give pleasure to all those who have long wished that there was just one more christie to devour .
it was just the way shed said it before , and she had just the same look on her face , and i was frightened again , and i remembered .
no , i mean a small dog , a toy dog .
you forget , i was outside the door when the first one went off .
ferrars by her late husband .
his smile was not a very nice one .
hercule poirot lay awake staring at the ceiling .
pennington began : those british lawyers and stopped .
poirot studied her seriously .
asked lady astwell sharply .
was he nice ?
all i want is my boy .
almost as bad as the boys .
you know our inquiry ?
he had sometimes wondered if conway jefferson thought so too .
she , too , agreed that it was the only thing to do .
the room was empty save for his hostess , and her reproachful gaze gave jimmy the same feeling of discomfort he always experienced on catching the eye of a defunct codfish exposed on a fishermans slab .
badcock said that heather was extremely excited and anxious to meet marina gregg , that she was a great fan of marina greggs and that shed told him that once when she was ill as a girl she managed to get up and meet miss gregg and get her autograph .
he seemed quite bewildered and dazed .
shes absolutely determined .
you can take my word for it .
definitely no carryings on ?
you were in the everyday world once more , and ladies , their skirts looped up and held in one hand , were playing croquet , or , with straw boater-hats on their heads , were playing tennis .
was thatwhatshe was killed with ?
i suppose youre on to all the obvious lines ?
the twenty-five pounds that mrs .
if a bell is sound .
a bit drastic , perhaps .
he indicated the three horsy men .
if youll only marry me , i wont worry you anyyou shall take your own time .
what nonsense i am talking and thinking .
or it could have been partridge .
isnt it splendid ?
they said at the inquest he was a detective .
good lord , pat , what else have you been doing ?
dont do it again , said tommy .
he actually pointed her out ?
lights out .
he gets out a little bottle of stuff that smells very strong .
i just want to say this : its humanly possible that there may be some feature of your acquaintanceship with shaitana that you dont want to come out .
i mean , really , the people who matter are the people who thought of simple things like perforations on postage stamps , or like somebody adam , or whatever his name wasnomacadam in america who put black stuff on roads so that farmers could get all their crops from farms to the coast and make a better profit .
the one who was giving evidence this morning .
we found it , said father , in an area in pond street , whichas you no doubt knowis a street near park lane .
take these three copies of the daily leader .
grainger was sending in a night nurse on the friday , but miss arundell died before the night nurse arrived .
i can appreciate the real thing when i see it , and no one could be nicer than lily has been to me .
thats a very biblical word , inspector .
just taking mrs .
at that moment the cocktails arrived .
you want work ?
lanscombe looked disapprovingly at hercule poirots back as the latter climbed the stairs .
the villain , said mrs .
but all this subconscious stuff !
i deny that categorically .
how many puddings did you make ?
nerve specialist .
for the only reason that presented itself was the fact that one of the rooms in the house (a comfortable well-appointed house) , stirred his curiosity .
he offered me a large fee to undertake the search for the truth and to undertake everything possible with no expense spared .
its rather spidery , im afraid .
for what ?
oh , you dont really think id do anything stupid like that , do you ?
you were aware of thisattachment , madame ?
they went slowly out of the room .
it was on my dressing table when i came back from the bath .
it opened up an entirely new aspect of the case .
all right , said anthony unwillingly .
saying a things murder before you know its murder is libel and you might be had up in court for it .
you did give your life , my dear , said miss bulstrode softly .
she murmured vaguely : oh yes , i see .
well , i shouldnt have thought that that we had much to talk about ?
gentlemen , he said sadly , this business has got me right down !
a bit frenchified , perhaps , but after all where can you get a decent steak and chips nowadays ?
i know just how he feels , cried magda .
it was , therefore , to no .
but , oh , boy !
you admit that , i suppose .
still , she might have had one by her .
van aldins attitude that i went down privately and had an interview with the lady .
it was wonderfully refreshing .
and i think , monsieur , that she is very fond of you .
the wind , he is my lover , the sun my lover too , and bluebell , wild bluebell , shall neer be queen to you .
franklins extremely unconvincing remarks on the subject of putting an end to herself .
talk to him .
then after a space : where is bottle of aspirin ?
i am insured against fire and burglary with the jove insurance company which has a branch here .
all the same , im afraid youll have to cut it outfor your own sake .
no , i was born in india .
peter lord cried out : thats fantastic .
humfries disappeared into his inner sanctum , saying as he did so : miss gorringejust a moment , please .
in that one simple fact lies the answer to the question that has puzzled me so all along .
at twenty-two stephen came down from oxford with a good degree , a reputation as a good and witty speaker , and a knack of writing articles .
marmalade , honey and strawberry jam .
greece and all that .
shes brought the little boys .
secrets ?
it lacks subtlety , perhaps , but it makes for safety .
a fighter pilot .
what an extraordinary girl you are !
in her heart of hearts tuppence believed her .
especially , he had to admit , people who had counted in the social world .
its caroline .
the essence of a detective story , i said , is to have a rare poisonif possible something from south america , that nobody has ever heard ofsomething that one obscure tribe of savages use to poison their arrows with .
i cant see that he could have had anything to do with it .
he still seemed to be thinking .
how did the thing happen ?
they would have been those of m .
give me a line on those two young womenmrs .
i must pretend to leave for durban this evening , take my luggage down and so on , but really i shall go to some small hotel in the town .
maddy and zlie ?
all i do say is that marina gregg definitely thought and believed that that dose was meant for her .
edith pagett paused and coughed primly .
he looked around at jeremy and hugo , and added , accidental death , they brought in .
his voice held an easier note .
eccles , but i dont think there was a knock and the door opened and a clerk entered and produced a sheet of paper which he placed before mr .
two children were playing on the doorstep .
he smoothed it out on the table ; freda was looking over his shoulder .
you tell us something .
what exactly lay behind those last brief words ?
victoria stared in surprise .
i dont mind m .
for the mr desmond lee-wortleys of this world are clever , madame .
vandemeyer said now , and flung something over my nose and mouth as i tried to scream .
yes , but i like to see things in my mind .
i remember getting pricked terribly , but getting more blackberries than anyone else .
be content with that .
he played his part .
if theres a dangerous lunatic about driving inoffensive women to suicide and hitting miserable little maidservants on the head , then im not averse to doing a bit of dirty work to put that lunatic under restraint .
but then , when she was so ill , she asked for the will .
thats yourwhats the phrase ?
poirotcaptain hastings , i mean , isnt it terrible ?
youll know how to do it , none better .
hes shaking the operating table .
i cant think of anything but marina .
a phony platinum blonde , with no face powder and no lipstick !
can you think of anythingany incidenthowever smallthat might help us ?
only my father and mary .
but you have the quick witsthe intelligenceyou can make plausible signs in pencil in the book , can you not ?
and are you sure that this is a good thing ?
so !
oliver was sitting .
we havent all got your nice nature , pat .
did you go to see the old boy or did you go to see the little girl , eh ?
i didnt feel my best .
stephanie gathered up the dress and went out .
nursie repeated them endlessly without the least sign of weariness .
i often wondered why she followed annette round as she did .
anyway , ive made up my mind .
i ought to have known from the very beginning what all this was about .
ive never had the pleasure of meeting her , i dont think .
and then he said about her having been happy with her husband and how perhaps hed made a mistake over that in the past .
eight , therefore , ought to be ample .
i wasnt any too sure about it myself , but i saw the force of my sisters arguments .
gwenda looked indignant .
he was fascinated by the problem of personality .
then suddenly , i saw her eyes widen in surprise .
like an automaton who has had the right button pressed , poppy said : weve some lovely roses , fresh in today .
this isnt just another of your complicated games , intended to make fools of us all ?
affable oysters !
youll know then whether youreally love mary or whether it was only a temporary infatuation .
among those present were sir george and lady du fisse , mr .
oh , well , said frankie , turning it over in her mind .
that must be where there is said to be a secret passage running under the sea to that island .
she had so little general conversation that it was a puzzle to know how to sustain a conversation with her .
dorcas was rather startled by the unexpected question .
tuppence said , her voice low and shaken : ii agree with mrs .
then she turned back again , dry-eyed , dignified and composed .
is he the unshaven dirty kind ?
although we were both making fair incomesmine perhaps a little doubtful and uneven , archies well assuredwe were lamentably short of capital .
he wants to advertise himselfto focus attention on himself .
nurse , im tired .
have you followed up the other young chaps movements on friday ?
you take the holiday ; that is it , yes ?
he won ' t listen to anything against her .
we must have a report fromah , horsham , there you arei did not notice you before .
lorrimers damned good .
have you not , perhaps , some patients to attend ?
i wasnt really joking , you know .
good morning , miss marple .
the cells ?
the students kept most of their belongings and personal papers in their bedrooms .
lived alone in one of those derelict old houses that are being cleared away in order to build a block of modern flats .
but there was a difference .
' charles ?
cast out fear , said lavington .
ever thine , hercule poirot i read and reread this astonishing communication .
nurse craven .
i thought then of coming along to see you , but i decided against it .
though looking pale and somewhat distressed , his manner was perfectly formal and composed .
lance frowned in a puzzled fashion .
its quite cold .
he wont have the sense to realize that i wouldnt let him down unless it were quite unavoidableand , anyway , what does it matter ?
it was a bare room , the walls an uncertain shade of lilac .
most of them are pretty awful , too .
miss pinkerton ?
where are you , chre madame ?
so an inconspicuous part of henrietta listened and replied , and , very far and remote , the real henrietta commented , common mean spiteful little piecebut what eyeslovely lovely lovely eyes .
i knew something more , my friend .
then there came a rather difficult silence .
yes , sir , said sergeant hay , not a muscle of his face moving .
and superintendent battle you doubtless know , said mr .
you never know what that womans up to .
hyoscine !
leidners door , then drew it out and handed it to me .
' i may say that i am very thankful that lorel mayfield actually saw the thief leaving the window .
never mind , i forgive you .
so dont wait for me .
yes , let us examine the case from the standpoint of murder .
i come today with a special object .
ackroyd alive ?
on her knees , a little way behind her , a second girl was holding the first girls skirt well pulled back so that it clung around her knees and legs .
there was another knock at the door , which now opened slowly .
mason was clearly upset at the idea .
very thoughtful indeed .
if hed wanted to kill her he could have used something quite untraceable and nobody would ever have known .
i think , you know , nurse , men sometimes encourage women in these hysterical fancies .
one cant in the world today be sure of anyone .
i do think it was clever of me to see what a good thing it would be to tear off that one page and leave he instead of she .
he had only been a fortnight in mr .
obviously , only the chambermaid .
in the meantime my enemies , convinced that i was obeying their warning , would cease to trouble their heads about me .
here i seem to be mixed up in something and no idea what it is .
nineteen secret history they all stared at the french detective , who smiled back at them .
ive seen to things .
lawrence would say no more , so i decided that i would descend from my high horse , and once more seek out poirot at leastways cottage .
that letter , he resumed when we were pacing along by the river .
twelve years old , i must have been .
he thought again , as he had thought before , that it was her gravity that was so attractive .
he probably went abroad , said anthony thoughtfully .
that sounds , perhaps , an odd thing to say of someone who has lived the life of an invalid for many years and has not left her home here for fifteen years , but it is true .
both for not realizing that the man she may have seen with his hands round janet whites neck was not merely necking her , but might have been killing her .
ive taken that job with the oil company i told you about .
if you like to put it that way , said dr .
i wish i could remember names better .
he was on the trailthat was allon the trail .
but really thats settled .
this morning , not an hour ago , you had a visitor .
nobody could treat you as badly as you deserve .
it is a difficult question , said poirot , shaking his head .
he comes twice a week , drinks a great many cups of tea , does a lot of talking , and notso far as i can seevery much work .
takes care of six presents for christmas .
nothing is impossible , science has taught us that .
but there had been no appropriate station .
whats happening here ?
they had a rather innocent childlike stare .
you dont know how irritating it is .
a fragment of a sermon , indeed !
ascher in that first list of people in andover ?
the tong of the yellow jasmine , perhaps .
well , dont feed her .
odd things crop up in families , said mrs .
well , i know the answer .
and hes been wonderfulhis courage , his pluck !
i have not said that either .
but why an alphabetical complex ?
i intend to earn an honest living .
why didnt they eat the palms of her hands ?
it is most simple .
the door was suddenly flung open and an angelic-looking child in pink pyjamas , powdered with rosebuds , made a dramatic entranceand said in dulcet tones as of one expecting a rapturous welcome its me .
it couldnt be done .
they heard a motor bicycle speeding along .
mademoiselle nick made one mistake .
shes rather too scathing about him , i think !
tell me about the city , he said .
_num_ the night of the tragedy to make this part of my story clear , i append the following plan of the first floor of styles .
he threw a sharp glance at me .
she was perfectly controlled now , but mrs .
she loved her with a very deep and protective love .
on friday letters might be expected to arrive at tommys rooms .
how beautiful trees look with their bare branches against the skyand just a golden leaf or two still hanging .
you are right , monsieur .
thirty-five to forty .
yes , that had got home .
wellno good dwelling on all that now .
it had startled her so ; what she saw !
i wonder if she would have gone on writing if she had not married .
he pushed aside the programme and drank another cup of coffee and went to the window .
in fact it was like bluebells in nature .
come this way , will you , mr .
what did she say to you ?
she slapped paper round my choice .
did it account for the tension he had felt on entering the house last night ?
yes , said poirot , smiling broadly .
he wondered , he wondered very much .
then clarissa gently broke away , but continued to hold his hands .
in answer to his ring , a big slatternly woman , obviously a charwoman , answered the door .
i want to tell you , anthony , but i dont know what youd thinki dont know if youd believe anthony raised a hand and began to check off the fingers .
take it from papa poirot !
and of how miss moncrieff , starting on her travels , had got no further than hayres where , calling to see one of mothers oldest friends , she had been so moved by the plight of an elderly hypochondriac that she had cancelled her travel reservations and taken up her abode in the villa to be bullied , overworked , and to long , wistfully , once more , for the joys of a wider horizon .
now , as she looked more closely , an extraordinary idea rose to her brain .
parker pyne ignored it .
wednesday week .
she looked perplexed .
a short walk brought us to a garage where we were able to obtain a car , and half an hour later we were spinning rapidly back to london .
satterthwaite aside with a shove of the hand and stood shaking in front of mr .
darling , im so sorry .
exquis !
he has plenty of brains when he cares to use them .
i was afraid the boys might be aboutmight hearif i rang up from the hall here .
she wasnt married when she wrote this letter , but shes married now .
the son of one of lord altamounts oldest friends it happens .
i had a sudden vision of myself , a poor innocent boob , swimming in a lake surrounded by evilly disposed crocodiles , all smiling false smiles of amity .
its possible , you see , that she , knowing the house and grounds well , might know some place where you could conceal a body .
yes , said kirsten with a sigh .
i have heard of such thingsthe not due influence ; that is what they call it , no ?
its not idle curiosity on my part .
there are good reasons why a ministry courier cant do the job .
dr graham sounded surprised at the detectives accurate surmise .
india , hong kong , then egypt , and south america , wasnt it ?
everything went well until one of those unforeseen chances occurred .
he stared at her for a minute or two , then he went across and poked at the stove , turning at last in an almost absentminded manner .
now , then , let us attend to the matter in hand .
there were two rugs on the floorgood rugs with lovely dim colour but very worn .
he was a somewhat thick-set , sandy-haired man of about thirty-five , with an outdoor look about him , dressed in a rough tweed suit and dark overcoat and wearing a hat .
with his right hand , he picked up the revolver which had fallen from the others hand as he fell .
nobody knew where he was , therefore he need expect no outside assistance , and must depend solely on his own wits .
orourke .
i thought you might give me a hint or two .
farley was in the habit of working in his own room on the first floor every afternoon .
was she perhaps a witness of some kind , or was it just because she was an interesting case that bartholomew strange had displayed this unusual elation ?
then , in a lightning moment of decision she put up a quickly imagined defence .
what beautiful legs that girl in the short skirt hasthe one who has just come in .
what kind of a calendar ?
then if i may , i will entrust this folder to you .
oo-er , he said .
iyes ; once or twice , said knighton .
i always look very hard at anyone who is above suspicion .
i am an impoverished member of an aristocratic family .
he is due next week .
they could be companions to old ladies , or they could go as nursery governesses to children .
snoooooore , snooooooooregrunt , grunt , grunt .
she feared some accident might have befallen you .
the police are always made out to be as blind as bats in detective stories , said japp with a grin .
before she went to sleep , frankie wrote to bobby .
i dont see what thats got to do with the murder of poor joyce .
an unknown homicidal murderer would not have been thought of !
oliver and mrs .
she was rather pathetically stupid , too .
she loved him and she would have taken him for better or for worse .
but its got nothing to do with the murder .
hastings , what do you say ?
if we knew more even without knowing more , do not certain ideas suggest themselves to you , mon ami ?
asked miss marple curiously .
got a reputation for daring and for not being overscrupulous .
we are now fast approaching the actual drama .
like father , like sonjack renauld , when all is said or done , is the son of georges conneau .
but this was murder .
miss griffith , accepting her cup , thought to herself : i really must speak to mr .
exclaimed heather .
emily brent was left alone sitting in the dining room .
did you go and see this girl mary gerrard in london on the _num_ th at her lodgings ?
and as to anything interesting , i said .
one last fond look before you go ?
i was afraid you or tanios might get in ahead of me .
sir charles cleared his throat .
instructions from beyond _num_ .
iv i went downstairs in a daze .
in and out ?
the interior of the six-wheeler was left clear for the doctor to make his examination .
i ran like a coward up the rest of the road to where the lights were shining in my house , until i pulled myself out of the silly panic that i was in .
rosalie said , youd like to move on to egypt , mother ?
she got it out of whos who .
you always had courage .
devon tours in daffodil coaches , horrible great butter-coloured brutes .
sounds interesting , said father .
giuseppe now .
i remember a casevarious guests in a house party were chatting after dinner .
on arrival at my office , i will describe my next actions carefully .
i grant you your first two , i said .
jacqueline hummed a little tune to herself .
i am not , like the english , romantic .
and was in the process of spilling the beans to him whenwonk !
stick em up !
race asked sharply , is he badly hurt ?
) , and that special cases will have to be made .
when wealth becomes oppressive , that is the only thing to do .
her face looked relieved .
i take it up .
did you know about the passage-way between this room and the library ?
not bundle ?
butmy dear ladywhat can possibly have given rise to such an idea ?
sal volatilesomething like that .
he stared at me for a moment or two and then broke into a strange laugh .
but were newly married , mr .
an acid-looking elderly female then said to me : i think , mrs christie , you will prefer to sit by your husband .
for the momenti could not quite rememberyou see he smiled deprecatinglyi own quite a lot of property in london .
he went on slowly : and we know of someone who was on the other side of the river that nightsomeone who wasnt seen between ten thirty and a quarter past eleven , and who might have been swimming over and back .
later , in the night , i was awakened by the sound of someone moving softly about the room .
everyone must die !
know all about him ?
my wifes name is griseldaa highly suitable name for a parsons wife .
oh , yes , sir , whose elses could it be ?
we must be suretalk it overmake quite certain who could have taken it damned old foolnever made a quick decision in his life !

this for you ?
we brought him home in a cab and the vet was summoned , but scotty died a few hours later .
and he hadnt .
poirot patted her arm .
tanios said , uncertainly : perhaps we can offer you poirot said quickly : you are most amiable , madame , but i have a luncheon engagement for which i am already late .
blackie kept him straight .
in the same way , he lived quite detached from the necessities of daily life .
it would have been quite easy .
her eyes , dark with a kind of smouldering fire , had a queer kind of suffering dark triumph in them .
i did a little shopping in the high street .
you must have some tea , said ellie .
the arrangement was that we should marry and live at the lodge and he should think that the baby was mine .
really i dont see whyi meanwhy should i have anything to do with such a distressing business ?
the inspector examined it , and shrugged his shoulders .
i had thought they would be all right , so i hadnt done them fresh .
lot of old fogies here , im afraid , said colonel luscombe , repeating himself .
its true ?
he had not , somehow , expected lady angkatell , whom up to now he had labelled in his own mind as vague and just a bit batty , to describe a firearm with such technical precision .
told me nothing else ?
i do not propose to give a full account of the experiment .
so does my son .
it already slightly obscured the view of the chest , and as poirot adjusted it , it hid the chest altogether .
ill take him into the council chamber with me if i may .
he made life pretty impossible for everyone in this house , and we all put up with it becauseoh , you know what one says .
nothing to be done .
you are not politically aware , are you ?
convey , i beg of you , the assurance of my deepest respect to lady yardly , and tell her how pleased i am to be able to restore her jewel to her .
colonel melchett said : and what did you do , mr .
theyre up there she gestured towards the bookcase and they still havent been looked through and sorted out .
and she added indignantly : some day ill kill you .
she picked him up .

he chooses a foggy night , hides in the area and waits until your daughter comes up the street .
i feel much better .
are you from scotland yard ?
yes , agreed the colonel .
sunday times : vivacious and entertaining .
she cant be sure of that , said miss waterhouse .
oh , deari knew i should explain things badly .
hori smiled .
you cannot trust me or anybody else .
as a matter of fact , my lady gardener , miss peake , was here , and she offered to show him out through the garden .
frenchmen were all alike , she thought , obsessed by sex !
then , of course , ruth and iris and himself .
that was just routine , was it ?
ive been wrong about her , said mr .
as charlotte she had played second fiddle .
you have told me certain things .
let tomorrow look after itself .
he drew his pad towards him and in small , neat characters made a final entry .
poirot , unable , of course , to resist the occasion , made a little speech .
it used its claws , presumably it took large bites at its prey .
henrietta said : we need not go past the pool .
petherick has been telling us .
je russirai .
why , now i do remember something .
she had charmive felt it .
he only wanted to work on it another day or so .
did anybody else hear the shot in the school building ?
that atmosphere of waiting had brought a release of tension .
was he wrong , or was there the same hush of expectancy there ?
apple bananas were another flavour , i think .
gwenda looked slightly dubiousshe said slowly : i suppose that might be it .
the crale case , monsieur .
she hated the bush and was terrified of the natives and was bored to death .
rafiel has done me very proud !
sometimes it presents no difficulties , said sir stafford nye .
we shall be together , soon .
cartloads of bottles used to be taken out of that house .
supposing that the uranium deposits were on the site of the old blackbird ?
it wasnt a question of giving away the prizes .
i got his reply this morning , and among other things it encloses the official statement of those saved from the lusitania .
id had too bad a shock .
so youre still here , miss marple .
very creditable .
now what does ariadne do ?
the drawing room , sir .
baa , baa , black sheep is among the flock , thinking up devilry hard .
women in satin and pearls .
dontleave she seemed unable to proceed , murmuring something that sounded like sleepy .
he made the slip deliberately , watching her without seeming to do so .
weve sufficient evidence , as im sure youll agree , mr .
i am not in the least anxious to find his murderer .
there were wooden boxes in it , some old hose pipe , a few derelict garden implements , and some broken furniture .
there were three women we hadnt eliminated .
battle smiled .
and he would be useful in a lot of ways .
the old man with the yellow face and the little goatee came up the terrace from the gardens below .
i would not like to go in to her excellency in my dressing gown .
' ' goodnight , carlile .
it was just tiredness .
the two men had indeed passed through the house in question , but their real objective was a small eating house close to the river .
and yetit isnt .
cant move a step without some old hen getting under your feet .
i can tell you why , said jimmy .
elsie holland , megan and symmington were there having tea .
there were three of you , said dermot .
i saw you with ted bigland at the end of the street .
seven the rajahs emerald the rajahs emerald was first published in red magazine , _num_ july _num_ .
what should you say now to _num_ down , and all expenses paid ?
when i came back to it , would it be the same thing ?
they were going , i heard , to a zoo at marseilles , and i felt sad about them : they were so completely teddy-bearish .
through the open door to the kitchen he could hear miss pebmarsh busy at the sink .
i must say im surprised at young reddingdoing it the way he did .
i was going to lucerne to a congress .
robert is in the army .
to leave a thing like that .
this is a decent well-run hostel .
the mistress of littlegreen house _num_ .
dont you lose heart .
shes been thoroughly overhauled .
there was also quite an artist colony living all around .
youre very kind , said miss marple , but i dont think today i feel quite strong enough for expeditions .
it concerns a young lady .
poirot proceeded : it is that you come home from india on what is called the leavewhat we call en permission ?
after all , its not very big , this village .
it was evident that i had managed to put my foot in it badly , so i hastily changed the subject .
a fellow tells me to signi sign .
poirot , whilst with frobisher , had been impressed by the others restlessness , nervousness and irritabilityall the signs of intense mental strain .
the one man they were afraid ofmyselfis out of the way .
although , often , peculiar things may be the merest trifles .
in a year well be back where we werewith wages up , workers unwilling , everybody dissatisfied and nobody knowing where they are .
but im glad to see you look uncomfortable .
starkwedder replied coldly .
my mother , my little sister poirot cut short the flood of reminiscence .
and afterwards , so i have learned , she sits in the sick room alone with her aunt while you and the nurses are at dinner .
certainly , said anthony .
i have known crimes that were artisticthey were , you understand , supreme exercises of imagination .
owen didnt realize .
tell me what to do !
good-looking girl , he said .
as she uttered the last sentence a feeling rose in mr .
would you just step this way , mr .
they had searched woods , dragged ponds .
she felt indeed a pleasurable excitement .
recognize any of them ?
everyone else was talking .
so is mine a good job .
i walked home slowly and did a good deal of thinking .
if only , i said , the letter hadnt been dated miss marple nodded her head .
let us make inquiries at yonder post office .
what about the valet ?
the trouble with her is that either she thinks that at last shes got to that spot or place or that moment in her life where everythings like a fairy tale come true , that nothing can go wrong , that shell never be unhappy again ; or else shes down in the dumps , a woman whose life is ruined , whos never known love and happiness and who never will again .
he paused and added , richard baker grabbed him and disarmed him .
mais oui , cest une ide , a .
christow knew her .
i was slightly hazy as to what bad legs were .
game and poultry appeared on the table sometimes , causing mrs .
youve no idea whether its a man or a woman ive to look for ?
the mushrooms were quite all right , mr .
nobody did .
for this reason , too , she found it difficult to be fond of the two children .
she had an intelligent , sensitive face , with light-grey eyes of a peculiar and searching intensity .
we are all doomed .
then he caught me by the arm .
all by yourself to the middle east ?
quite , he said .
there was silence and nobody spoke .
shes been bombarding me with letters about you .
' it would be unadvisable to treat her as a fool , ' agreed poi ?
youve no idea , neele , how tired one gets of the inevitable weed killer .
there was a silence , and then edward said : well , midge dear , what about it ?
ruth had better give it a couple more years , then i shall be lord leconbury , and she can be chtelaine of leconbury , which is what she married me for .
not until she had exhausted the subject of what she herself had felt , and what the doctor had said , and how kind mr .
did you ever read fairy stories when you were a child ?
he said with a sort of groan : she is lovely , isnt she ?
give me the memoirs , and you shall go unscathed .
one must go not by ones feelings but by facts .
it wasnt the evidence .
major palgrave could have kept it in a draweror a dispatch-case , something like that .
that is what im anxious to find out , mrs .
that is shown by the fact that lady westholme came to see if miss pierce was awake and found her sitting in the entrance of her tent .
oh , noshes entirely on my side .
demanded james ferociously .
reassure yourself , said poirot .
assuredly , they will not leave the matter there .
in that case , said hercule poirot , he is superior to most human beings !
it is not , somehow , just as i thought .
this explains allthe ease with which they surrendered .
there he installed me in a chair , and i related the whole story , keeping back nothing , and omitting no circumstance , however insignificant , whilst he himself made a careful and deliberate toilet .
then we used to have music charles had got a very good stereophonic gramophone .
but , jackie , youre staying .
and shes getting worse .
i believe she did .
presently , they heard a shot .
yes , i should think you might .
cornelia ruth .
are you going to run away tonight too ?
but how can i keep calmhow can i help feeling but we must all keep calm , roger .
im sure thats not so , i said indignantly .
i must go now , she said .
thomasmotive .
not if you saw her write it herself .
colonel carbury , leaning inelegantly against the bed which had been pushed against the wall , smiled as he puffed at his pipe .
she came up to the stretcher .
lord whitfield resumed his pacing .
and of course he had a way with him , as ive been telling you .
that was a nice surprise .
but its so silly .
sheppard met had an american accent , which fitted in with that supposition .
the force of her objection lay in the fact that she knew her mother-in-law to be dead at the time .
i have still got that small flat tin of benzedrine : i have never used it .
but in so doing has sharpened your vision .
so he sent you , did he ?
its going to the international group .
lucilla attributed it to a glass or so too much of port .
the valet did not hear his master return but about ten minutes later , major rich looked into the kitchen and told burgess to hurry out and get some turkish cigarettes which were mrs .
i rather want to know more about the turners , said lavington quietly .
the possibility has been in my mind from the first , admitted poirot .
when youve had your nice tea and your boiled egg and your toast and butter , well see .
which means that we shall have to act quickly , said mr .
hed swear the man wasnt straight .
no point in bringing her north and ive no idea where lansquenet is buried , somewhere in france i believe .
' ' that would be a pity , ' said lord mayfield .
without her i felt miserably inadequate .
trouble with father !
he started to investigateand he died .
when we go and help there , he chivvies us girls something terrible .
behind him , rosaleen gave a little frightened gasp .
she was a slim attractive blonde her husband , alec , had a badly sunburnt face and untidy red hair .
james bentley was thinking of hunters close , of the life that went on there , of whether or not it was an unhappy house .
rupert , dear , dont talk nonsense , said his mother .
very heavy .
my father was naturally musical .
at old bantrys ?
a lean , elderly man , mr .
no , indeed she didnt .
she was on an island crossing whitehall .
all she would say was that there hadnt been any harm in it .
youll see .
how very odd !
the net result was not entirely a blank .
battle went round to the front of the house , and a few minutes later anthony and virginia heard the sound of a car driving away .
do you a lot more good to walk , he added .
it was the person we have called the second murdererthe left-handed personin other words the woman in the scarlet kimono .
absolutely plumb certain .
the archdeacon went on , his voice low and sad .
a little morea little more stillwould it never be finished ?
was he very devoted to his mother ?
jean lingered , clearly wanting to be told more .
) then homeand an alibisince you had timed the dictaphone for half past nine .
tanios and his wife stayed there for easter ?
you didnt like her ?
of course , said tommy .
he does not belong to our branch of the family .
ah , all is well , there she is .
he shot out at me .
he stared at her , for the first time he looked faintly puzzled .
oh do be quiet , said ellie , i want to tell you .
it does not make sense .
i dont like to speak ill of the deadbut there it is .
do you mean has anyone attempted my life in the last two days ?
when can you get the jar ?
were you fond of her ?
you have been in court since the beginning of these proceedings ?
local people will perhaps be able to spot who it was whos been following you about , finding out things about you .
if a childs racquet was missing , what of it ?
no one could definitely say : that is not so he did not reply , and the countess continued to look out dreamily across the bay .
battle has insulted the cook , i expect .
it was no longer a question now of a small paragraph hidden away in the corner of the papers .
and in the grate were the identical four knobs of coal i had carefully spilt there .
she is different .
they bowed to each other .
yes , she admitted .
said bryan .
they both looked grey and unsubstantial in the fading light .
i will say just one thing more .
one of the old school he was , and proud as lucifer .
i hear you can tell me about gipsys acre up there , i said .
at that moment a tap came at the door , and a young officer entered with a heavily sealed envelope which he handed to lord estair .
its always that might be possible under certain conditionsit would depend on the pathological condition of the recipientsuch cases have been knowna lot depends on individual idiosyncrasyall that sort of stuff .
i dont care to feel im a tiresome old woman spoiling other peoples pleasure .
but go right ahead .
richard , ages since we met .
oh , this is from the ritz !
lucy came in and shut the door .
if even she didnt blame me , why shouldwhy should this awful thing be said ?
john is john christow , dr .
getting softthats the curse of the present day .
it is fortunate for his wife , then , that there is this life insurance .
cust sprang up abruptly .
doubtless he meant to relock the communicating door also , but perhaps he heard some movement from the bed and it startled him .
in the _num_ s .
raoul laughed .
the attention of everyone was , of course , focused on the murdered man .
dont you think that you are making rather a fuss about nothing , m .
his voice was faint , an old mans voice , a far-away voice .
but it wasnt awfully well taught .
i must know soon .
could have been chucked there from one of the back windows .
they were perfectly all right .
theres bloodblood everywhere .
she can put it to herself that way , certainly .
bridgets eyebrows went up a fraction .
ahem !
were keeping her with us , said sylvia .
she caught up a towel and tried again .
it fits , said neele heavily , but all the same the sequence is wrong .
i know , madre , i know .
then ask his sister , said poirot , gently nodding his head over her shoulder .
travers has got it now .
colonel johnson said soothingly : quitequite , figure of speech , that was all .
tuppence went upstairs to her room .
if mademoiselle nick dies he said , and made a threatening gesture with his hand .
he was , she thought , rather like the actors she had seen in wild west films .
to speak the truth , i know very little .
instead they all died .
you mean that shed rather the husband killed the wife , or the wife killed the husband ?
well , she must put mr .
and she was a very determined woman .
hes a murderer all right !
renisenb looked at him sharply .
why , my hairs grey .
instinct cannot be infallible .
he said abruptly : whats that , there ?
violencebreakagenoise .
you dont like gipsies , said ellie .
i soon realized that my husband simply had got to die , but i didnt know how to set about it .
corrigan laughed .
he went on : ' did you both occupy the same bedroom ?
the waves of pale shimmering hair , the curving mouththe platinum foxes that swathed her shoulders and the long sweep of white velvet underneath them .
elspeth mcgillicuddy doesnt imagine things , said miss marple .
go , and make the arrangements .
hubbard murmured : please to meet you , im sure , to all three of them in an abstracted manner , and then plunged once more into her recital .
good evening , mr .
then you told me that the man had disappeared .
what you want ?
on reception of poirots name he was told that dr .
had she really got evidence of importance , or that she thought of importance , to offer ?
victoria had a kind of hallucination that it was herself who was approaching .
alistair blunt spoke soothingly as he rose to greet poirot .
and i thought he was out for a walk .
he got it down and snapped back the lock .
its a knack .
you meant that bunny had been going to buy a new bottle that day , and so she ought not to have needed to take letitias ?
too much might hang upon it .
what can i do for you , m .
a packet of senna pods stood open at one end .
yes ; you see she went to the mater , andoh , heres evie herself .
in the morning poirot seemed strangely disinclined to stir out .
its not the kind of setup that im looking for .
you are ready , my child ?
i feel the whole time as though i was going about in a dream .
well , not quite managing him , but perhaps a little more than he knew i was .
that i cared .
fortescue just a necessary part of the office dcorwhich was all very luxurious and very expensive .
he fancied , but was not sure , the same gowns on the two women .
asked norman .
with a little nod she passed out into the brilliant sunshine .
it didntoh , it didnt seem to make sense , somehow .
this is sergeant hay .
it is not beauty that makes every head (except one) turn on the beach to look at her .
in the meantime ill follow out his instructions .
youve had the laugh of me too many times .
dont be indelicate .
jane was usually good for a handful of sultanas , or a slice of cheese , but suggested firmly that these should be consumed in the garden .
medenham grange , which lay just a mile outside the village , had belonged to the lees for many generations .
poirot in his turn , spoke .
i was captured .
thats catherine .
self pity is one of the biggest stumbling-blocks in the world today .
are you quite mad , m .
thats unusual for meand it upsets me i know what id like to dobut i feel that to hand over to someone without the necessary experience wouldnt be fair to the school .
but i think my cousin just came in here .
so hearty .
she was the broken-hearted one , i gather .
you must be sensible .
oh , absolutely , sir .
the question is , if he was murdered , who murdered him ?
you are not pleased with me , mon ami ?
she may have had an infatuation for jacko , but she never loved him .
wellwere talking about human beings , not dogs .
there must be , if necessary , a scapegoat .
josie said slowly : it isnt the sort of place and broke off .
out on the island somewhere ?
i dont care , i dont care .
when did you last see him , mr waverly ?
it was at that moment that curtiss came through the doorway wheeling poirot in his invalid chair .
suiting the action to the word , he threw away the match he had just blown out , and ran lightly and noiselessly round the corner of the boathouse .
evening dresses were great items in my life ; carefully tended and preserved , cleaned , mendedand here it was being thrown about like a football .
a thin elderly man stood up from where he had been kneeling by the body and gave a nod .
i dont suppose you will be taking up any post again now , will you ?
shes flouted the traditions of government houseshes played merry hell with precedence at dinner parties (and that , midge , is a black crime !
and do you still grudge rosaleen and myself our ill-gotten access to wealth ?
upward when young , since she assumes as a matter of course that mrs .
it took a long time to perfect our plan .
here , with the trickling of the water , the soft peaty smell in the air and the warm colouring of bracken and heather , a world of murder and police inquiries and suspicion seemed blotted out as though it had never existed .
just as well or better than a young woman out of an office could dowhat does she know about housekeeping ?
wimborne in an injured voice .
you may think , gentlemen , that mary riley or draper may have had some perfectly legitimate reason for changing her name to hopkins .
im not a drug fiend , deari just like to see what these things are like .
it was reported vaguely that several young men had been asked to come to the police station and assist the police .
was your wife there in the dining room during the meal ?
it is possible , mademoiselle , he said in french , that you may suit .
she is neither meek nor submissive .
a wonderful girl who was out of this world meant something urgent and important .
it was ten oclock before she took in the fact that no .
mary was just off the market square .
you had an ayah , dear .
i do not like italians .
where is the lady now ?
i wonder what exactly her fancies are and why .
a minute or two later a big fair-haired man with a sunburnt face entered the room .
do you know who you remind me of ?
the colonel was staring at the clock .
another womans voice , indifferent , cold , spoke , was uninterested .
unless they were washed away ?
sir henry sat still , watching her tall , slender figure wander down the path .
oliver or some member of the household to whom she may have lent her key , and , third , someone whom marlene herself admitted to the room .
and that is dangerous .
she lowered her voice and leaned forward again .
thats what i should like to know .
and you see the significance ?
david shrugged his shoulders .
im sick of this country , and of the city .
well , charles , i hope we shant have a crime this weekend .
she was smiling .
but i am telling you what george barton said .
it doesnt really have anything to do with anything .
not even now ?
at that moment your world crashed around you .
hemming ?
christian gulbrandsen spent his morning with dr .
she came in about ten o ' clock .
gilliatt , we had a new stock arrived in yesterday .
no , im of the opinion that our late lamented mr .
i arrived here for christmas on the saturday before , didnt i ?
whove i got to say that to ?
with an amiable little bow he was always amiable he left the room and wandered out into the big square hall of mon repos .
you permit , maam ?
why , yes , i should think it would be very enjoyable .
i have , perhaps , too professional a point of view where deaths are concerned .
my indifference piqued the good woman .
what have you to say for yourself about it ?
that is good news , is it not ?
my neighbours are all pleasant folk , but theyve no ideas beyond this island .
their aunts and their older sisters looked after them .
a voice said , is that lady edgware ?
as a matter of fact , i think she is telling the truth .
hercules voice interrupted him .
the guide led it up , and occasionally picking little bunches of flowers , handed them to me to stick in my hatband .
my dear , my very dear roger , a life calls for a life .
oh yesim pretty sure of it .
dont you think any of these lines will lead to anything ?
ive read his book .
i just said it was odd .
harry shook his head .
but it can be frighteningvery frightening .
i suppose it was in a way , said miss brewis , but one cant have everything , can one ?
then what do you think ?
i meant to make good and i have made good .
yet beautiful women had been known to poison .
that might be true , but would ratchett have taken one last night ?
i saw through her .
a brandy and soda perhaps ?
now then , is everything all right ?
i put my fancy down to the fact that the decorations were so flashy and unnatural for the countryl when we could afford to have it done up in a country style , without all this panelling and paint and gilt , then i said , it would feel quite different .
i have had other ideas concerning this father , he went on .
i just thought thatwell , the less fuss well , of course , ellie dear , you have something there .
smart bit of work .
if you will give me the details ?
then miss brewis , contemptuous : lady stubbs was not to be found .
before hastings had time to react to poirots cryptic announcement , the door opened and edward raynor entered the room .
perhaps youd better !
' ' and- ?
i should say youd had your lesson .
the two englishmen were listening politely , if without great interest .
and a date inside it .
she has no money of her own , so she cannot leave him for some time i have been undecidedbut now i have made up my mind .
i went home much relieved in mind .
because you wanted to follow out some line of your own unobserved .
life must be dreary for herand it was true that she worked like a drudge and that no one was ever grateful .
im planning to go there shortly , and so is miss hetherington .
i dont think ive got anything as old as this one of yours , though .
he was looking at lola valdez .
a crime can be a work of art .
you must know what i mean .
and there was someone with a motive , and miss blacklock knew it , said miss marple .
because i do think , miss savernake , that a girl owes it to herself to make a stand about these sort of thingsif you know what i mean .
so aunt cora started her rough sketch down there , i expect , and then finished it surreptitiously later at home from a postcard !
men always think they can impose upon women , she said .
now do as i say and dont argue .
he waited a minute or two , but margery did not give way .
and pondering these resolutions in his mind mr .
vera said : you mean and paused .
oh , there probably will be .
just a lot of rubbish , it looks .
were conservative , you know , conservative to the backbone .
and with a glow of quiet appreciation her eyes dropped to the exquisite , costly simplicity of her own french white linen .
these affairs are always rather unpleasant .
yellow in the face they go and the whites of their eyes ah , yes , indeed (anecdote of poirots cousin who appeared to have been the yellow peril in person .
in another minute he was shaking hands with them both in his correct , rather prim fashion , and had accepted the shy invitation proffered him to have tea with them .
asked alfred .
to put it bluntly , mrs .
my mug ?
there was no sadness in her voice .
michael doesnt know yet .
a comforting sense of importance oozed into him .
you must consider your health .
welman and live there .
youre not married .
not awfully apt to be useful to us .
brown already be assembling against them ?
then , with polite remarks on either side , the search party withdrew .
what do you suggest i should do ?
thats a well cut suit the mother has on .
it is late , i know , getting on for two oclock .
richmond , said virginia thoughtfully .
an indignant denial to that monstrous suggestion .
i must say that that was a very penetrating remark of the inspectors , alexs voice cut in on her meditations .
he seemed curiously averse to begin .
she might have gone peculiar or something .
he said , carefully weighing the words : you must have resented thisattitudeon her behalf ?
we had lunch at port erin , and then started on our search .
it made me feel creepy , as you call it , replied the other .
she had taken steps to deal with the situation .
' ' no , i couldn ' t , ' his mother replied decisively .
poirot asked : did anyone see him go ?
but she only followed you a few minutes later .
you seem a bright sort of girl .
well , because if she , mary jordan , was here to find out something , and if she did find out something , then perhaps when theyi mean commander x or other peoplethere must have been other people too in itwhen they found out that shed found out something now dont get me muddled again , said tuppence .
it surprised me to be sent for .
dieu merci , i am not of an ardent temperament .
also white but it was stamped with green shamrocks all over .
i knew that one as a child .
and now mr .
the latter said breathlessly : i was afraid you might have gone to bed sarahs manner was carefully matter-of-fact .
listened to poor old underhay raving about his district and the great wide-open spacesand breathed out , wasnt it wonderful ?
safer , said peters .
they be gone round to the majors , said mr .
im sure id work my fingers to the bone for you and the missus .
ideas at once more dignified and more probable .
i can hardly bear to think of it .
within that circle of persons was the hand that had actually done the deedno matter whose the inspiration had been .
lady horbury was lunching at home .
by the door , theodora stood , a black shadow with a white face .
the fat hand was extended towards him .
ryan on his war experiences was apt , as i knew , to be unbelievably long-winded .
marchaud !
oh yes , it has , said mr .
and finished with it ?
organized crime , barton , thats what i always say when im asked .
iii marina gregg received craddock in a room on the first floor , which was obviously her own private sitting room opening out of her bedroom .
i think , perhaps , what i am meant to think .
mortimer broke off a twig from a tree near by .
you will forgive my troubling you , i trust , said poirot .
it seemed , she thought , very real .
you know what i asked you just now .
clever chap , i should say , but a thorough frog , isnt he ?
you cannot play tennis with a forehand drive alone .
thats all nonsense and you know it , said mrs .
what would you do without me to look after you ?
twelve per cent , murmured major burnaby .
tommy gave a much abridged explanationshe looked at him doubtfully .
on no account must you move from that chair .
it had a poor railway service , and was therefore not at all the sort of place people came to , either from oxford or from london .
the weapon found in the wound was a stiletto dagger which had been lying on mrs .
ted bigland nodded .
dont wriggle .
i have read ityesit is in the newspaper !
there were some original shares of mortauld .
tuppence felt a terrific rise in her spirits .
a wave of human sympathy rushed over her .
i had a talk with winterspoon .
a very clever man , i believe .
sandra had said quickly ; of course , it would be delightful .
didnt like my overcalling , i expect .
she isnt aimless .
im her mother .
' i was - now let me see .
partly that and partly because she hopes uncle alistair might get fond enough of me to leave me his money when he dies .
thick layers of dust apparently undisturbed .
you do think you know about everything , said her husband .
you had already deduced something of the kind , had you not ?
he added : youve been out , edith ?
' he paused .
after surveying this melancholy landmark of a past age for a minute or two in silence , he walked up the steps to the front door and pressed the bell , glancing as he did so at the neat wrist-watch which had at last replaced ap .
peters , standing near her , seemed to sense her reaction .
besides , i always had a hope of finding a way out through the countess .
well , not if it was pouring with rain , naturally .
really , rosalind !
treves dressed himself carefully with overcoat and muffler , and after renewed goodnights he and ted latimer set out together .
i went up to bed .
' ' why shouldn ' t it ?
he returned painfully to life , his head aching .
come out on the terrace , said mrs .
he might have thought of itbut i warned him off before he could try !
she said quietly , hating herself , but steadfast in her purpose : im going to marry david hunter , rowley .
i do not want a lawyer .
superintendent sugden said : but he hadnt time , mr .
no shots ?
the people there last night were all big guns , they were none of them close friends of hers and some of them didnt know each other .
but in my opinion , the enemy theory is not tenable , for you see , inspector , arlena marshalls enemies would , i think , as i said just now , always be women .
but griselda , i wish you would be a little more careful in what you say .
i have to go to the bank , too .
no , said dr .
i do not really know what fatigue is .
he returned a minute later .
well , she had been at the inquest this morning and she had seen you there , and she must have had some reason for coming to wilbraham crescent .
oh no , theyre not yours , sir .
he gettee free .
and see you got your own way ?
pengelleys visit to him .
it is you who should look after the children and do womans work in the back of the house .
its always been a bit of a trial to me , she said .
perennas beds had never been unduly soft , this could not be of coursehaydock !
if i gambled , i won .
small , yellow , wrinkled , old , she stared unbelievingly into the smiling eyes of mr .
worrying about miss conway .
whats all this , eh ?
but look here , adele , weve got to be careful .
it was only a fleeting impression .
when once id met linnetjackie didnt exist .
she came round all right .
i stopped him touching her .
but your coming here by chance like thiswell , its too good to be missed .
they were mostly country types standing around .
how idiotic !
always used to go and see pigs killed .
she swept up the stones , took them to the washstand and thrust them into her sponge bag and rammed her sponge and nail brush down on top of them .
then the knowledge is dangerous to you , hori ?
i am starting a guest house of my own on an island off the coast of devon .
inspector neeles voice still sounded incredulous .
one always remembers that .
no , not that i am aware of .
are you really asking me ?
but i saw in the newspaper this morning that the duke of merton had returned to merton house .
as i took my hand from the mans shoulder i found it was wet and redi can assure you , gentlemen , the shock was terrific !
they went upstairs to change .
jeremy looked up .
i would rather notjust at present .
and yet her calmness was so evident that he could not believe she was lying to him .
well , its gone on ever since .
he tapped the gun with his knife .
he drew out another letter with a german stamp upon itwritten by a young singer in whom he had interested himself .
i mean the people of your five cases .
to see for ourselves , my friend .
ssh , here he comes .
his stomach was pleasantly rounded , his head resembled an egg in shape , and his moustaches curved upwards in a flamboyant flourish .
i next considered the problem of miss arundells death .
is there anything you know that would assist us at all ?
one cannot go against the spirit of the times .
some of the things she said today .
he got a kick out of it .
when was the last stop ?
_num_ , japp wasted no time in beating about the bush .
or come from it ?
parfaitement , parfaitementyou feel the natural delicacy .
inglethorps door .
i meant this wren .
just one more slice .
tuppence said quickly : if you ask me , i dont think hes got anything to do with it .
i shall be just over there .
it was not , she felt , at all what gordon cloade himself would have envisaged .
and then she says thats all .
yesshe was taking no risks of that kind .
how did you know it ?
here comes our american sleuth , m .
asked tuppence , marvelling at the things that seemed to happen , and to centre round the peaceful-looking village of sutton chancellor .
is that agreed ?
why should you mention mrs .
thats why you could have knocked me down with a feather when , the next afternoon , those people came running out calling for the police and saying thered been murder done .
driving through those enormous stretches of flat pasture land , with nothing to break the horizon except periodic windmills , i realised how frightening it could be : how easy to get lostbushed , as the saying was .
she sounded incredulous .
all the discoveries have been made by japp , and japp will take all the credit .
for me , my arrival at styles st .
you cant disentangle what they remember from what they invent .
there was a spark of anger now underlying her nervousness .
was there such a thing as a world of romance and adventure somewhere ?
everything had been so settled , so secure .
said pamela again .
it didnt give much light and the suni think the sun must have set a long time ago .
no expense spared , no signs of an individual taste .
our interview proceeded on the lines indicated .
after dinner this evening , mr .
yes , but they fitted in , said tuppence .
ah , yes , where the folly stands now ?
there were white flowers arranged on the coverlet , and the room had been tidied and set to rights .
yes , madame ?
he is certainly the most likely suspect .
then he cautiously pulled at a rusty chain and a shrill little bell tinkled briskly inside the door .
' ' it ' s pat i ' m thinking about mostly , ' said ]immy .
thats for you to say , sir , said battle significantly .
i couldnt go on with ithow could i ?
ah , there you are , he remarked .
if a stranger came in from outside he could only do so in disguise .
i think he came ashore by the boathouse and that she slipped down there to meet him .
yes , i do , though .
not that he himself would undertake a sea voyagenot for any inducement .
it is true that she comes out this way fairly often .
he caught hold of the back of a chair to steady himself , and waved the page boy from the room .
john used to come and talk , do you see ?
but i tell you , my friend , she is an allumeuse .
your shakespeare !
it lay on the palm of his hand , blinking in the light .
mcnaughton wheeled the wheelbarrow to a small shed beside it .
they areeven when they try to be clever .
satterthwaite thought to himself : but she wasnt sure hed comeshe wasnt sure at all .
what did major knighton ring up about ?
anyway , it seemed very odd .
it might be kindly meant , but miss marples action savoured , very faintly , of interference .
and of course shed looked after him , too .
peter lord said slowly : i hope youre not going to suggest that line trying to rake up things about a harmless young woman whos dead and cant defend herself and , anyway , i dont believe you can do it !
' ' it has been a pleasant day , ' said poirot .
pengelley .
someone was fumbling with the lock of the door .
what , for the matter of that , would the angkatells think ?
and so we come to the last member of the gangwe come to the man known as number four .
egg came over to mr .
he had glanced at his own watch then and had noted that it was just one minute after the time of their appointment .
if i am right i shall know in another half hour .
then , feeling the lack of a more substantial breakfast than she had had , she turned into a local caf .
raymond billiard room .
so she was full of it .
jane wilkinsons idea of a rag was a gossamer negligee which revealed more than it hid .
dark blue oxford and pale blue cambridge .
mrs clapperton unlocked the door and let the murderer in .
the daughter was mixed-up with a young man whom her father didnt want her to marry .
i saw a good many flaws in carolines theory , but i forebore to point them out to her .
seventeen in the last litter , i remember .
i have been content to drift along knowing i was an utter failure , without caring much , just living from day to day .
what he said , replied julius dryly .
what a horribly accurate mind-reader you are .
he died with his name tarnished .
so in due course we started , laden with quantities of tomans and given our credentials by the russian consulate , who were quite adamant about not letting us get off at tiflis .
got a network out .
presently , moving up a little , rowley was able to address beatrice in a quiet voice : got a stranger staying here ?
and its more peaceful than the beach here .
on one side , set back from the road , was a row of newly built council houses , a strip of green in front of them and a gay note set by each house having been given a different coloured front door .
whats the matter , alice ?
it will take some time , and its a good climb up again .
they came out on the heath , and a breath of cool , invigorating air fanned theos cheeks .
oh yes , clarissa replied with a smile .
thomas raised his shoulders .
' ' that is so .
but i try to get down for weekends whenever i can .
who would succeed him ?
asked the colonel , as we rang the bell .
cades .
that is the occupational disease of dictators : wanting to be god .
after some delay , anthony was received by a pale and exquisitely dressed underling with an engaging manner , and a military title .
heres josephine back .
you will notice , my friend , that , in your summary of where we stand , you have not attempted to answer that point .
not very much .
they are not important .
andy darling , i must see you againnobody has ever mattered to me but youyou havent really forgotten me , either , have you ?
do you think he ?
i understand you went out soon after lunch yesterday ?
crale was really completely wrapped up in her husband .
imhotep squared his shoulders and took a deep breath , relaxing his devout funeral expression .
if youre always on the make , it does tell in the end .
is there nothing to account for your daughters sudden change of plan ?
the sternness of his tone surprised her .
each time , when she came back from those visits to ainswick , which were the wild delight of her life , she would answer the faint deprecating questions in her fathers tired face by flinging her arms round his neck and saying : im glad to be homeim glad to be home .
rising , he went to his desk , unlocked it and took out the letter lucie adams had sent him from america .
never a word .
the evidence of the valet _num_ .
so you fell for that stuff , did you ?
she was a mass of nerves , twitching all over , yet i had the greatest difficulty in making her tell me what the trouble was .
you had better bring the girl into the house , she said decisively .
anyway , some sort of fishy name like that .
most of the family were there , sir .
but a short story is not a play .
cayman , weeping crocodile tears and recognizing body as that of a convenient brother .
sometimes miss halliwell would make remarks that seemed a little ambiguousnot entirely relevant to the matter in hand .
hes wrapped up in the family history , and hes superstitious to the last degree .
there was a good deal of chinafragile shepherds and shepherdesses .
even after her death , ten years later , when as inheritor of her vast wealth he might have been supposed to cut loose , he did not marry again .
she could have as much as she liked of everything .
charles , tall and good-looking , with his slightly mocking manner , said : hullo , aunt emily , hows the girl ?
and unless the truth is found out , those three are going to remain under the terrible shadow of doubt .
gasping for breath and somewhat bewildered , hercule poirot followed .
that would be easyquite easyif one really wanted to clare laughed .
being in the dead country its difficult to get maids , and the girls they have got are a raw lot , and some of them not too obliging , and though im sure im never one to give trouble , meals sent up on a tray should at least be hot , and no facilities for boiling a kettle , and the tea not always made with boiling water !
why , i said , id play a joke on the king in buckingham palace and risk lse majest ?
one , two , buckle my shoe _num_ .
is this the priests place ?
shell swallow anything !
i find girls very perplexing , said lady coote .
we went down again to alderbury .
i enjoyed the vicars sermon last sunday , and i enjoyed the singing too .
and there is much wet weather in this country .
oliver reassuringly .
i say i dont believe it .
half the battle is the impression the accused makes on the jury .
a good cooks a good cookand when you lose her , its as much to you as her pearls are to some fine lady .
nothing serious or tragic .
i meant the use of the word us .
no good looking at that other door behind me .
im sorry youre not coming with us .
my mother said quickly , its all right , darling .
i was amused at his appointment to take lettice to see the operations .
philip stopped .
i will approach from the other side so as not to disturb these footprints .
old .
the younger teuton was white with passion .
shes a bithysterical .
nothing like having quick reflexes , seizing your opportunity .
rafiel swore .
i can assure you that i have no knowledge as to where the girl is .
all my mothers eager , warm , impulsive personality was far away somewhere .
someone has turned the comedy into a tragedy .
im afraid im not very good poirot interrupted her .
they ' d been wiped off very carefully with a silk handkerchief .
the family name , it is a passion with him ?
he said slowly : in murder cases , as you know , charles , the obvious is usually the right solution .
hardman took it in his hand .
but there is only sixty here .
bantry now and find out what it was she wanted .
the woman said she had the miniatures all right .
he was in the secret service then ?
and now to resume your so dramatic narrative , said poirot .
ah yes , i see i made a note on my pad .
you frightened anne morisot by telling her that if she came forward at once to proclaim her identity she would certainly be suspected of the murder .
direction will be given me .
it was my neighbour at lunch , the rev .
i dont know what _num_ means .
mitzi turned off the taps and as she did so two hands came up behind her head and with one swift movement forced it down into the water-filled sink .
townor where ?
i know he wont ask me .
to begin with , he loves his wife louise with an overpowering passion such as only a woman of her kind can evoke .
yes , undoubtedly the hand of mr .
what words ?
hallidays death and to account for its origin i am quite convinced we have to go back a long wayto some childish experience .
motive : possibly arising out of association with dead man ?
money was wanted desperately , for the three youngest children were delicate and wanted expensive medical treatment .
yes , i was thinking of something .
my daughter said id have an easy journey , but somehow i dont feel happy about it .
his face was impassivea poker face .
but the stepmother is not murdered .
there had been , he now recollected , a curious nervous intensity in the voicea tremor that spoke of some intense emotional strain .
ill show you what you can look like if you try .
she said in a dull voice : yesthere was a man in it .
well , no one in a scarlet dressing gown came into my compartment .
down where the rose garden is now .
miss eyelesbarrow , can i speak to you about something ?
lucy was always so clever , she said .
he said : youre one of the loveliest , crudest , most flamboyant bits of exotic colouring ive ever seen .
his delicate hint that later , when i was married , i wouldnt feel the loss of my bet , was proof of that .
i think , too , that , in spite of many other adventures , he always loved her .
bullets had gone all round nurse and the children , and she came back somewhat shaken .
two boxes , murmured poirot .
jane put her hand to her aching head and tried to think .
i dont like that word .
be patient and calm , and disguise your feelings .
why not , easterbrook ?
its rather up to you , archie said .
did i not tell you you would misunderstand ?
i asked , startled .
gwenda exclaimed : perhaps he followed her back here ?
as i did so , i stumbled just a little and i saw santonix frown .
i feel sorry for her .
my friend , an occasion stupendous , unprecedented , never to be repeated , has presented itself !
lots of the kids in the street had been evacuated with their mums .
i took the bottle i wanted and went off with it .
she could retire into herself , be quiet , gentle , aloof , disappointing to an eager fan .
selby coughed .
having supper with una .
but if so , if the shot was fired then , why did everyone say it was earlier ?
a small , shrewd man , less easy to be sure about than his wife .
through the window comes a shaft of moonlight , and with it the motif of pierrots long-forgotten song .
said sybil , speaking to the doll .
charles grinnedan engaging grinand said : lucky its only lawson .
she came up to the picture , bent down and peered at it closely .
he looked as embarrassed as though he had been accused of the most deadly of sins .
give a chap time .
i shall look after myself .
reilly ?
half in trust to his wife for her lifetime , the other half to his son .
hawes glanced at me sideways .
henceyou are to be banished .
yeslast night .
its too terrible , she sobbed , and , brushing past frankie , she ran out of the room .
when .
just said the fellow was out for his blood and meant to get it .
he was suspicious , had always been suspicious , of mercytoo much mercy , that is to say .
eh , crome , whats your opinion ?
at last we neared the scene of the excavations .
youve done everything for me .
although grown up , they had been very kind to me , knowing that i was alone at ashfield because the doctor had ordered my mother abroad for change and rest .
sobek and the snake .
you dont seem to realise , inspector sharpe , that i was a friend of celias .
, nowadays have this kind of basis .
not like the man , not like him at all .
yes , she said in a low voice .
on the whole , he said , keeping an hotel has some advantages over keeping a country house .
a spark of anger showed in his eyes .
and miss bellever ?
i have arranged for that .
i felt that i had no right to burden poirot with this , my purely personal problem .
owen griffith got redder still .
and where were you ?
the colonel , hercule poirot noticed , accompanied her back to her compartment .
without doubt she will be very much upset by monsieur renaulds death , and we may be fortunate enough to get a clue from her .
he had evidently come straight off the steamer .
ah well , age will tell .
the beauty of nasse house appealed to him in spite of himself .
no , i dont , said max .
nine years ?
as these friendly reminiscences were being indulged in , i drew nearer , and was introduced to detective-inspector japp , who in his turn introduced us both to his companion , superintendent summerhaye .
i mean imagination ?
' ' something has happened to please her ?
i am very glad of that .
hes deadlet me see , who was his junior ?
you think thats odd , i suppose , said mr .
what about massage ?
what did miss williams seeshe saw caroline crale very carefully and anxiously wiping off fingerprints and subsequently imposing her dead husbands fingerprints on the beer bottle .
people ringing up .
he spelt it out for her .
wonder who wrote it ?
he rubbed his hands .
madame exe is late , she murmured .
yes , shed had an afternoon offand he , rowley , had wasted over an hour of valuable time !
sooner or later he had got to reenter the civilized zone .
more groans from me .
we havent checked his statement , remember , said tommy .
i am most terribly sorry .
put it on , sir , a moment .
i have a car waiting outside now to take me there what is it you want to see ?
patrick and julia simmons are the right age , but their background seems clear enough .
so you think hes all right ?
but i was not a girl in a thousand ; i was just a girl who had found out the truth about herself and was rather ashamed about it .
to frighten her ?
and a very capable one .
yes , yes , old man , but look at it like this .
there are many aspects of the horse .
then i open a drawer of the desk , take out the pistol which i keep there , load it , if it is not loaded , and thendo i proceed to shoot myself ?
margharita , you know , had an extraordinary effect on men .
radiators in every bedroom .
i asked him various routine questions , but his manner was very uncertain and his replies were somewhat vague in character .
quite extraordinary , said curry .
i cant wait .
both ladies looked at poirot in rapt and delighted surprise .
anything special the matter ?
your nephew had no enemies that you know of ?
he was hot from walking fast .
his secretary entered the roomshe advanced towards his desk , as he looked up .
you see , i am martine dubois .
will they want something ?
he told me , for instance , that he had been convinced his wife was administering drugs to him .
i have come , said hercule poirot , to admit an error .
haydock said dubiously : could almost take the car up .
do you think its a dead rabbit or something ?
no , its a large cocktailsuitable for a triumphant mccarty .
he was quite decent in his way , said griselda grudgingly .
a wild spanish revolution dance .
he shifted his pipe a little , and replied without removing his gaze from the horizon : mon desir belongs to his lordship , lord edward campion , everyone knows that .
only later did he see the horse galloping alone .
lily looked at him swiftly , her lips trembled a little .
together she and jimmy reached the car , loraine behind them .
restarick groaned and buried his face in his hands .
he said : wed better come to a clear understanding .
parker pynes office to read , not for the first time , the advertisement from the morning paper which had brought him there .
but i am humiliated to have to say that my impressions are valueless .
tanios laugheda rich rollicking laugh .
he was telephoning , i believe .
his evidence at the inquest resulted in a verdict of misadventure .
is there any message you want me to give him if i succeed ?
boris shook his head doubtfully .
with a sweep of her arm , she smashed the window with the heavy telephone set , and before father could get to his feet , she was out of the window and edging her way rapidly along the narrow parapet .
poirot , suffered a great hurt mentally at his most susceptible age .
sixteen second month of summer _num_ th day imhotep sat huddled down upon himself .
not satisfied , i mean , that david hunter did it .
thomas roydes was untidy , with clothes lying about .
he had been annoyed , very annoyed , when trotter had arranged for her to play .
dyou know , she said , that lance told me to stick as close to you as i could .
no arsenic to obtain and administernothing definitejustnegation !
you know , the other day when the ac was speaking to me of these murders , something that he said seemed to me to be wrong .
why , twouldnt have took ee tu minutes to be off with them boots .
when theyve drunk too much theyre not a bit refined anymorea girl never knows what unpleasantness she may be let in for .
about time , too !
her parents were decent folk , too , who had brought her up very strictly .
my mother and my grandmother never approved of reading anything like a novel in the mornings .
you will ask forlet me seeten thousand pounds .
i feel really terribly ashamed .
cleverer than you or i have been so far .
why , as likely as not , you actually disturbed him at work .
vivien lee was at bournemouth .
go ahead , dolly .
naturally you do not .
it rather looks as though the man were hanging round the place deliberately .
do stop making housewifely objections , polly .
youre hurt !
and there is nothing to show , is there , that they did not , subsequently , come back to this country ?
she is very tiresome .
this was indeed a withdrawing room .
youre late back , miss webb .
it was in dinard that i first took to theatrical life .
he cross-questioned me rather sharply over the details of our conversation and i could read between the lines that he was not best pleased to have been absent .
the smell in the kitchen is too frightful .
and as i and my wife left the next day , people gossiped and said shed gone away with me .
not underneath .
he had done a little unpacking last night and what little he had done had been of a cursory nature .
reassured on this point she went on : but this has been a very bad shock to me and mr .
and she had been justified in her audacity .
finally , between them , they managed it .
i must on no account be moved for two or three days .
teach her not to go round loosing off toy firearms , said tim unfeelingly as he helped himself to butter .
it was that without doubt ?
yesbrought back by great-great-great-uncle timothy from his travels .
her voice changed and softened as she pronounced the name .
occur ?
after all , it looked very like natural death , possibly as the result of a wasp sting ; there was a wasp , remember not likely to forget that wasp , put in japp .
but , then , i have some evidence .
then he added sharply : and the wine was definitely poisoned ?
as i passed him , i sniffed dubiously .
issued by her majestys secretary of state for foreign affairs , god bless his trusting heart .
are you going to tell japp all this ?
its odd that you should think of that , he said .
well , im dashed !
the doctor grunted .
i know , i tell you .
there was an assurancea slickness about the crime .
i went to his concert at the albert hall , said mr .
both of you must be very careful .
i know where you did go .
it might be anything , i expect , said tommy .
rendell was nervousbut then shes a nervous type , you cant go by that .
and once again , more clearly than ever , i saw the death of sir bartholomew strange as the original and purposeful murder .
the dominions have got to be alerted , to stand on their toes and to co-operate in the whole thing .
about that letter , there was , i thought , the odour of the fish .
on the stage .
parkinson ?
she sits up there and never goes out , and broods about sin .
she wondered a little about anthea .
and your left hand is what you are born with and the right hand is what you make of your life .
it sounds japanese , said tuppence doubtfully .
you yourself did not go into the adjoining compartment ?
she said , bingo did it you see , sir arthur , said marriot .
she was dead , im sure of it .
something in her tone struck me and i glanced at her curiously .
im afraid your watch isnt done quite as soon as this , miss elvira , said mr .
they went over the passwords again .
it seems such a funny thing for a child to want to do .
i think youre right , dora , said miss blacklock .
i didnt mind being poor with you , but when i was alone i hadnt the nerve to stand up against the sordidness of it all .
i want herto be happy .
goby sat down with his hands on his knees , and gazed earnestly at the radiator .
at my second meeting with carlotta adams i broached the idea .
david swung round on him .
paul varesco !
there was someonebut would he , she wondered , be any good ?
of course she used to hint things sometimes .
not until they were hoarse did they stop .
of course you may say it is all an old maids fancyjust imagination .
the doctor had had the air of one keeping his temper in leash and who has had some experience of being called out unnecessarily on more than one occasion .
pretending to be so great and so wonderful , and to know all about everything .
its a straightforward story .
he shot himself in the foot , you remember , after very severe fighting at arras .
i get worse every day , he muttered dejectedly .
it might be you , he added , unrolling a second chocolate bar .
arden shook his head solemnly .
does that really seem to you a credible suggestion , mr .
inglethorp was shielding her stepson .
now then , giuseppe , lets hear whether anything more has occurred to you about this .
there seemed to be some sort of commotion .
hawaii !
i suppose thats the sort of thing which might come in useful .
rogers room , as philip lombard had already ascertained , was untenanted .
youre in my digs .
graves said a middle-aged spinster .
i recognized suddenly that his movements were absolutely silent , his feet made no sound as they trod .
she did not come to see you here , at your house ?
well , i was employed in trying to find the firm jack renauld employed to convert his souvenirs .
he hasnt got our disgusting minds !
none of us liked her husband and she was offended about it , and so the estrangement grew .
i told her of what i had decided .
he was a clever crook but he wasnt a murderer .
apparently he didnt even get undressed last night .
poirot nodded and seemed to lose interest .
chapter _num_ hmm .
there always are secret papers .
craddock speaking .
she said the last time shed seen it was on the shelf in our bathroom .
but all the same , he said to himself as he went down the stairs , all the same , it is a link .
and all the neighbours knowing .
death very simple - a fall down the stairs .
in these imaginings there is never a happy ending .
i said : he is in trouble ?
the funny thing is , he added , that ive got a feeling theres something fishy somewhere .
miss peake appeared at the french windows , carrying a large garden-fork .
her voice rose hysterically .
he was staring intently at the frenchman , and absentmindedly fingers played with a box of matches .
you say that this miss milrays mother lives at gilling and is an invalid .
youve nothing to do with any of us .
i didnt mean his head dropped .
surely it cant be connected with the poor doctors death in any way ?
shaw came and said shed taken a nasty sprain but that shed be able to get about again all right in perhaps a week .
a beautiful house , beautiful grounds .
and then his housekeeper rang up .
still , they may have left something behind them that will be a clue .
youd better go .
but usually they are quite understandable though distressing .
i think it most unlikely , said dr .
but in all probability the girl will have entirely forgotten the intervening period , and will take up life where she left offat the sinking of the lusitania .
i thought that was quite enough for him .
poirot went on : so you might as well come back and sit down and give me the answer to the question i asked you just now .
you tried to withdraw and you were faced with a threat .
hes box office , darling !
but he was not satisfied with that explanation .
weve only just got back , aunt marcia .
and shed find me there with a dead bodya girls dead bodyand shed think id killed her .
after that , well go out to the abbey and see what we can discover on the spot .
off you go .
have you shaken her ?
two men were to go to the address he gave , and , in general terms , were to watch over the safety of miss monro .
henry horsham for one , perhaps .
hes got something on his mind , thought mr .
do you think you would recognize him if you saw him ?
it was someone who was already here , waiting .
where were you going ?
because she wanted it .
but they behaved very wellyes , very well .
brewster was away .
im of the same opinion as you , regarding that , cadwallader replied .
no doubt about it , miracles happen .
but he wasnt that kind of man .
why , but for you , i should be urging doctors to shut me up in a loony bin .
the cause of the accident was supposed to be the ball of the little bob , was it not ?
leidner lying here resting , peaceful and unsuspicious .
it takes more than dancing class to make a dancer , i said .
her solitary achievement in that line had been the handsome and well-gaitered bishop of westchester whom she had addressed affectionately as dear robbie and who had responded with equal affection and with memories of himself as a child in a hampshire vicarage calling out lustily be a crocodile now , aunty janie .
well , what can i do for you ?
as you heard at the inquest , the womans death according to the police surgeons evidence must have occurred about three to four weeks ago .
darn it all , man , roared gregory rolf , leaning forward , do you notice it now ?
well , youre better at it than i am , i said .
the only unpleasant thing that ever happened to rosemary was having an attack of flu !
its merit if i remember rightly , was that it didnt go out in a wind .
leverson committed the crime ?
rafiel had thought that his own point of view might be wrong .
poirot , it isntit isnt strychnine , is it ?
poirot looked horrified at the idea .
_num_ th september .
and then you came , said elvira to father .
on this particular evening mrs .
miss bowers looked her usual composed , unhurried self .
in fact , you ought to have a regular band of gunmen to protect you !
i came to meet you , said the child .
this name stuck in mine because i linked it up with a silly nursery rhyme they used to sing to me when i was a kid .
mrs oglanders other daughter may be dead to her family , but the world knows her as valerie saintclair !
the coroner had done his bestowen griffith also , but afterwards , jammed in the crowd of eager village women , i heard the same hateful sibilant whisper i had begun to know so well , no smoke without fire , thats what i say !
the wind is quite strong and there are white horses on the sea .
after all , it would be easy , wouldnt it , to come along with a plausible tale of having been a friend of mrs .
you were about to say ?
jan retorted swiftly .
there was something strange about it , something inspiringand uplifting .
fournier spoke with irritable sarcasm .
they were silent , reliving a childish memory .
longer , if you had to stop and think here and there .
after all , we really know very little about the man .
i have done everything i wanted to , and nothing that i did not want to do .
or had he just been soothing her down ?
he wanted to know all about him and his wife and when they came thereall sorts of things .
what will she say , i wonder ?
i passed sentence on a rightly convicted murderer .
your father ?
now four people were on the scene before the police arrived .
persecution mania very acute .
he tested the edge in a rather nasty waya kind of sthetic pleasure about that that i didnt care about .
i came round this morning , i said , because ive a suggestion to make .
i have nothing to do with them .
you say that if people arentarent happytoto come to you .
quite like the movies , eh , mrs hailsham-brown ?
sitting on a low divan was a figure at whom she stared with complete incredulity .
i know ram lal .
two bokharas and three or four really good persian ones , including a hamadan and a tabriz .
but what has all this got to do with youor with miss springer ?
yes , yes , i think that was the day i remember it quite well .
i tried not to show in any way that my marriage hadnt been a success .
policewoman alice jones was an accomplished swimmer .
your spies were right , she said , with a laugh .
rather odd that there are absolutely no personal papers , letters , etc .
i shall have everybody sitting round , and then ill go over it allwith the clues , and then i shall say , quite suddenly : and it was you she thrust out a dramatic forefinger just as edith de haviland entered the room .
the two men fell in beside her .
signit is your best chance .
at that point , poirot nudged me gently , indicating two men who were sitting together near the door .
he was sweet on her .
that seems to me proved .
we have had frauds before , gigantic frauds and there is money now circulating around .
this was in the autumn of _num_ .
you did not see him later to bid him good night ?
thank you , madame , he said , taking the passport from her .
rafiel would not have liked it , but miss marple didnt think mr .
he walked home with me .
did he doze off at all ?
dont be too disconsolate , miss tuppence , he said in a low voice .
thats why weve found it fairly plain sailing .
twenty-four edward angkatell stood hesitantly in the swirl of foot traffic in shaftesbury avenue .
they seem quite happy .
certain chapters , therefore , are written in the third person .
someone who might turn up anywhere and who , if he did turn up , was always an announcement that something was going to happen .
leave it to vera .
i liked him so much all along and thought he would make such a nice husband for you .
who do you think likely to have killed lord edgware ?
its been a republic ever sincebut things still manage to be pretty lively there , so ive heard .
bateman severely .
the balloons gone up , he said .
she said : after all , edward , you and i have known henrietta all our lives .
run about all day , dont you ?
she looked across at him .
well , what is it , pat ?
bundle was looking very thoughtful .
, on shelves , and a small refrigerator which was filled with ice every morning and in which some beer and ginger beer was always kept .
for that was the idea behind the fanatical young , the idea was greater than the idea that they had started out with .
they lacked subtlety and as life went on he had become increasingly fond of subtleties .
what about moira ?
he cannot accept a straightforward solution without pretending that it squares with his preconceived ideas .
too late , mr .
youve been most kind .
i hold a medical degree , of course , but i practice purely as a psychiatrist .
it is my weakness , it has always been my weakness , to desire to show off .
thats it , isnt it ?
it will have now to be washed and neverneverdo i wash my omelette pan .
poirot watched me as i read .
oh , blameit is not blameit is publicity !
and soif you cant talk about how you did it , you can at least talk about the murder itselfdiscuss it , advance theoriesgo over it .
old sins cast long shadows .
all wrong for the nursery rhymethats very significant , isnt it ?
i never know what money i shall have next yearand anyone who is looking after my income tax is always arguing over problems arising several years previously , which have not yet been agreed .
despair seized victoria .
he had noticed affinities , antagonism , the unguarded words that arose as always when property was to be divided .
thats the way , he thought , that the poor child defends herself .
yes terrible terrible .
andy peters looked down on her consideringly .
the majority of patients in the out-patient department at university college hospital , where i worked in _num_ , were particular as to the exact colour and taste of their preparations .
it is helpful , said poirot .
only old janet .
trefusis came down the stairs again .
because i dont know who he is or where to look for him .
then , with a bow , he handed it back to the superintendent .
how astute is my friend hastings , he declared , taking the case from him .
kilterbury ring was a local beauty spot though its remains were not particularly famous .
it was after about half an hour of tramping muddy lanes that i finally turned in at the gates of the vicarage , and made my way up a singularly ill-kept drive , to pull a rusty looking bell at the side of the front door .
raynor smiled politely .
do you remember , mademoiselle ?
i said to anyone ?
fettered and bound by personal and emotional relationships .
farr and harry began to batter on the door .
do gentle creatures commit murder ?
the dark buildings on either side of the passageway shut out the sunlight and left it dark and mysterious .
that guest , m .
nobody thinks of my feelings , she sobbed .
it wouldnt be a racing motorist called ladislaus malinowski ?
he had been mixed up in a forgery case before .
he has had more than enough excitement today .
i honestly cannot tell you , monsieur .
craddock urged .
folliat , nobody with hatties mentality could be relied upon to keep silence .
there was a little ball of crumpled paper on the floor where it must have fallen out of a pocket .
might give valuable information .
and the printed pages from which the letters were cut were found where shed hidden them in her house .
it seemed a fantastic place to choose as the rendezvous of a gang of criminals .
she got up abruptly .
lloyd george at different music halls , or impersonating old men with beards in repertory plays .
that , said poirot , slightly embarrassed ; a bagatelle , mademoiselle .
that is what i say !
will you listen to me ?
put a call through and found maude had left that morning .
milor , i am glad to have met you .
theres only one person who fits the bill , and wait , giles , wait molly broke in .
thatsh remarkable fac .
i had not much hope of success , and i did not get it .
fash-fashionmedical fashion today .
poirot said slowly : you knowi am not sure that i have not done just exactly that .
he came across the room and sat down on the arm of one of the massive , upholstered chairs .
i say , said the newcomer .
just tell me what i want to know .
convince yourself as soon as may be of our innocence in this terrible business .
he came back to england when he heard the news , and , as to the bended knees , that was a figure of speech , his secretary , mr .
when she really hits her stride , as she does here , agatha christie is hard to surpass .
why are we all being kept here in this way ?
heaps better than i thought shed be .
as for the other mrs .
he liked modern furniture .
have you ever heard the name selma goetz before ?
however , i surmise that the fifth sign represented what is familiarly known as telepathythe opening of mind to mind .
the next thing , i think , said race , is whether anyone heard anything which might give a clue as to the time of the crime .
come here quickly .
how did rosemary and farradays wife get on ?
she was writing on it before she went out .
nofret laughed .
he doesnt sound a very attractive character , i said .
i think there are people who could tell you if they were willing to tell you .
oh , father !
the inspector was talking on the telephone , and constable jones continued to stand guard .
it will be like a party ?
i am too poor .
not however much i wanted to .
and used he to threaten elvira ?
it is necessary for her to undergo a very serious operation .
she could only stare helplessly at george .
hed immediately get another secretarywhich he did .
only one , in fact , does not , major blunt .
ive got keys to all the doors in this house , so that was no problem .
she counted on his not suspectingsimply because it was so soon .
picked out his photograph from among five others .
what have you learnt ?
i flatter myself that i have carried it through very well so far , said tommy with some complacence .
the doctor knelt down by the dead man , and giraud turned to the examining magistrate .
i shant let you down .
no use crying over spilt milk , you know .
will you trust me and come to me ?
yes , theyre here now .
a doctor knows secrets , my friend , important secrets .
royde shrugged his shoulders .
otherwise its a pretty fair hell for a brilliant man who isnt brilliant any more .
oh , she was nice , said tuppence .
if you knew poirot leaned forward .
but i catch the idea .
the atmosphere of this room was quite different from the rest of the house .
and after the dreamthe awakening .
i keep these two test tubes to safeguard charlotte now and in the future .
noneunless hate arising out of some incident unknown .
her eyes widened and darkened .
did celia austin have coffee ?
this has been a most rotten business .
there was no time for more , for at that minute , as poirot had prophesied , blunt left the others in his abrupt fashion and came over to us .
in his pleasant voice , edward said : no , distinctly chilly .
it was just after tea that the bentley purred up the drive of merroway court , a stiff and correct chauffeur at the wheel .
and i , hercule poirot , am not satisfied about the verdict in the mcginty case .
i do know elvira was terribly worried about something and afraid .
i saw flora ackroyd this morning , said miss gannett .
that was different , starkwedder replied quickly .
it is absolutely safe , she thinks , to take the pistol from its hiding place and put it in madames coat .
everything was all right , there wasnt any question of that miss olga getting away with the money , so i didnt see as it was any call for me but now you feel differently ?
she made a quick warning gesture .
vera said almost in a whisper : you thinkthat was what was meant ?
it was a few days before mrs .
only anarchy can benefit those who march behind it .
oh , and what is that ?
and especially to florence .
if ever a house could have been called the laurels , this one could , remarked colin lamb .
it seems extraordinary that i should well , want to talk to you about it .
but why , asked another voice , hadnt he sent her a word of reassurance ?
yes , captain marshall , your own movements this morning , please .
who were they , do you remember ?
but there , im wandering from the point again .
the train to paris leaves at _num_ : _num_ , he observed .
an agonised yelp of protest burst from tommy , but too late .
i write with perfect politeness , tender my regrets , my apologies , explain that i am completely desolatedbut what will you ?
after all , i am not giving a party !
the comtes foot pressed hard on the accelerator .
all the same !
going to come on to rain soon , it is , and rain hard , too .
i think she was feeling the heat .
because , my friend , if , as i say , my little idea is correctanne morisot is in imminent danger .
to this i did not respond .
you are far away from all you knowyou are alonecan i not help ?
you can leave angela out of it , said sir charles .
seora de caspearo opened her eyes and murmured : how ugly are old men !
i cant really tell now .
no , no , poirot , dont go over it all again !
he works himself into such curious states .
oh , yes , im positive .
people ought to be forced to make wills !
i will give you _num_ whatever you want .
youve examined the note for fingerprints , of course , said the chief constable .
hercule poirot rubbed his nose .
yours truly , john robinson .
miss lytton gore and i are going to get married .
how impossible it seems for a man to get any peace .
the superintendent pushed past him and ran up the stairs .
not that i had any doubts as to the outcome .
hes in the city all day .
yesyes , now you come to speak of it i think he did limp .
there will be six clues .
for me , writing was fun .
he certainly had no suspicions .
i confess that if mrs .
janet is a splendid girland the queer thing is that she really adores that week-kneed young man .
he was far more afraid of tuppence damaging herself than he was of doing the damage to himself .
finally , with a gracious inclination of the head , she said , i am very much obliged to you , monsieur poirot .
inglethorp arrested now ?
he thinks hes going to have my fingers fiddling about his pie .
isnt it , sir ?
ive always been terribly fond of you , she said .
in this case mr p .
the man who brings the letter tomorrow might be followed .
lord ?
but to business , m .
and as im telling you , i cant get in .
_num_ of famous houses and gardens .
asked frankie puzzled .
vienna steaks indeed !
he turned to the left and marched along at a good pace without once turning his head .
asked battle shrewdly .
i dont know how you expect anyone to look who has a dead child , said tommy .
see , it is my most cherished possession .
moira got up abruptly .
he shivered slightly at the aspect of dovecotes .
the one that giggled most was (he thought) called helenand there was another called nancyand the third one was , for some reason , addressed as socks .
at least it seems to me unlikely that your mother would sit down at a table and let that person pick up a poker and hit her on the back of the head .
church .
i think its very unlikely .
to be sure , there was an excuse .
further triumphs ?
why should i want to kill a monsieur whom i have never seen before ?
the tenth , and more discerning , would have hesitated , puzzled by something indefinable that did not ring true .
nemesis was first published in _num_ .
i forgot to ask her .
ma foi , i think they are an interesting lot !
people dont like feeling sorry or feeling anything is their fault .
i came over with superintendent parwell from matchfield .
it is odd , that !
youre not a trouble , darling .
he said with a laugh : damned funny , meadowes .
it was a fair-sized church and she thought that the village of sutton chancellor must once have been a rather more important centre of rural life than it was now .
i thought shed go up in smoke .
entwhistle , sidetracked the aunt .
for once both lady westholme and miss pierce seemed a little at a loss .
where was it ?
he said : it is of no importance .
ah , signor , it is you .
the other three had whiskyopening a fresh bottle and using a siphon from a nailed up case .
in savage tribes theyd probably have killed and eaten her years ago !
i should say so most assuredly .
inglethorp did take it , he has had ample time to replace it by now .
then that was whohe was ?
and sosooner or laterdisaster .
she was speaking with obvious self-restraint but her hands were trembling .
said colin faintly .
he brought down his fist on the table .
the circumstances were peculiar .
but the puzzle is still there , it seems .
that letter will have to be read at the inquest .
i think youve given him too much , tommy , said tuppence innocently .
she was done for !
a mysterious countryafrica .
she has pretty manners , pretty ways .
oh , whats dinner !
but after listening to a rotten one like juliuss , im inclined to let you off .
that would break the spell .
do you really wish to rake up the whole thing ?
battle said bluntly : whats your idea of the right line to take , m .
i interviewed his secretary , and it was apparent at once that everything was clear and aboveboard .
she looked at no one .
theyre slow , these cases , but theyre pretty sure .
the castle crumbled .
to put the clock back a few yearsa very few , i am sureand re-enter one of those charming pensionnats de jeunes filles with which paris abounds tuppence interrupted him .
but whats wanted is a lot more research out there on the spot .
so might the damned look up and see paradise he said again : you it did something to herthat low , vibrant tone .
ferrars than the doctor who was attending him ?
yes , but she neednt let that worry her , said hardcastle .
i admit that it was very hard on jackie , and im very sorry about itbut there it is .
the introduction of a totally unexpected eileen brandon startled me .
i think she actually enjoyed it .
her cheeks were just a little pinkand her eyes wide and excited .
i can only describe it as a kind of perverted voice .
ive already realized that .
wellif you want to fix it nearer home , id say your best bet was alex restarick .
she relapsed again into her dream .
you have unique opportunities , said the other , with a note of envy in his voice .
it wasnt the man , was it , who came last week and asked us if we had any antiques to dispose of ?
i shall always see herfunny thing , romance .
not just kk .
if anyone tried to make me say id done something i hadnt id feel more like giving them a sock on the jaw .
they all seem to say the same things , whether they steal from a supermarket or take away a baby .
it was a good long time ago .
) sir samuel said menacingly : i put it to you that you deliberately planned to put this girl out of the way , in the hope that roderick welman would return to you .
finally , he poured a few drops of the cocoa into a test tube , sealing it up carefully .
he ate very little and hardly seemed to notice what was on his plate .

slightly out of breath , she came to a halt outside the ground glass door with the legend painted across it : esthonia glassware co .
he seems incapable of putting up any sort of defence .
its the fancy dress dance .
i think , said melchett , wed better see mr .
i didnt mean , sir , i didnt mean toto do anything what i shouldnt do .
the coloured print dress she wore fell nearly to her ankles .
perhaps she had accomplished her purpose .
somebody is dead ?
i dont know , said elvira .
paddington had been even more crowded than on the preceding fridayas there were now only two days to go before christmas , but the _num_ : _num_ was comparatively peacefulat any rate , in the rear portion .
thats the way life is .
you know her christian name ?
drains , i think !
your guide would tap on it , go in leaving you standing outside , to return presently , beaming all over his face and showing himself delighted that you had passed the test successfully .
wasteful and extravagant .
the most noticeable feature about her was her clear china-blue eyes .
ronnie retreated with an apology and presently presented himself at the front door .
flora wrinkled her brows a minute .
it cannot be surely it cannot be that i am mistaken ?
he turned away abruptly .
llewellyn-smythe to know that id been poking about in her things .
as colonel melrose had hinted , there was something un-english about himthe easy grace of his movements , the dark , handsome face , the eyes set a little too near together .
i have never liked imhotep .
no , i am wrong .
i had a lengthy conversation with father lavigny .
protheroe has only been in my study once since the murder , and then she was wearing black and so would not have been likely to have had on a blue earring .
unfortunately , said tommy , we have to return to town .
it does not make the sense , that !
kettering , he said .
the superintendent looked wooden again .
emma looked up at him .
oh , general practice is a good beginning .
it isandyesyoure mark easterbrook !
quite easy to add arsenic to a bottle of tonicquite easy to add a few lines to a typewritten letter .
well , that is all i have to say .
he could get nothing out of her but that .
weve reserved no .
made of much ornamented brass , it was shaped like an adze , heavy , with a sharp cutting edge .
miss packard is so efficient always .
not a very pleasant subject .
twenty hercule poirot looked up at the faade of the dignified georgian house in what had been until recently a quiet street in an old-fashioned market town .
but , all the same , im afraid hes going to be disappointed .
dr bryant confirmed the stewards fear that the woman was dead .
best not to think .
i hate chelsea , she protested .
he had been intimate with but two of the other passengers one a broken-down european named dyer who appeared to bear a somewhat unsavoury reputation , the other a young bank clerk named charles lester , who was returning from hong kong .
' you are too tamable , mademotselle .
two nights ago i understand there was a scare of burglary .
the police what on earth have i to do with the police ?
in a car ?
cunningham .
besides purchasing expensive but delicious sheetsshe loved linen sheets with their texture and their coolnessshe also indulged in a purchase of good quality red-bordered glass cloths .
five pound note , no less !
she found it difficult to pass the time .
she went to the mirror over the fireplace and applied a small powder puff to her face .
bit of a nuisance and all that , you know .
one should always start an investigation with the simplest and most obvious theories .
christine said : then i dont know what she wanted them for .
katherine shuddered , and he turned at once to her kindly .
but he was generous with his money .
i dont suppose as it matters mentioning it to you , sir .
thats the idea is it ?
i know i am .
he said at last quietly : whats wrong , audrey ?
said hay .
they had no alternative , mademoiselle , after the verdict .
i dont think she was really responsible for what she was saying or doing .
think whatever theyve done is sure to be all right , no matter how things go for other people .
raymond out of it for a minute .
where was alfred inglethorp ?
mother and monty had never really got on together harmoniously .
ii havent got it on me , he declared .
ah , but he had no opportunity .
poppy looked as concerned as it was possible for her to look , which was not very much .
while he was doing this , the admiral and i strolled up and down the terrace , smoking cigars and enjoying the warm june air .
you are sure that in connection with this girl there have been no deaths ?
la chambre de domestique .
hugo trent casually remarked to me , that amidst all the vapouring there is an occasional shrewd thrust .
harrison stared at him .
i dont know what he had to build upon .
you dont quite take my meaning , mr .
his voice was provocative in mr .
that list is your secret property .
you see that , do you not ?
go somewhere and ask questions ?
well , after her acquittal , ken married her .
roberts overcalled but though he went down badly once or twice , his calling paid , for more than once he frightened miss meredith out of bidding her hand .
he turned to stephen farraday : by the way , mr .
ive got an answer for you .
lord kidderminster was speaking , directing with a good deal of ability the trend of the interview .
give yourself another day or two , i said .
then why try to hush it up , to have it labelled and put aside as suicide ?
a child of a neighbour was attacked .
you understand , monsieur , said poirot , that in view of what has occurred i am obliged to put certain questions to all the passengers .
eight , then .
changeschanges everywhere .
you asked me about julia carting-ton .
the next thing i knew he was worrying about an extra cabin .
i hadnt thought of that , she said simply .
suddenly , at these words , he wheeled round .
they mounted and rode away down the castle drive .
that wife of his was lucky .
oliver offered them the piece of paper , but they waved it away .
it was a trainthen below her was the railway line and on it a goods train uttering cries of distress as it puffed along .
miss bunner loved her friends possessions with as much fervour as though they had been her own .
but chantry is a mulish sort of devil .
the colour began to come back into her cheeks .
before the door closed molly heard mr .
tucker , wisps of hair hanging over her somewhat hot face , came to the door .
theyre both all right .
she was very kind .
bower to say that these notes onerobscure alkaloidsare kept in the desk with the other papers ?
hercule poirot , the well-known investigator , but this was the first time she had seen him in the flesh .
why does she go on lying there ?
in fact i shall have to .
hercule poirot was talking .
we dont know what name he is travelling under , we dont know when he will arrive .
i am afraid of felicie .
the inconspicuous mr simpson .
have you any evidence as to when this man last had a meal ?
madame could not deceive a newborn babe if she tried .
let me speak to madame amory first .
she added , i felt something evil was about .
startledand possibly frightened .
youre not olive betterton ?
did she have any special friends among the residents of the flats ?
and above all dont go starting a lot of silly rumours .
it was rumoured that mr .
you had a good view of marina gregg from where you were standing ?
coddle em , thats what they do nowadays .
how amazing !
the man was talking to guy pagett .
that miss knight .
you see , said poirot gently .
poirot put his head on one side .
' ' and then without doubt , you went to a theatre ?
a delightful evening , said mr .
ill try and find it for you .
lady marrowayfine womannot quite the goods , of course , he knew thathe was perfectly well aware that what he had called all his life the crme de la crme would have very little to do with the marrowaysbut then the crme de la crme were supremely unaware of his own existence .
craddock was rather a one for the gents .
he got into the house with no particular difficultyprobably through the front door .
then why is he staying at the three boars instead of at fernly park ?
d and then wiped his oil hand car h ' 	o , , / .
nigel led the way upstairs and along the passage to pats room .
no , that would seem too much to hope for .
he saw the terror leap into her eyes .
well , its a splendid thought , said colonel pikeaway .
why on earth didnt you tell slack this last night ?
now that richards dead , im the only man in the house .
very naughty but such fun .
i go down that way to bathe .
he said : glad to see you , poirot .
an out of door woman who cared nothing for the use of cosmetics .
oh dear , giles , think .
i think that the modern ideas of marriage and divorce are so sensible .
wellnow that i couldnt say , he wont come back till hes finished the joband you cant hurry things too much in this country .
looks like it , said wally .
id like to see dr .
the door was opened by a middle-aged womana decent woman in blackso i felt she should be described .
at ten oclock that evening a motorcyclist in cap and goggles passed through the village of staverley , and came to a halt at a deserted part of the road not far from the grange .
they came immediately after the vicar .
it will be better not to move him until the police arrive .
coronary , is that what i mean ?
satterthwaite opened his lips impulsively , then met the gentle quizzical gaze of poirots shining green eyes , and altered what he had been about to say .
golden hair has got to be the genuine article to take me in .
and , like yours , it is a true story .
in the rather crowded floorspace someone had joggled heather badcocks arm .
he let me see things .
oliver had lost three pounds and seven shillings to the other three .
i did him a little service in the pastan affair of bearer bonds .
we watch , and they know we watch all the enemy aliens in this country .
will you tell me exactly what it is that has upset you ?
he saw her hand steal to her heart , her eyelids flicker , then she said in a low , quick voice that somehow frightened him : ive heard nothing .
im counting on you .
quite a lot of money .
a girl whose consent you had to obtaina man whom you recognized by a gold tooth .
oliver truthfully .
he would be kinder in future .
a matter of two years now .
but nobody saw you leave , mr .
like a child whos got hold of somebodys secret .
i bet he would .
its very secret , you see .
the rich one .
just says its the sort of thing the wicked germans would do .
and live happily ever afterwards .
then why do you think she said so ?
about half past six , i would say , or quarter to seven .
it was most irregular not to do so .
the calculations were many and devious .
i rememberyes .
shes always saying sharp things to me .
yes , he was very popular round here .
he was only there a minute or so .
they could be classed with plum pudding on christmas day and village cricket and open fireplaces with wood fires .
always getting into mischief i was , at his age .
my daughter .
you see , it was dark when she came in here .
then , feeling suddenly uncomfortable , she went on : i just thought id pop in and ask you if by any chance you wanted a kitten , miss blacklock ?
how had she struck me ?
yes , an odd accident .
im off to town again tomorrow .
suspicion at once is divided between accident and the guilt of ah ling owing to the poison of the curry .
she came triumphantly along the deck looking for you and colonel race .
giving me the gipsys warning if you want to know .
the picture of the man that miss marple had built up for him had no resemblance to percival fortescue .
said sir rowland .
some of their legs are very wobbly , some of them rather slippery .
' ' none whatsoever .
they stand together a minute , and then they follow the path round the trees out of sight .
i suppose theyve all got their work to do , i said .
everywhere there were women dancing in the street .
all the same , ive always been interested in her .
she took no interest in his work , in his ambitions , in his career .
just what id been trying to do .
i am , he said heavily .
everybody , of course , was on the beach at this moment except those who had gone for expeditions .
weve brought him in .
sometimes they seemed to be on field tracks , at other times they drove over open country .
ive heard a good deal about her locally , you know , since you came here to live .
but rather a dear too .
ah , said dermot , and is his life less likely to be lonely in future ?
and no doubt , the inspector continued , the occurrence made some impression on you .
then he turned it off with a light laugh .
blair you wont get mrs .
in my potting shed ?
if she could simulate indignation , shock , horror , sufficiently wellmight it , just credibly , raise a doubt ?
stupidstupidstupid she rose suddenly to her feet .
the income that should have come over seemed always to be swallowed up in repairs or taxation .
over three quarters of an hour , he murmured .
how could i tell if he really believed what he was saying ?
sergeant hay couldnt find me at first .
) so as to combine investigation with the provision of household necessities , and returned by a train leaving paddington at twelve fifteen .
deadly dull morning .
the programme for that evening was a ballad concert .
i thought you must have gone out for a walk somewhere and i did so hope you wouldnt overtire yourself .
sit down if you like .
' ' tredwell ?
she replied so low that he hardly heard it .
she would forget everythingeverything .
but it wasnt at all like that really .
chandra lal and mr .
her voice was quite dry and unemotional .
one lie involves you in such a lot of liesand continuous lying is so monotonous .
my concubine whom i treated well , to whom i paid all honour , whom i buried with the proper rites , sparing no expense .
fortescue eating anything ?
now , now , said superintendent battle soothingly .
been a hot day , said norton .
he looked hopefully at poirot .
i meanwhat is backstage ?
it might certainly be the husbandrichards .
looks a bit peculiar to me .
the constable closed the hall door and resumed his place for note-taking , while the inspector indicated the chair near the bridge table .
her name was ruby keeneher professional name , that is .
you express yourself as intrigued by the inhabitants of the pale horse .
i mean , when i went to buy presents for my nephews last christmas there was nothing but science fiction and the stratosphere , and supersonic toys !
im no nearer , though , to what it all means .
they rushed me to hospital and theyve set it , and all things considered its not too uncomfortablebut there it is , im kind of helpless , and however id manage travelling , i dont know .
you would make sure that it was identified in the way you wanted .
it would be a gamble , said max .
the news from italy is very bad , he said .
then i want to ask about the pram too , you know it lost a nut again yesterday .
an attic , he thought , was an unlikely place for the fastidious julia to visit .
so far in my life , a lucky double had been my highest knowledge of affluence .
it sounds as though somethings happening .
she opened them as she and phillipa sat down at the tea table .
but what has happened ?
hugo sat at the bridge table .
poirot sat down and miss lemon placed before him the mornings mail , neatly arranged in categories .
drive , drive , drive , from morning to night .
there was a loaf of bread , two pots of jam , and some cheap and unwholesome-looking cakes .
tommy closed the notebook with a brisk snap .
oh , well , said ronnie , i dont believe in being strenuous myself .
if she remembered that unimportant little scar as an afterthought , it would carry conviction and clinch the identification .
well , there dear , i think youre wrong , said mrs lacey .
i thought it must be a mistake .
he seemed ill at ease .
his voice sounded apologetic .
bouc advanced as an argument in favour of it the loud cry which awoke me from sleep .
i am going to send you awayyes , it is better so .
alix smiled reflectively , and added simply , i make very good coffee .
did you come down by train ?
i suppose it was rather rotten from his point of view .
lady tadminsters sister , you know .
his visitor was a girl of perhaps twenty-odd .
lombard looked at her .
just for a moment i fancied a flicker of some quite different expression showed itself in miss lawsons dull , pale blue eyes .
we started with old palgrave , deceased , and his eternal stories .
you cant tell me , said lady tressilian , that this is neviles own idea !
i think she saw something or heard something thats given her some idea about the whole thing .
her husband looked at her sharply , but her expression was devoid of sarcasm .
a very beautiful young lady , and well thought of , for all she was a canadian and a stranger .
of these people were also present .
theyve nothing to say either , because theres no such thing .
it is not the mere act of killing , it is what lies behind it that appeals to the expert .
a good party , i think , but milly jean always gives good parties .
either she would or she wouldnt .
harrys voice recalled me to myself .
ill confess , im curious myself .
he found himself reluctantly believing her .
_num_ , which is not engaged .
are you staying here by any chance ?
it looked for a moment as though he might fling himself on hercule poirot , but finally he turned away .
i guess hes quite capable of running revolutions in three countries at once if he chose !
its possible , she said at last .
as a matter of fact , he remarked in a dry professional manner , it is a case of dual personality that takes me to newcastle tonight .
she lifted her voice and called me names .
there was no further letter or news of any kind .
she never needed roderick welman .
no , mademoiselle , it was false .
the usual trouble , i suppose .
and as it is not plain to meeh bienthen the missing factor is the keystone of the mystery !
of what you found in a tennis racquet in the dead of night .
its not so easy to get a good male nurse attendant .
shes out of his reach .
it was this doorim plumb certain of it .
	eyem-g him with some disfavour , , a .
yes , sir , he asserted , thats the gentleman who came in at half past ten and asked for mr .
it has saved me from many embarrassments .
we dont say that sort of thing much nowadays , sir .
she walked briskly towards the house .
now , mrs harmon , what we want to know is , where is the suitcase that walter st john actually deposited at paddington station ?
and suddenly a tide of bitterness rose in her .
she was by now entering into the spirit of the thing .
irritating whiney repetition .
figures always go with buried treasure .
she was certainly not shooting deer with a a peer in scotland , and it seemed equally unlikely that she was on the sun deck of a liner cruising round the world .
' it is to me a little reminder , hastings .
thats what he wantspublicitynotoriety .
if anything put him in a bad temper he was so impossible that one loathed him with a virulent hatred .
japp looked up as poirot entered .
this is a rich show , supported , asked for , demanded perhaps by youth and provided by by whom ?
but i did see that living in the country was like a new game to my attractive sister .
and whats more he never will be sure .
it wasdamn it allit was detached .
they were also , incidentally , of the right age to be in the forefront of suspects in the mind of inspector raglan and , it seemed , in the view of an elderly gardener .
he kept two cars , you know , and marsdon manor is a pretty big place to keep up , although i believe he bought it very cheap .
i was forced to the conclusion that mrs .
the expedition house was not actually very far from hassanieh , but it was a lonely spot and dr .
against the wall was a bookcase with books .
they alter the clocks .
its our turn next .
personally , i think you have .
complete nonsense and waste of time .
the lake !
oh , i dont think it could have been .
he turned away from her and went to meet sugden .
she kept the conversation going without effort .
we retraced our steps over our former route , passing the grave again , and making a detour on to the road .
i thought myself wed see emmott first , then sandford , and then we can go on and see ellis .
sir bartholomew continued to apply ruthless common sense to sir charless unformulated suspicions .
its one of us .
on entering , he did not , as the others had expected , enter the sitting-room .
i havent been able to design anything for weeks .
and i pulled the curtainsone of the rings caught , sir , and i had to jerk it hard .
probably because she was a proud masterful sort of womanoutstandingly so , i should say .
her hand was on her beating heart .
her name was mrs .
really , battle , interposed george , shocked to the core .
stand there looking east .
thought youd come by this train if you werent out when my wire arrived .
it wasnt you , mrer major blunt , i said .
and yeti can hardly picture sandford committing any violent action .
lancaster would like the picture returned to her .
someone has telephoned , you say ?
regrettably , of course , edward would think so , too !
the time was notpropitious .
_num_ in storyteller , may _num_ .
i think there was something edmundson spoke cautiously and with reluctance .
she had never been able to understand why a doctor , who spent his time treating the ailments of others , could be so indifferent to the health of his own family .
orheres a very good ideaand not so much done in booksshe pretends they are stolen , gets in an awful state and he gives her a fresh lot .
that was childishly simple , thoughmerely a question of adding a nought .
i mean that he had nothing to do with it .
derek damned money and the power of money vehemently to himself .
what was his christian name ?
no , not that one , said bobby .
inspector raglan stared , but i was quicker .
but i am not in the least satisfied .
she put a large motherly arm round emilys shoulders and patted her consolingly .
i never dreamt poirot interrupted .
finally he slipped the chequebook into his pocket and left the flat .
eversleigh come by the same train .
but thinking it over afterwards i decided that there had definitely been something .
he had employed a young modern architect and given him a free hand .
roberts kissed it .
not too late to make a visit .
what do you mean by word coming from her ?
he turned to miss brewster .
possibly by some quite different womanpossibly by an amah or a servant .
the door was opened to us by the handsome butler .
superintendent battle , she called imperiously .
i do wish he was here , anne , she gulped .
theyd all got loads of money .
i dont know , though , if theres anywhere to stay up there .
who plants the damned things ?
thats our business .
he has immense strength in his arms and shoulders .
i thoughti thought id have the laugh of them .
roderick youre meaning ?
i suppose the robbery took place after that ?
then if boris comes , you could make some kind of signal , and id trail him .
the next minute he stepped back with a little exclamation of dismay .
ta-ta-ta !
when i do get time for reading , which isnt very often , i prefer an improving book .
goby lowered his eyes and quoted from his notebook : ill tell you , i found something , i did !
my only reaction was a yearning to throw her into a hot bath , give her a cake of soap and urge her to get on with it !
he was just holding one up , admiring it like , and i happened to mention that mr .
ive warned her , i said , many times and now my words have come true .
no , no , indeed , said canon pennyfather quickly .
a young widowmrs .
nevertheless , as he went down the stairs some of the confidence faded from his face .
i think he probably tried to say something when he was dying that should give us the clue .
oh no , said miss marple , i didnt mean that .
well , i said id like to , and to tell the truth , i was a bit excited about it .
that is easily said , said clare derisively .
they said it would be quite easy to sell it to someone elsein fact there were several people who had been bitterly disappointed about it .
no as a matter of fact he paused .
the beach at kimpton is a long , straight stretch of sand .
he was misjudged by his housemaster and i consider the authorities at oxford behaved quite disgracefully .
gave way , but he was sad about it .
renisenbs steps quickened as she took the way to the cliff path .
brown , said sir james dryly .
i believe his original name was stanfield or stanley , or something like that .
he leaned back in his chair pleased with the effect he had created .
he looked round as though to say goodbye to someone else and then started .
tuesdays and thursdayspunctual as a clock .
hugo shook his head .
i must travel in an ordinary carriage .
often have , havent i , bella , old girl ?
arent you coming , edward ?
he muttered .
but i think there might be a little more than that .
somehow , said archie , it seemed so reasonable the way he put it .
a dark stain welled up slowly on his left side and trickled slowly on to the concrete of the pool edge ; and from there dripped red into the blue water .
there will be much to do tomorrow .
yes im sure it was .
but i cant make it out .
ah , par example !
he had the stamp of the seedy townsman upon him .
so i think we can assume that the maid was not a really trustworthy character .
but as he went home he muttered to himself : canalsi wonder .
vivien flinched back as though she had been struck .
which means , finished mrs .
repentance !
your bossy friend .
when he finally packed up and went i had a feeling almost of reliefhe had made up his mind .
he lied so well .
and then our lives will go on happily ever afterwards , said philip in his mocking voice .
i dont suppose really he looked queer at all , said tuppence .
in a design of sour grapes and thistles , i suppose ?
hugo arranged that i should be asked down here .
her eyes held just that quality of mild inquiring surprise .
edgware would never have agreed .
you could go on in that , sir , and id bring the car along later as soon as its fixed up .
no , said poirot , i think it will be better not .
i went for a stroll by myself .
i should say that was the way of it .
that sounds unlike him .
its curious , said miss wetherby , that hes never mentioned it .
sutcliffe , with certainty .
a man of iron , with muscles like taut steel .
what is your view of it ?
surely deirdres old enough not to knock things down the whole time .
and youve got the damned nerve to come along and say , give it all up , dear .
wellim afraid i may be to blame there .
it was for the jury to make their own decision .
couldnt get a comb through it .
her factswell , thats more difficult .
she went to ireland , did she ?
you should have seen that picture crale was painting .
she seemed a smart wide-awake bit of goods .
but i was so miserable .
he thought : peaceful sound .
this is highly irregular .
no , a firm from london , so it was saidbut a lot of the men who came down were foreigners .
did you want me ?
then , with a slight air of performing a duty long overdue , she glanced round her vaguely and murmured : i expect you know everybody .
what is it that you think ?
the deep pit became rather frightening after a while , because they had to dig down ninety feet to virgin soil .
you must not let them send you away .
it had even been said that the dead man had refused his only brother assistance .
poirot yawned once more .
poirot , bella ?
he thought you meant mariethe girl who came to me after juanita left .
i put it aside with the thingsthe very many thingsthat dont matter in life .
mother rapidly soothed me and administered a dose of ipecacuanha winealways kept in the medicine cupboard in those daysand assured me that i was not due to die this time .
said colonel melrose .
meet me by rolland copse .
she wanted to say , you fool , if theres anybody i care about , its you .
) evidence against her or suspicious circumstances : none .
butwellit is our own private tragedy , and i think you will understand , m .
you meanthats why he died ?
he may have got his information about mr .
he ' s going to be cut out from under her nose and taken to walk in the moonlight on the boat deck .
there had been an eyelash in the fold of the paper this morning .
the trouble is ive no earthly means of knowing which is right .
nothing really ever excited carlotta except money .
' what do you know , m .
carrie louise was standing by the window and miss marple joined her .
note : lord mayfield near-sighted can read without glasses but has to use a monocle tt look across a room .
he said : has anything happened ?
how thrilling !
jane looked more fogged than ever .
when i began the usual stunt of saying you were engaged with scotland yard , he told me he knew all about that .
the more you said you were sane , the less theyd believe you .
and there is no body found in my hotel ?
where am i myself , the whole man , the true man ?
it was suggestive , that wasp .
and then lottyno , letty .
there was a short silence , and then the doctor said : hound .
much to mr withers sorrow , he did see .
yes , i can tell you very quickly , said tuppence .
a wonderful high note , full-throated , powerful , hit full in the middle , a note any singer might be proud of .
presently , after various puffs at his pipe , he said thoughtfully : youve got a lot of scalps , agatha , havent you ?
encourage her to think herself one of the family .
are you aware of your mothers real name ?
we met there once before , crossing a bridge .
it seemed to me , you see , that verity would have said nothing to the people who could have stopped her .
and now here was his widow , rather cushion-like in shape and dressed in wispy artistic black with festoons of jet beads , back in the home of her girlhood , moving about and touching things and exclaiming with pleasure when she recalled some childish memory .
she was very fond of her niece and nephew .
' he went with them , laughing .
and mind you , its only an idea .
but not with both at once ?
eberhard has been down there with him .
did a woman kill him and did she deliberately drop a pipe cleaner to make it look like a mans work ?
she took her golf clubs and announced her intention of doing so .
en verit ?
just give him a fright .
there was a pillow behind her head , and she seemed to have been asleep .
they seemed to me to be slightly artificial , if you know what i mean .
well in the sixties .
there are rocks everywhere .
butcher , baker , grocer , quite a good antique shoptwo tea shops .
i knew madame droulard had cataracts the atropine drops told me that .
neasden took the note from marshalls hand and handed it to the chief constable .
only two reasons really .
what kind of a job ?
oh , it was just a joke .
i expect you noticed , just as the colonel did , what shaitana said at dinner .
shed want you to tell me .
abernethie died .
if a young man wishes to tell lies , he should do so well , said miss percehouse .
with another boisterous laugh she disappeared through the french windows .
that wont matter , will it ?
well , thats neither here nor there , but what i want you to do is something quite different .
decidedly .
and comparing the crimes , i rather doubt it .
he was busy thinking what to do next .
integration ?
she was a fat child with small blue eyes and a rather piggy kind of prettiness .
that settles it , he remarked .
yes , she had heard all right .
all the troubles in the world can be put down to moneyor the lack of it .
it gives him away .
i have been an imbecile , my friends !
hes such a nice gentleman , captain marshall .
she had been beautiful .
seems quite like a fairy tale ?
very disappointing .
poirot , staring after her , felt a hand on his shoulder .
anyone can die of what is amateurishly called heart failure , from one of several different causes .
isnt the world small ?
no theory of accident will hold water for a minute .
poirot murmured : quel pays sauvage !
theres something , i can see .
two short monthsthat was all they had had .
certainly rosemary had seemed happy enough .
this is for my own satisfaction .
yes , its jane .
pray be seated , messieurs , said poirot politely .
she started to tell me , but was interrupted .
this , it is persecution !
what the devillet go of me .
banks wasnt to know if he was or he wasnt .
do you know when he had it last ?
really , of course , she fainted , and john oglander carried her across over his shoulders .
perhaps he stayed here in the laurels .
his glass left eye was glaring over my shoulder , but what he saw with his other eye was a man sitting by a hibiscus bush and the face was the same , only rather older , as the face in the snapshot .
joyces son , william , had been killed in action in burma , and the money he left went to his father .
sophia came out of the front door .
miss clegg was her name , and she was a very superior woman and highly thought of in the village .
poirot adopted a very confidential , gossipy tone .
yes , the lake - ' japp gave him a quick glance .
you met her , if you will throw your mind back , during the time that you persuaded me to investigate the murder of mrs .
for answer , the little man rose and crossed the room to where newspapers were filed .
that was mrs .
three near escapes from death in three days .
what they called a gentleman farmer .
inspector craddock did not even trouble to reject this speculation .
she took to her heels and ran , still clasping the brown paper packet .
was his story of photographs to develop a lie invented upon the spur of the moment ?
she seems pretty certain now .
red , is it not ?
it didnt , for instance , fit in with that word safer .
i thought her very empty-headed andwell , mercenary .
it is because , hastings , i chose to be sporting .
i have not seen him .
i remember how she stood looking down at yahmoseand how she cried out : you must not do things like that , sobekit is dangerous !
i married one of the locals out here .
jean dupont confirmed this evidence .
he said quickly : its nothing .
im afraid to be alone .
in due course he reached the cardonet and turned in at the door of no .
quins arrival , no fortuitous chance , but the appearance of an actor when his cue was given .
her family has lived here a long time .
yes , that explains his attitude very well .
possibly the wretched girls name in all the papers .
it was like a searchlight , said miss marple , illuminating things on a dark night .
she always gets upset if shes startled .
the letter to the lawyer .
of course its not true .
rogers cried : i didnt know what it was .
sharks , all of you !
i suppose it doesnt matter , said julia slowly .
oh , its empty .
they will understand , im sure , said max .
if you also frequent it , we shall no doubt meet before very long .
' she gave a little gasp .
it arrived , i remember , at breakfast .
anyway , well , iter yes , said tuppence , it what ?
every kind of language they talkyes , hattie ?
she was strainingstraining the whole time to make that face come nearershe felt sick , ill , miserable .
he slashed with his stick at some tall foxgloves , and , frowning , he said : she ought not to have come .
that was when what ?
he was shaking now .
she was devoted to her husband and very ambitious for him .
hes coming here in a yacht .
weve got cust on the doncaster murderthe bloodstained coat , the knifenot a loophole there .
tell me where to go and i will go there .
one supposes so .
she smiled at me when i came in and did not speak .
' he cried .
i caught a flicker of surprise and recognition in mrs .
what i have told you , he said authoritatively , is strictly confidential .
savage , having heard that doctors usually conceal from a patient the fact that he is suffering from that disease , would interpret this according to his own lights .
something of that kind might supply a motive .
absolutely nothingthats just the curious part of it .
tommy turned to tuppence .
emma leaned back and heaved a sigh .
and if you are not careful i will go !
match-folder .
who accompanied him said that that would not be necessary .
and then when she sank down breathless , she would tell us of what she meant to do and to be .
tommy said confidently : we shall be in time , sir .
suddenly , as we were just moving out of taunton , poirot uttered a piercing squeal .
no , wed no idea they were even in england , said jason rudd .
you and captain hastings breakfast at a reasonable hour , i am glad to see .
achmed ali has some extremely pornographic literature and postcards which explains why he went up in the air over the search .
' japp ' s search was quick but efficient .
jolly few have been poisoned with eight grains of morphia and got over it , bobby pointed out .
with me ?
oh , no , maam , not mr .
henrietta shivered slightly .
tim kendal started .
he recited with the utmost solemnity : dilly , dilly , dillycome and be killed .
wu ling had kept much to himself on the voyage .
ii should not do this , i know .
it is true that it does not gleam and reflect the light , but all the same you are prepared to admit that that brooch could be seen plainly from some distance away ?
a suggestive word , is it not ?
plates , glasses , roast chicken , and a rather peculiar pink pudding were served at the first meal .
it may be dangerous for youbut youll find out , wont you ?
i admit josephines got into rather difficult waysshes got a horrible habit of snooping .
but of course now celia and i are getting married i shall leave it to celiaand i didnt like the way my mother tried to put me against celia .
say they were near the gates of a big house at the time .
and again : let her say : of course .
the time of mrs .
with her she took a small overnight bag since she would have a three hours drive before she even arrived at the area of operations , and after that , it meant , she judged , a good deal of slow driving along country roads and lanes looking for likely canals .
if he doesnt improve i shall sack him and try again .
however , she thought , i can always call julian to help me .
yet all through i was conscious of some barrier between usa constraint on his part , the reason of which i could not fathom .
she was standing by desmond lee-wortley , her hand on his arm , looking up into his face .
akibombo , said inspector sharpe , resignedly , lets hear , please , what all this is about .
thats an idea , that is .
as though it were last week againas though joe trevelyan hadnt diedas though nothing had happened or were changed .
see you , my dear doctor , me , i am not one to rely upon the expert procedure .
twelve passage of arms the afternoon of the tennis party was fortunately fine .
i asked mr .
said isaacstein .
oh , cried dora bunner , shocked .
clarissa shouted .
i call it splendid of you to come and tell us this , i said .
oliver looked happy .
oh well , i said , its got a curse on it .
a very meticulous and accurate account , he said kindly .
but ill just say this .
he murmured to himself : yes , there is timejust time .
came back and turned in round about midnight .
we put ammonia on it .
i suppose everyone knows the picture : a stretch of road with a trench dug down it , the turned earth , reddish in colour , a shining length of brown glazed drainpipe and the huge navvy , resting for a minute on his spadea herculean figure in stained corduroys with a scarlet neckerchief .
a daughter , for instance ?
she talked of packing up and leaving .
in my opinion , you ought to put yourself in the hands of a thoroughly good solicitor .
it was as though we were trying to reach each other , and finding , almost with dismay , that we had forgotten how to do so .
_num_ , hercule poirot is almost ideally placed to observe his fellow air travelers on this short flight from paris to london .
archie , how extraordinary !
i dont understand what hes up to at all , said adam .
whatever conflicting details these people give , they all saw one thing .
the count rose , picked up his handsome stick from the corner , and , with rather a curt bow , left the room .
deane was fathers curate once , and he had a little girl called monica , about four or five years younger than me .
her mouth opened and she began screaming again .
undeterred by colonel races sardonic comments , she snapped vigorously : there , thats the end of the roll .
there were little beads of sweat on his forehead as he rejoined them , and his face was dead white .
nothings too good for her !
it seems so stupid to go and commit a murder unless its absolutely necessary .
my friend , miss grey , i mean ?
proud cities that were , are now mere mounds of earth , overgrown with rank vegetation , and the poor hovels of men who just manage to keep alive , no more .
i considered first of all theresa arundell .
a very sad business all this , i said .
she usually wore out one poor devil a year .
fancy saying a thing like that .
i depend upon her , went on mr .
its the sort of thing boys might do all over the worldnot perhaps really meaning any harm .
he was a short thickset man .
girls are always shy and awkward when theyve just left school before theyre properly grown up .
some of them are temperamental enough , said hilary , drily .
he claims that he ought then to have had some inkling of what was likely to occur .
he wheeled round quickly and politely .
and i ' m afraid , i _num_ tell you - i ' m afraid .
yes , is is rather .
under the circumstances , however , mr .
yes , i think freda clegg will do excellently .
the whole case for the murder of richard abernethie rests upon those words .
his voice half asked a question .
hallo , what was this ?
its this confounded fog .
but the thief may escape with them !
what could be simpler ?
parents are determined that their offspring shall shine .
he said , after a minute or two : but what , exactly , is the present trouble about ?
she had heard a noise in the hall below and had looked over the banisters .
you remember all that fuss we had four years ago ?
shed be liable to stand accused of murder .
anyway , i enjoyed myself scribbling down ideas for the hollow .
george went on with every appearance of enjoyment .
he had certainly not been in love with her on the few occasions we had met her previously .
but its not so easy to find the right person .
was there someone searching for something in the cottage that day , who seized the opportunity of both the women being away ?
that was his trump card : lack of motive .
willett who had taken charge of the situation , not he .
confused ?
he looked about seventy , but tuppence presumed he was not quite as far advanced in age as that , though he was certainly rheumatic and rather unsteady on his legs .
its all such nonsense .
gordon cloade may get a shock one day .
' benedict farley was staring straight ahead of him .
oh , edward !
i must go through with this business to the end .
im sure i couldnt say , sir , what miss wills thought about it .
i saw that the corners of her mouth and the skin of her chin were burnt a kind of greyish white .
meredith blake had a tradition of devotion to caroline crale lasting over many years .
poor girl , thatll be boring for her .
i think miss waynflete suspected .
well , the dollar not dollars , said mr .
you cant expect the mere man in the streetliterally the man in the streetto distinguish between bad germans and good germans , if i may put it so crudely .
she didnt suspect her husband of trying to do her in ?
she was very silent , hardly opening her lips , and yet in some queer way i felt that the great strength of her personality was dominating us all .
both _num_ and _num_ are better cabins , he reiterated .
i really remember her much better when she was five years old than at any other age .
you mean the bodys thereat nasse , hidden somewhere where weve never thought of looking .
he has said so .
but this will save me ringing up , which i hate .
however , that was only the beginning .
you were lying down ?
he listenednothing .
when you came in to change for tennis that morning , did you have a bath ?
isnt that so , doctor ?
the times called it a brilliant story and the sunday times found it very well contrived .
pengelleys feelings towards her husband to be ?
dont be a little fool !
now isnt that funny , because we know harrods quite well , dont we , little dear ?
you see , mrs .
for the first time , she left her post , and rushed wildly for the figure at the window .
basil blake has just been arrested for the murder of ruby keene .
reigate also leaves me cold .
deuced odd business , said the colonel .
where youd find some hidden treasure .
julius hersheimmer set out to discover what had become of his cousin .
he listened with keen attention to my story .
that there was very little likelihood of some of them having committed it was a secondary matter .
poirot picked it upthen laid it down with a grimace .
i do not think there ever can be proof .
well , hes dead all right .
allens bedroom .
he had a certain disdain for tangible evidence , such as footprints and cigarette ash , and would maintain that , taken by themselves , they would never enable a detective to solve a problem .
do not move till i come .
nothing easier than to slip a dose of harmless narcotic into my bottle of winethe bottles stand on the tables all day .
the party seems to have gone off very merrily , i said with a slight shiver .
christine redfern said : nonsense .
where was everyone ?
emily had always given out quite openly that at her death her money was to be divided between her nieces and her nephew .
it has changed hands rather frequentlythere was a rumour at one moment of a compulsory purchase order .
its all very well for you to sit there being funny , tommy .
and then , m .
we had been ships that pass in the night .
its very kind , mrs .
she had better brains than george and could have avoided any trap that he was likely to set with the greatest of ease .
we always do want the same things , said tuppence happily .
but i dont see what reason any one of them could have had .
shes dead too .
not quite the same thing , is it ?
some archaeological congress or other .
though , of course , she was saying , never real cloak and dagger stuff .
there are always opportunitieseven in prison .
i confess , he said , that i am utterly baffled .
the second was an appointment with a dressmaker .
it might well be .
of shoes and ships and sealing wax , and cabbages and kings .
well , dear , she said .
a competent young career woman of thirty-odd , not particularly good-looking .
she drew the lion necklace from her dress and handed it to him .
but someone would have heard heard what ?
i wonder what we shall have for tea , said griselda , seating herself on my writing table .
he tries to wrench it away from her and in the struggle he fires it and kills her .
a mound created by the falling down of a former greenhouse .
didnt know whether he was dead drunk , or ill .
charlotte didnt really feel that what she suddenly thought of doing was wrongnot really wrong .
he was distracted by a sound at his side .
bobby informed his father that he would be going up to town on monday week to take up a job .
hercule poirot said cautiously : it is possible .
gardener would have believed in a crime staged here .
but the way she said it now was differentas though the monsieur , slightly stressed , was somehow very amusing .
she was shocked and distressed but no more .
he looked up as poirot entered .
it still runs , you know , but it gets here an hour and a half later .
was the family prostrated by grief ?
now you know it all .
i had my plan .
i blame the mistress for that , for its my belief it turned the child sour .
he said i had the makings of a born detective in meand a wonderful psychological insight into human nature .
my lord , yesterday afternoon one of your guests left this house in a curious manner .
during recent bouts of pain , i had been ordered a sleeping draughtchloral hydrate .
i dont wonder .
but i didnt see anything .
a great grunt from major burnaby .
nothing that cannot be discussed later .
stokes although hes been struck off .
everythings ready , said her husband with a kind of ferocious geniality .
sir eustace is going to the mount nelson hotel in cape town and then up to rhodesia .
thats strange , ive seen him before somewhere .
thats what she did , didnt she ?
i loved my father .
the hut was partitioned into two , on the right-hand side , a girls yellow sweater , a battered panama hat and a pair of beach shoes were depending from a peg .
it lulled elinor almost into unconsciousness .
one would presume , said mr robinson , in his calm voice , that she is trying to obtain information .
as richard began to stammer irresolutely , i that is the butler interrupted him .
he was last seen heading for the grange , went on frankie .
he was the great , the unique hercule poirot , but he was also a very old man and his shoes were tight .
good night , mrs boynton .
with a tropical temperso it is said .
you see , sir , i never thought for one moment that he meant it .
oh , no , not mrs .
to build a house like that nowadays would cost every penny of six thousand , let alone the land value and the valuable frontages .
the whole thing was very complicated .
i consider its significance .
i have answered them !
said luke bluntly .
well , it would be of course .
he just went on and i followed him .
so that was that , and i promised to do my best .
thats all right , said joanna .
he slips off his shoes , climbs in , andwell , i dont need to go into details .
after all , said poirot reflectively , it was an experience !
that must have presented a difficulty .
packington mentioned that he might not be home to dinner that evening as he had to see a man on business .
on outside of window , on decanter , on brandy glass overlaying prints of richard warwick and angell and mrs laura warwick , on cigarette lighterand on the revolver .
ive always been so afraid , you know , that these young people would be bored by our christmas here .
he realized that miss waynflete differed from miss pinkerton in having a more logical mind and better processes of thought .
chimneys .
and was bertrams hotel going cheap ?
probably a wild-goose chase , said fournier as they left the shop .
up to then it had been , oh , just lighthearted fooling .
that was closed too and the windows were shut .
that superstitious notion of its being the hand of god ?
he wrote plays .
miss marple nodded her head as bunch finished .
yes , said poirot , in a somewhat dissatisfied voice .
we all got into the car .
what it will say i do not know , but it will be sufficient for you to make plans immediately to return to england .
well , he did , sir .
you and lady chevenix-gore came down together ?
it looked bloodless .
jacquelines voice came thick and blurred .
claude luttrell , mrs .
she felt sick and shaken and full of a nameless fear .
the reproof was dignified , but unmistakable .
i thought you had given up crows nest for good .
do not say you want to start over again .
used to be st .
bauerstein has been arrested ?
caroline , i said , do you never reflect that you might do a lot of harm with this habit of yours of repeating everything indiscriminately ?
please yourselves !
gerald was silent for a minute or two , then he said slowly : ames was willing to take two thousand in cash and the remaining thousand on mortgage .
aristides , is on you .
whereas , in actual fact , she brought you the exact opposite , he said drily .
nobody else to leave it to .
bobby stretched himself out on a brackeny bank and debated with himself whether he should eat his lunch first and go to sleep afterwards , or sleep first and eat afterwards .
shes not your aunt .
he said : yes , i do , and thats flat !
the other , with sleek brushed-back hair and a rather obvious style of good looks , he put down as of a definitely inferior social class .
her good sense told her that there was nothing else to do but accept the situation .
miss brewis gave the domestic equivalent of a barrister saying as your lordship pleases .
and taking the other point of view , he went on , suppose leo came out of the mists and shadows of the self-contained world that hes managed to live in so long .
so we must go farther afield .
he added : well , what about it ?
one glass of port , and i will be with you , for one , declared sir alington .
she liked christine redfern .
we dined together in the restaurant .
and its gay .
we are speaking now from the psychological point of view .
you were up early enough , heaven knows .
that is not at all a proper question for me to answer , said mr .
whatwhat could there be ?
ahim quite tired , too .
the murderer ?
and the fishmongers young man , he says hed never have believed it of colonel bantrynot with him handing round the plate on sundays and all .
its in our jurisdiction .
it was the same dagger i had seen reposing in the glass jar the preceding morning !
faded ink , crumbling paper .
a bad crowdnot one of them would stick at perjury .
leave your fingerprints and your measuring of handwriting and your microscopes .
tina seems in the clear , unworried , unaffected .
who was the letter written to ?
caroline would forgive him as she had done so often before , and elsaelsa would just have to lump it .
the patient this and the patient that .
you , my good , my honest , my oh so honourable hastingsso kindly , so conscientiousso innocent !
there are times , said midge , when i feel i dont care about anything else .
those small cases were no business of yours .
gerald wade , another very gallant gentleman who died in the same way .
he liked her distinction , the graceful lines of her figure , the alert proud carriage of her head .
i put my hand into my pocket to look at the paper i had picked up once more .
perhaps she was right .
michael looked suddenly black as thunder .
and it is the same everywheresatipy rails at yahmose far into the nightwe can all hear her .
i didnt think i should get anything more out of him .
she crept very quietly along it , keeping close to the shadow of the house .
miss pinkertons death was even more difficult , because i couldnt imagine miss waynflete dressed up as a chauffeur driving a rolls .
my first you put on glowing coalthats pot .
mon ami , said poirot apologetically , as i told you at the time , one must say something .
but you are well aware , chre madame , he said , that that would be a waste of time .
you dont know what youre looking for .
youve got to remember .
my wife was murdered .
david crossed to the telephone .
her secretaryi am referring to mrs .
and rex fortescue was a liar !
are youare you , by any chance ?
his hands were clenched round the polishing leather that he held in his hand .
her mind recurred again to mr .
he has often reproached me with not speaking the truth .
brazenly on the make .
you are too generous .
no , i never actually met her .
so cleverand then , well , the fat would be in the fire , to use an old-fashioned expression .
letters of invitation , letters pressing for payment of accounts , letters from friends .
yesi can understand that from your point of view .
what credulous creatures we are , really .
good-bye , miss lytton gore , and i hope the article will be a great success .
parrott sounded apologetic again .
he shook his head , then his face brightened .
im being truthful , m .
a plain woman , was melchetts first impression .
we have reason to believe that in every country there are agents of this group , some established there many years ago .
the room might have been empty as far as she was concerned .
i met sophia leonides out in cairo .
why shouldnt you be making it all up ?
eight of them boys , and five miscarriages .
she is to pull the roasting chestnuts out of the fire .
it may have been bostol or broadsandone of those places beginning with b as they sent him to .
the kindnessthe wonderful kindness of dear miss arundell .
well , i like this one .
was it like her illness of two years before ?
an adolescent , rather silly girl , her head full of film stars and glamourthere were hundreds of marlenes .
too penetrating .
he introduced his daughter-in-law , who shepherded deirdre through the cool , dark inner hall to a bedroom beyond , where she could remove the veil with which she was always careful to shield her complexion when motoring .
doctor haydock said abruptly to his niece , whats all this nonsense about old mrs .
then he said surprisingly : no , i do not think so .
the crime was not committed som .
oliver , ruefully , not to be able to be definite .
they didnt expect it , said poirot .
well , i didnt want to overhear any more .
if parker heard anything about blackmail , i said slowly , he must have been listening outside this door with his ear glued against the keyhole .
what i want to sayand believe it my dutyis to put my own explanation of the mystery before you .
flew em to milan .
each of us , i honestly believe , was willing to stand aside for the other to go in and win .
another gin and orange , and whisky , marcus commanded .
even that chance reference of mademoiselle nicks to the offer made her by m .
yes , maam .
he did it so naturally that no one thought it odd that this stranger , who had just arrived , should suddenly assume charge of the situation .
anyone who says i do lies !
fournier wondered why .
its an interesting idea .
' it is a pretty alibi you have the ' e .
i rehung it on the wall , put the magazine back in my coat pocket , and crept back to bed .
he exclaimed to himself , as he looked again at the envelope .
miss bulstrode did not pay very much attention to this criticism .
the man was so near him that , but for the intervening glass , he could have stretched out his arm and touched him .
she was opinionated and a staunch conservative .
with the shock of a blow , aunt kathies voice came thinly through the wire .
and then suddenly , from feeling a little sorry for the boy , it came over me that he was very likely a cold-blooded murderer and had been playing a part all the time .
very solid ground .
but im afraid you cant see her .
hell be rather disappointed when you dont return , i said .
couldnt there now ?
possibly i could save his life from drowning firsta grateful queen would give her royal consent .
chapter eight though personally deprecating le five oclock as inhibiting the proper appreciation of the supreme meal of the day , dinner , poirot was now getting quite accustomed to serving it .
susan did not answer , and into georges mind there leapt a swift birds eye view of another figure .
perhaps id better go out and do something with truelove .
his arm fastened round her arm .
perhaps dear griselda would be so very kind as to run over here and cheer up my nephew .
he had no clue to what was in her mind .
but i saw him kiss you one nighton the terrace .
he was thinking furiously .
dont put me off .
the millionaires chin shot out grimly .
it seemed advisable to find out as soon as possible exactly what mr .
there was the usual creak outside on the landing as the elevator came to a halt and in a minute or two mrs fellows-brown , accompanied by her pekinese , came puffing into the room rather like a fussy local train arriving at a wayside station .
inglethorp made a new will .
whitfield , with an air of enjoyment , that death duties would have been enormous .
i asked whether mrs .
the police have already unearthed the matter .
so he ought to be , said miss bellever .
ah , said tuppence .
my own line of research has been somewhat similar , though not undertaken with the same end in view .
he was a very generous manand altogether a warm-hearted and lovable person .
and in consequence the boy did not forget her ?
then no one can say he had a motive for wishing his aunt out of the way .
edward , do you think it will be me next ?
cousins ?
but that is the time in the paper ?
you cant take a girl of twenty to london and buy her clothes without a most frightful scandal .
started immediately after the inquest .
he said : is that a reason ?
but i wasnt having any then !
i meanbar a small subscriptionand even that was made out to the society , not to her personally .
you know old man rysdale ?
its a matter i feel rather hotly about .
we have noticed a good deal , you know , in the course of a lifetime .
in his perplexity he took the simplest and most straightforward course on the following morning , he asked his secretary , miss lemon .
i was in a position now to judge the case for myself .
but yes , it was most simple .
she was positively purring .
donovan put in a firm disclaimer , and jimmy backed him up .
do you think someone really wants to do away with me ?
i thought you was a sight better .
three people sat down to a supper consisting , amongst other things , of tinned lobster .
she spoke simply .
even if you brought it me , i should not drink it .
and so , what happened ?
another illusion gone .
first rate .
madness , hastings , is a terrible thingi am afraidi am very much afraid .
david was in a superior position from the startthe man with a long-distance weapon against the man who had none .
in fact , i wouldnt much have objected to putting her out of the way myself .
otherwise there might have been an accident .
id no business to make out it was worse for me than anyone else .
but not to me .
have you felt yourself that something waswrong ?
much obliged , im sure .
she seems to think of nothing but saving .
do you adore to see it the way it is now ?
have you any money , frankie ?
elvira blake came through .
yet sometimes , especially if we had a party of young people in for supper , when we went up to the schoolroom afterwards , suddenly grannie would appear , creeping slowly and with difficulty up the stairs .
she added , rather cattily , but sir george was not in the mood to appreciate cattiness , of course you could put an advertisement in vogue .
it wasnt bigger bathrooms and larger houses and more electric light fittings and bigger meals and faster cars .
i should say your judgment was usually most reliable .
lancasterno rooms booked for themor any trace of their having stayed there before .
said the major , loyal to that tradition .
he cried , and sprang to meet me .
miss pinkerton was swallowed up in the crowd .
again she shot a sudden , piercing look at poirot .
married that fellow nevile strange .
norton said rather comically : and sometimesoh blessed death , eh ?
miss johnson , kelsey reminded her , came and woke you up .
he wondered if he had been right or wrong in thinking that his last question had in some way perturbed mrs .
julia was a plain freckled child , with an intelligent forehead , and an air of good humour .
now , speak the truth to me again .
the great thing is not to have any unpleasantness this weekend .
hed got what he came for and was clearing out .
before , i was undecided .
she had an original mind , he thought , a reflective mind .
i remember her well .
as he got to the other side of the steep descent , the young man came out from the trees to meet him .
lord dittisham murmured : i knowi know .
in the winter , he said firmly , i do not leave london .
herr spiess , you have always been a great military nationrebellions must be put down by armed forces before they get out of hand .
may i ask if you have an intimate knowledge oferher various business transactions ?
and whats that , may i ask ?
my little purser came to scratch splendidly .
rather fantastic ?
my dear .
excuse me , i said , there was .
theyre going to drown us !
i really would like to explaintoerclarify my position .
i dont quite see what you mean , miss marple , said dr lloyd .
poirot paused , letting the words sink in , then went on : the thought of death , her death , passed through every mindof that i am certain .
but by that time the villains would have got an excellent start .
it was quite possible that her actions in the caribbean had saved esther walters from being murdered in the not far distant future .
i went away quietly , realizing sadly how unfit poirot was now for any sustained effort .
sir george had olaened one of the french windows .
they do that to you nowadays , the landlords .
entwhistle , goes equally to you and the nieces and nephew .
in an encouraging manner .
monsieur poirot , she addressed him as she closed the door , tredwell tells me you wanted to see me .
frankly i didnt .
i shall be on the platform .
' _num_ jane plenderleith raised her eyebrows .
to you , madame .
i have a perfect recollection of the afternoon in question , replied lady westholme .
she turned her head over her shoulder .
sending the whole country to blazes .
the whole thing is rather strange .
when a woman is not happy in her home he left the sentence unfinished .
suppose she were to get pneumoniapeople did after flua young friend of hers had died that way only last winter .
stillingfleet in her case .
a clear tropical night , frogs croaking .
i can see you mean it .
it is true what you said , only i had never thought of it that way before .
midge looked sideways at henriettas profile .
but she liked meshe did like meit wasnt just a bit of fun to her .
iii the small quiet voice of mr .
very sensible of you .
perhaps he thought youd seen something that you didnt think was anything but which really was something .
what an impoliteness !
you didnt try and find out who sent them ?
oh , good !
the man on the ground turned his head over his shoulder .
away from everybody .
you know your masters moods .
i see the point of your rose between the lips now , i said , laughing .
yeshe had become mad , perhaps .
youre very concerned about this unknown lady , james ?
she never admits taking anything .
to arrange a good marriage , one must take more than romance into consideration .
you know what i mean , mrs .
major bletchley looked thoughtfully at his audience : miss minton , mrs .
its nannie .
it really was three thousand , said alix .
oh , dear , sighed esther .
my partner , miss hobhouse , is not here today .
tim says he believes she drank .
they are giving it to megiving it to me .
no , you dont dermot had been about to make a rush at him , but the other had suddenly produced an ugly-looking revolver .
i was not sure then if inglethorp was the criminal or not , but if he was i reasoned that he would not have the paper on him , but would have hidden it somewhere , and by enlisting the sympathy of the household i could effectually prevent his destroying it .
the judge nodded gently .
you mean that someone extracted the stuff on the premises .
perhaps shed got hold of something important .
so far , so good , but the impostor could not afford actually to arrive here , since you were acquainted with the real winnie .
exclaimed richard , angrily .
and she , iris , hadnt known a thing about it !
i cannot bear it .
make an appointment ?
kirsten lindstrom agreed .
certainly i was compelled to admit that the man who had visited us from hanwell had fitted in exactly with my idea of what an asylum attendant should look like .
once i brought drinks to the two ladies .
why to me ?
not judith and allerton .
on the morning we were leaving , she asked me to take it up to town and drop it at her jewellers in bond street .
there were several bequestsone to the natural history museumbut the bulk of his largehis , i may say , very large fortunehe left to captain michael seton absolutely .
the person you really want to get in touch with is mr .
he said , you should have reported that to the police .
parker pyne , im no end obliged to you .
unfortunately they got clear away .
oh , no , it is by no means all .
this is margharita clayton .
but mollyshe seems to have them nearly all the time .
was that not your wishes , sir ?
hemp distorting the time factor , so that she might believe an experience has lasted an hour instead of a few minutes .
and then i thought idwait !
most uncommon in this country , fairly common among the natives in egypt .
the archaeological life ?
bantry , with a sigh .
not that i believe everything im told .
horbury was standing beside his chair .
the financial side was run by the hoffman brothers .
he pressed the bell at the side .
the answer to that is no , said jenny slowly .
a dog , i cried .
one young nurse had been very keen on this fortune telling stunt , and for a time mrs pritchard had been very fond of her .
he sighed happily .
i dont like this , he told them .
if they are badly frightened , especially by something they dont understand , they dont talk about it .
that lithe swaying figure belonged to one person onlymr .
as she replaced each one , she sorted them automatically into tidy little heaps .
cornworthy shrugged his shoulders .
she met my glance with a faint desperate smile and a nod of the head .
do not worry , said poirot smoothly .
old montys been had up for being drunk in charge of a car .
he felt old , chilly , alone .
there was no sign that jennifer recognized that this was actually a sketch of mademoiselle blanche .
it nearly got me , tonight .
no , on second thoughts you shall be taking notes in shorthand from my dictation .
no doubt i am very dense , but i cannot see what the proximity of the coast has got to do with the murder of mrs .
but , of course , im funny that way , lily , what i like is class .
properly registered company .
he looked at her curiously .
you saw him come out , close the door behind him , and walk away from you down the deck andperhapsenter one of the two end cabins .
if it all could be cleared up quickly , said tim .
all right , he said curtly .
a shadow had come between her and the sun .
it bore the inscription , mendles hotel , melbourne .
i do not want a second tragedy in my rooms !
i even cooked the poison book !
after a few moments , he got up .
probably heaps of things , said philip .
he and i together put our shoulders to the door .
there are other ways .
id say they did .
no , no , i shant want one .
that is the story these three woman tellbut there is conflicting evidence .
the other was only an excuse , eh ?
perenna who had been speaking from mrs .
like a blessed baa lamb .
if it hadnt been dated !
the walls were more or less lined with books and cupboards , the centre conveniently free and empty .
is she , you old dog ?
now , didnt i tell you last night that that man had an evil face ?
say anything , you will .
such a logical approach !
sally interrupted him .
she said , but it was hardly a question .
i went straight upstairs and turned in .
only surviving brother .
you can enjoy leisure ; you can enjoy things .
doesnt worry us any .
do you deny that you offered her the sum of ten thousand dollars to impersonate miss jane wilkinson at the house that night ?
naturally there were more modern streets , and a few slightly more modern shops , but the noble islamic buildings , the courts , the tiles and the fountainsthey were all there still .
aunt edith takes digitalin for her heart .
it appears , sir , that about a week ago you and a mr .
in my view , the police were guilty of gross carelessness in not checking the original fragment more closely and in jumping to the conclusion that it was a morphine label .
with an inner feeling of being something of a detective , mr .
perhaps youll start , mr .
his fingers closed round it .
presently we said goodbye to mr .
he murmured : ' it is beautifully in order , is it not ?
the face she turned to mrs .
but with somethinggrey eyes that might perhaps see too much .
what do you mean , my friend ?
she turned on me .
if im going to cooperate with you , we must look about for some other creamy crime , i said with a laugh .
something gripped him ; he stood quite still , as though frozen into immobility .
i do not think you have quite finished , he said .
we are really the last of the family , except for some very distant cousins .
the coroner nodded approval .
i left miss french about five minutes to nine .
let me tell you !
i mean he following you instead of you following himonly it was earlierand i had a sort of uneasy feeling .
she seems to be wise to everything that goes on in that house .
she admitted it , smiling .
no , no , of course i wont .
i think im more proud of that than anything else .
none of that , young fellow .
that telephone message on the telephone pad in the hallwhy did i keep thinking of it ?
one of your brutes nearly pinned me by the leg last week .
you could hardly call it a case .
i knew the name that selma goetz passed under in genoa .
it appeared to be her favourite one .
will you kindly explain , miss bowers ?
much better than the morning one .
profession ?
very ingenious !
poirot spread out the sheets on the table and began to read .
all the abernethie crowd were at the funeral .
how unscrupulous you are , mother !
one has only to reasonto reflect .
yes , i think it does .
flowers and everything .
then began a most entertaining chase .
this french marquise effect was her latest whim .
general opinion , however , was that she was guilty .
haydock sat down again .
two shots fired , i see , he observed , as he handed it back .
shes been going through a severe emotional crisis and she needs treating with the utmost sympathy and careor she may remain unstable for life .
my men are out hunting around in case hes been knocked on the head and his body rolled into a convenient irrigation ditch .
the trouble of it is , hes got an alibi .
in joannas eye and hastened to divert the conversation to mr .
james wouldnt know anything , said miss waterhouse scornfully .
going steady .
oh yes , i see .
it was open and inside the room was dusty and uncared for .
do stop her .
lawyers , a solicitor , i think , and another kind of lawyer with him and doctors .
the three stood together in the road , silent for the moment as they each pondered the situation .
she drank too muchno doubt about it .
im quite all right but i want an outsize band-aid or something to stick on here .
asked bill , his eyes sparkling .
no , no , i would not amuse myself in such a way .
that is what we have been toldbut actually there is evidence that she was not in her tent all the time .
is horton a cold-blooded killer ?
she said , ' oh , ' rather blankly .
they called me the pinkling for some reasoni suppose because i so often had pink evening dresses .
justice wargrave observed : a perfectly straightforward story .
have you ever thought about murder , mademoiselle ?
ive got bad news for you .
she added excitedly , wasnt i after telling you that night of the state she was in , poor dear , and the doctor doing his best to calm her down .
aristides did not) , that there would be no hostage in the usual meaning of the word , left behind .
these alkaloids are deadly and virulent poisons , and are in addition , almost untraceable .
chandra lal , said mrs .
sheit unsettles things .
there were no fancy hidden partitions or secret cubbyholes .
knighton drops off the train , taking the jewel case containing the rubies with him .
i know human nature , said miss marple .
too sharp for us .
please do not think that i am conceited enough to fancy that youthat you would ever be likely to fall in love with me .
youve come to the right place for that , said the lawyer .
funny how it was his alibi we were so careful about checking .
ship .
suggested miss livingstone .
hercule poirot , who had no wish to listen to this high-level scientific discussion , broke in .
so i did , said anthony defiantly .
these three are a bit much to take , i agree .
people called themselves hard-boiled , but they had no real idea what the term meant .
nonsense , she said robustly .
his part is the part of scapegoat ; to draw all attention from no _num_ the boss .
he wishes to benefit others .
having packed off her completed manuscript with a highly virtuous feeling , work was over .
just before i came in ?
de sousa , the murdered girl was in the boathouse this afternoon .
her pale blue intelligent eyes looked out on the world from behind strong glasses .
gerda went on rather incoherently : im so sorry , dear , its all my fault , but first , you see , i thought you were coming , and then i thought , well , if i did send it back .
i said : he is an old man .
he held out his hand with the bottle in it .
henry had the look of someone who was about to describe a treat .
come back tomorrow , but later than this .
of course , she went on , im delightedsimply delighted .
the afternoon is still young .
the woods were above and behind them , and below were the closely planted chestnut groves .
do not cling to theories where facts no longer support them .
everything that is said to them they resent .
she ensconced herself on a red velvet seat , and gazed at the turners with unseeing eyes until she saw the familiar figure enter the room .
oliver costello happened to be in this part of the world , and he just looked in to return them to henry .
and when i saw him sitting out on the balcony at the tio in the sun , i had that queer feeling youve just said of something being wrong , but not knowing what it was .
come , come , charles .
it can have no meaning whatsoever ; and yet sugden said impatiently : well , you can worry about it if you like , mr .
what was the good of a woman if she didnt look like a woman ?
india ?
you have aroused the house ?
its very kind of you to have brought this .
after booking a room for the night and signing the register , tommy observed pleasantly .
anyway , were not here very muchtoo deadly dull .
he was very tired sometimes .
of course i shall , you silly old thing .
ill come with you as far as the gate onto the golf course .
how men do stick together , went on emily looking over the telegrams .
quelle histoire , cried poirot .
upward smiled slightly .
and its not as though he could take it with him .
totman , stationer , of the high street .
and henry , of course , will give you away .
what did clarissa tell you when she got you to herself ?
will you tell m .
the painting had an old superficial smoothness .
the beauty , the wonderful immortal beauty of the house was destroyed for ever , for within its holy consecrated walls there dwelt the shadow of an unclean thing !
you dont really mean what you say , gerrard .
thats partly the trouble with philip .
and hes really a dearhes always been a dearbut he needs understanding .
that seemed conclusive enough , but yet , on examining the facts carefully , i noted two things .
well , then , inspector lejeune , why did you come ?
why , i could manage better than that myself .
but why mention it ?
but surelyive heard my aunt say as much .
johns voice sounded outside .
and yet i dont know if i ought she stopped abruptly .
ratchetts compartment in spite of the door being locked .
there were no female complications in his life , i am sure of that .
as i entered the room , mr victor astwell was coming out .
keep your teeth close together , but move your lips .
what about a drink ?
its because of you both being so celebrated .
thats ready .
joyce bored me .
easy enough to slip out of a cinema and return there unnoticed .
at that moment miss grosvenor sailed in to make mr .
oh dear , that must be years old .
edgar lawson began to shake all over .
cant you tell me at all what it is your wife is afraid of , dr .
i said to myself , a doctor has always to be studying his patientstheir expressions , their colour , how fast they breathe , any signs of restlessnessa doctor notices these things automatically almost without noticing he notices !
what he hoped to find i do not know , but he certainly did not find it .
poirot said : he was well-liked , yes ?
hannibal left tuppence and came to tommy and wagged his tail appreciatively .
he didnt want to go home he thought of its orderly perfection , its shining chintzes , its gleaming brass .
past the rose garden , and then right by the dahlia walk .
greenholtz was rustling three pound notes and searching his pockets for coin of the realm .
he couldnt understand it at all .
but i must be mistakensince you were in florence at the time .
i protest , said sir henry .
gwenda had demurred at first at choosing a house on her own .
it hurt rather at first and it ached a bit , but it doesnt now .
im afraid you must have been this time , said lejeune gently .
most dangerous .
that is fact one .
vincent was also dining with us , and during dinner he happened to mention your firm .
battle strode to the door and called the constable who was on duty in the hall .
still , we had the house , and almost at once we had a chance of selling it at quite an advantageous price .
but , said colonel pikeaway , youre a man who has always been able to find out things .
yes , monsieur , seat no .
' ' in fact , i ' m quite sure she ' s not a nice woman .
he said pleasantly : can i have your exact name and address first , please , so that we know where we are ?
he might easily have lived for twenty years .
then she slipped past him and fled headlong from the room to fall fainting into dick windyfords arms .
did you know him well in italy , my dear ?
young healthy subjectno cardiac weakness .
victoria stuck out her chin .
that looked like a plain case of suicide .
jane thinks it was very kind of you to meet her .
he could now sit back and watch the commanders mind chasing after it .
amy ?
) margaret , take henrietta hope to miss johnson .
oh no , she said .
say five hundred is your price .
sarah withdrew noiselessly , hoping he was asleep .
i began to be interested .
thats what you might call the normal pattern of female life .
died !
perhaps you will think me fanciful .
she wanted to get rid of her husband .
oh dear , said miss chadwick , i do hope there hasnt been an accident .
i was right !
her heart-shaped face , and her dancing deep grey eyes , and the brown curling mass of her hair .
in with her !
ten thousand poundswhat was that ?
my heart gave a leap as i recognized her .
a week ago the woods were magnificent .
at ashfield the whole house was crowded with oil paintings bought by my father .
also i learn that a swarthy man , a foreigner of some kind , was inquiring about the occupants of no _num_ only this morning .
loraines brows wrinkled a little in perplexity .
and then _num_ ?
did i ?
im never good at guessing , said mrs bantry .
' _num_ ' i would like your advice on that point , doctor , ' said poirot .
i think so , monsieur .
clarissa recovered herself quickly .
but why , oh why , did he not at least leave the weapon ?
what conclusions did you form , if i may ask ?
her dark hair was unstreaked with grey , and when she had a colour , as she had at this minute , the stern quality of her looks was not so apparent .
seventeen aladdins cave i the girls went up to bed that night more quietly than usual .
always just in front of him he saw the seat of those bright royal blue trousers and lucy , though scraggy enough elsewhere , goodness knows , was decidedly too broad in the beam to wear royal blue corduroy trousers .
then he said quietly , almost indifferently : your plan was differenteh ?
perfunctory as it was , though , it succeeded in its object .
there is some deep underlying compulsion .
handsome is as handsome does , said esa sharply .
not affectionjust calculation .
shows it was in her mind , eh ?
as kelsey had said every departments technique varied a little .
oh , good morning , mrs .
i say , is it really true that young st .
he got as far as attempting to do it .
theres a kind of superstition about it .
i can only tell you that to me it seems fantastic .
disgusted ?
ugly little chap , clean-shaven , glasses , and a gold tooth .
the candle was burning down .
she was a sufficiently startling figure .
as always , i said coldly , it doesnt leap to mine .
youd better lie down on my bed and have a sleep chapter thirteen hercule poirot alighted from a taxi at _num_ hickory road .
miss greer then said : well , you know it now .
look at tonight .
and the most unaccountable obstacle in the way of clear thinking and orderly progress was what he described to himself as the contradictory and impossible problem of miss sainsbury seale .
i mean , using a hatchet like that .
lawton returned , slightly more breathless than before .
please dont go and see my mother .
that , certainly .
tell him its colin lamb .
she was not listening to the conversation , she was only looking .
poirot said thoughtfully : should you say mrs .
so in a strange way it makes sometimes for such a curious simplicity that i couldnt understand it .
next i would like to see m .
jeremy spence , said hercule poirot .
he had , i was sure , first-class brains .
but if amyas or elsa die of coniine poisoning , youll be hanged by your neck !
actually , of course , he ran full speed to the rendezvous , caesars grove (which you will remember was quite nearby) , killed her and returned to the caf .
laura and julian farrar drew together as the door opened , and richard warwicks mother came in , looking very upright and self-possessed , though still walking with the aid of a cane .
my father is over indulgent where that boy is concerned .
now then , susan , said aileen .
that is to say there was a bit about the new headmistress .
if those walls could speak , i murmured .
she also drew his attention to the colour of her dress by a remark about one of the magazines .
i had just come from there .
wyatt dropped a glass of whisky he was just raising to his lips with a crash upon the floor .
she laugheda short bitter laugh .
roberts became suddenly serious .
all his life , she continued , shooting had been the thing richard liked doing best .
are there any parkinsons living here now ?
packington rose .
he must be simply furious at our having outwitted him , in spite of everything .
blore said : might as well be sure .
he wasnt anything so very much to look at , said flossie monro dreamily .
i dont really know why i came to you , said evan llewellyn .
revenge is very unsatisfactory .
but she had been staying with friends in the country and they had taken a wasps nest one day .
her mention of anonymous letters , and her insistence that she did not believe anything they said .
the goods had to be of small bulk , but thousands of pounds worth of gems and narcotics occupy a very small space .
behind those two were a couple of frenchmen , one with a beard and one much youngerperhaps his son .
her long dark lashes lay on her cheeks , her head turned naturally into the pillow .
allerton sighed .
i wonder what that word really means .
bridge is not one of the games that amuse me .
now mrs carpenter .
mud tends to stick .
the body of a young girl has been found on the beach at bexhill .
i believed him , and yet it occurred to me to wonder why , since , as he said , he liked them both , their freedom from complicity seemed to have had the result of plunging him in gloom .
is that from cassie ?
yes , a colour or colours .
' ' aha !
then my father travels a good deal .
we shall make short work of searching it .
i had one of pale green chiffon with little lace frills , and a white silk one , rather plainly made , and a rather gorgeous one of deep turquoise blue taffeta , the material for which grannie had unearthed from one of her secret remnant chests .
i always thought there was something wrong about him .
demanded colonel beck .
i came up on deck as we were approaching england .
such a variety of expressions there must have been on those faces .
miss crabtrees arrangements in regard to money had been somewhat peculiar .
ruth stared at him .
come upstairs with me and look at it .
if were on to some dope ring , theyre not the people to stick at trifles he broke off as the door opened and mr .
after all , a celebrated film star is a celebrated film star and elderly ladies , though they may be of local importance , are aware of their complete unimportance in the world of celebrities .
the key was put in the lock and turned , the door swung open .
mark it offmark it off ?
i might send her some fruit .
but she told me not to worry about the future , that she meant to help me .
a man of the criminal classes resembling mr .
what do i think ?
still he was a stranger .
another pause .
i saw in the paper two days ago that hed been made assistant commissioner of police .
he added : that is what i am seeking forand what you and your brother have helped to give mea reconstruction of the man amyas crale .
miss burgess appeared with commendable promptitude .
im so used to loading the diceif you understand what i mean .
if justice is to be done , we must know everything .
he nodded toward the table .
she said once : where are edith and josephine ?
lisa neumann went to stand by him , watching his lips , so that she could interpret what he said if necessary .
she got out of bed and put on her slippers and her warm dressing gown .
if they do not declare a general strike on the _num_ th why should they not ?
she didnt telephone .
oh , do stop straightening those damned things , poirot , hastings complained .
geoffrey raymond , mrs .
by one masterstroke the blackmailed had rid himself of the blackmailer , and at the same time had provided a victim to whom the crime would be ascribed .
the result of that is that theyve grown upwell , kind of nervy .
why not tell me if she had done so ?
boyle began molly , but stopped as that lady herself re-entered the room , knitting in hand .
well , no , perhaps notwe always knew that my mothers heart was not strong .
they will make their investigations everywhere .
he ordered tea for them both , but said not to bring it till she came .
you have not a teapot with you , i see , he said .
sheila webb said nothing .
the reason was clear .
taxine .
the doctor stared at her .
bauerstein , that strychnine , as a drug , acts quickly ?
my god , thats her fourth murder !
finally ellis departed .
he felt forlorn and very much alone .
perennas eyes flashed .
it seemed an odd juxtaposition to me .
do you know , newman , that sounded to me very like a threat , i said as we climbed the hill homewards .
poirot said quietly : he told me that it was a hysterical outburstno more !
i was really very poirot interrupted her .
as far as she could make out , she seemed to be in a kind of attic .
the circumstances in which the green pompon was found suggested at once that it had been torn from the costume of the murderer .
sir matthew was my guardian .
the smoke made a fine question mark in the sky .
she felt slightly nervous over the second resolution .
below the windows some bulbs were growing , mainly tulips .
uncle , just come and listen to this .
i saw her arrive .
miss brewster made a face .
i dont want to say anything against the dead , resumed mrs .
or else christian had been listening to juliet bellever .
against venetias code to show surprise , but she could not quite keep the undertone of it out of her voice .
well , why shouldnt she enjoy ill health if she cared to pay for it ?
caroline said : i dont believe a word of what you are saying .
just walking along the road .
roland .
chesterton , you know , the writer .
he had to wait a minute before he could force himself into the mood where he could visualize major horton as a successful murderer .
he behaves in a most forgiving , friendly manner , is often at this house , has become apparently a tame cat around the house , the faithful dobbin .
father gorman nodded and took it .
oliver turned another corner wearily and there ahead of her was the gleam of the water .
they may even enjoy anxiety .
after all , we couldnt be absolutely sure he was deadit might have been a cataleptic seizure .
it was washed , of coursebut they dont realize nowadays that a microscopic amount of blood will give a reaction with the latest reagents .
retired people usually .
hercule poirot asked : are you sure that it did come later ?
and suppose someone did succeedin snatching your husband away from you ?
there were still eight names on it .
youre very much the age i was when i started here but youve got what i no longer can have .
and in time his efforts were crowned with success .
papa looked pained .
inevitably the eyes of everyone in the shop turned towards the windows of the shop giving on bond street .
a lunatic , said bobby .
hello , marcia !
words failed madge .
the man who gave his name as m .
miss carnaby began to sniff .
julia sighed .
now what makes you say that , charles ?
' he picked up the telephone receiver and spoke througk t .
is it a long time since you saw your friend ?
i presume that winnies trunk had been unpacked on arrival ?
mind you , she spoke in confidence .
denmans room was in no way remarkable .
a schoolmistress .
really , i had blood on the brain .
well , monsieur poirot , what have you got to say to it all ?
he said you had asked him all sorts of questions , not only as to what he had eaten , but as to who prepared it and served it .
ah , said poirot , the conflicting statements !
called him old slow and sure .
perhaps because film stars and their love affairs and their devotion were so written up in the press that one never expected to see the real thing with ones own eyes .
in view of the rumours that were going about , permission must be applied for to exhume the body , and a proper post-mortem must be made and lying tongues quietened once and for all .
nurse harrison said slowly : there is somethingsomething that , i suppose , i ought to have told you beforebut i didnt think that there was really anything in it .
we worked furiously over finances .
to tell you the truth , im not nearly so keen on having adventures myself as i was .
that rather depends on whether you want to see justice done or not , mrs .
alistair blunt said : you dont mean thatthat there isnt any such person ?
are linnet doyles affairs in the perfect order they should be ?
id say that by now hes accumulated nearly as big a fortune as my grandfather left .
elinor frowned , suddenly jerked back to reality .
elvira shot a quick , uneasy look at her mother .
she asked me only for a direction .
the bomb is always going to hit the other person !
thats why it was such a shock to me to learn how far the thing had gone .
it was , he admitted , a cads trick to stay in a mans house and steal his fiance .
i think she must have taken something .
its been quite a clever system , you know , getting jewels or various things of that kind changed into packets of rough diamonds , hiding them , and then when the time comes they are flown abroad , or taken abroad in fishing boats , when all the hue and cry about one particular robbery has died down .
he turned those bewildered brown eyes on mr .
ah , but what follies it is you contemplate .
somerset house is very useful , you know , in all those things .
a lot depends .
what about a reference ?
if fenellas affairs were not , shall we say , in the healthy state they ought to be , thenyes , possibly her premature death might be , shall we say , fortunate for someone , we will name no names , someone perhaps who could cover his traces more easily if he had a fairly simple person , if i may say so , like yourself to deal with .
he had a terrific crush on elvira , she said .
pilar said , her big eyes opening very wide : but i do not feel sad at all .
behind the times , she was .
miss marple is missing _num_ .
i know you think im a bit slap-dashbut id try and take trouble with the beds and the washing-upand im getting quite a dab hand at cooking .
there was very little makeup on the face .
martin dering , formerly miss sylvia pearson .
oliver , but it didnt seem to go down very well , did it ?
roberts leaned forward , took it , and examined it with rich professional appreciation .
noyoure quite rightmore wagner .
you are , then , abandoning your practice in queen charlotte street .
who will be next ?
shed never felt better .
miss glen was sitting in the very center of a large settee upholstered in gold brocade .
butler , for which , if i remember rightly , she was highly commended and rewarded .
poirot was quietly and methodically outlining what he called the pattern .
mary restarick , with her wig of formally arranged golden hair with crimped waves , her conventional clothes , her slight colonial accent , her brisk way of talking , presented a complete contrast .
they never repeated their crimesone crime gave them what they wanted and they were content .
he looked at me with a more respectful attention than he had given me so far .
with some enjoyment he did so .
and poirot , having effectually silenced , if not convinced me , leaned back with a satisfied air .
the chief constable heaved a sigh .
she gave it to sylvia .
its a fascinating spot .
i shouldnt be connected with it in any way .
no footmarks or tyremarks were likely to show .
about those letters , sir george , began miss brewis .
this man bassington-ffrench .
but hell tell you .
faithful soul .
it was an isolated road .
you know she isnt , claudia , although you wont admit it .
i have told you everything that i know .
i just brought up some of my quinces , explained mrs .
i suppose he might have been an illegitimate child .
peter lord said violently : theres no evidence that elinor ever handled that tube !
i let her sob for some moments in silence and then i said very gently : lettice , why did you do it ?
the air of charlock bay is very bracing , i believe .
she removed her feet from the pedals and placed them in a position where she could brake with them when necessary .
henry angkatells hobby was firearms and he had quite a collection of them .
so we assume that he was actually in the neighbourhood of hazelmoor on friday .
there was a man there , hidinga dreadful-looking man , a sort of tramp .
we had met mrs park-lyle out in cairo .
as you say , it is odd .
and edward had never loved her .
and now youre blaming poor old steamroller coote .
i did earsaturday night it wasas you and your usband was some kind of relations .
there was the faintest pause , the mere hesitation of a moment , before she answered : yes , that is so .
i dont think im the kind of man to be caught napping .
it will be the birthday present i like best , she said .
she was silent , lost in admiration of that noble attitude .
well , i suppose its that im always asking , said tuppence .
this is only a crude device to prevent you getting on the track of these scoundrels .
then there was barker , one of our housemaids , who opened up to me yet another vista of life .
drive to paddington .
she said : very well .
do you think youd better upset yourself , val ?
she looked at chief-inspector davy , and it was almost a pleading glance .
i actually heard the voice in the telephone asking your wife to come round at once , and soand so i was tricked by the old simple device of the banged door .
it had seemed that morning as though things were going so well .
i stooped down and pulled out a heavy book from the bottom shelf of the bookcase in order to press the photograph flat again between its leaves .
rumours were spreading the whole timeneither of the great ones was coming !
badcock , i think .
five ?
i can dot the is and cross the ts .
curtiss up to sittaford ?
there wasnt the least possibility of a mistake .
he was hunting through isobels desk for hers when winnie danced into the room with a disreputable doll .
findeyson .
poirot is right .
you really are marvellous .
he looked bad-tempered and bitter .
i said : i canti cant and turned my face away .
i think youd better bring her out here , said tuppence .
one arm round the girl , chief-inspector davy fumbled in his pocket with the other hand .
well take the canoe , not the motorboat harry began , when suddenly he stopped dead and held up his hand .
rehearsal of what ?
and someone was following himand so , he never got to her .
dont worry , my dear , she said .
my agent got away with it just in time .
she could make very little of felicie , however .
i have a friend who works at tropical research .
no , he ran no risk of dying .
then he nodded .
then silence , broken by a voice utterly unlike that of mrs .
but , pausing a moment , he added : still , it does not surprise me .
its always worth taking a risk , isnt it ?
he spoke absently .
mcginty never spoke of being nervous of anyone , or afraid , did she ?
now what does that show ?
when did you change your mind ?
' damnation !
she didnt answer at oncethen she said , moving away : you mustnt ask me , mr .
egg felt her spirits rising as they turned and twisted through the various shortcuts which sir charless experience had discovered south of the thames .
someones at work to hush it up .
it shot ahead .
and what do we do ?
im like an old-fashioned victorian clergyman .
did she appear flurried or put out in any way ?
or is that asking too much of you ?
only what you might expect .
astwell , you once killed a man in west africa .
miss lingard thought .
plans ?
he hummed the love motif from the walkre .
you were to find it somewhere and return it to patricia .
it was a disgrace , shameful , to go to the police !
you dont think she isyou dont think shes dead ?
lane , will you tell me your own movements today ?
thyrza whipped out the glove from the machine .
and that , i hoped , would be the end of any nasty talk .
she greeted knighton with dignity and an austere politeness which would have damped many men .
i could help you , you know , he said persuasively .
i dont know , said dakin .
everything wrecked , brokenall because of a crazy infatuation for a silly woman .
in any other way , she will be all right .
any kind of problem .
i believe in being sincere and saying exactly what one thinks .
roger seemed to be asking the question of himself .
you know nothing about him .
did you take it out ?
to that you will reply yes , last month .
poirot , i have left devon for good .
' i suppose it is .
what is the motive ?
he had no doubts of what the future held for him .
that couldnt have been so .
in the midst of life we are in death , murmured her husband .
i might be helping to put the rope round the neck of an innocent man .
' ' i ttdnk everyone does nowadays .
vera whispered : so this is what they wanted them for .
for a moment or two i was tempted to run the show myself .
for the vicar .
some people , that is .
it seemed cruel to try and bring him back to the present .
and i assure you there is nothing absurd about what i am saying .
im feeling better now , he said .
you did not see me .
one fact that nobody had appreciated at the time .
it was said to me by an elderly relative of mine .
to risk your life finding out that a ridiculous story isnt ridiculous at all .
theres a kind of sympathy between us .
all the same yes , miss dove ?
so the idealists gave up their tasks with alacrity : they had never thought they would have to do anything like this , they said .
never anything suspicious of any kind ?
i cant take him to the white elephant sale .
she moved slowly across the room and opened a cupboard in a corner of the room .
cest moi .
tuppence raised her eyes , astonished .
it would hardly amount , poirot thought , to a motive for marriage .
poirot replied gravely : winnies luggage !
it was inclined to be foggy .
she was that kind of woman .
the chauffeur that brave omurphy !
a lot of it went to museums and hospitals .
holding it , loraine looked up .
at last the matter was settled , after a lot of discussion over difficult points .
once on the stage , once when i sat opposite her at a luncheon party .
to make things clear and explain the position , i have appended a rough sketch of the right-hand wing of the house .
yes , i think thats really where it all begana fantastic notion occurred to me .
one was the local inspector , the other poirot recognized as sergeant graves from warmsley vale .
it is not so , but that is what people will say .
i said that i thought there could be too much squareness and , alluding to an old joke , i asked if in this super-modern hostelry they managed to induce hens to lay square eggs .
renisenb felt pleasedwarmed .
like a flash dermot was outside the window and swinging himself down the wire rope .
she sat with her hands clasped round her knees , occasionally looking up at her fathers face .
to the left or the right ?
she was looking at poirot with faint disapproval .
parker vanished , and we repaired to the lobby outside the study door .
he once or twice observed to me that he thought dorcas must have made an error fixing the time of the quarrel .
very bad headaches .
you may as well begin serving .
yes , of courseas a matter of fact when i was here last i left a little diary behind .
i wondered who they were .
anyway , you had no feeling of having seen anyone at meadowbank whom you had seen before ?
she appealed to her hostess with a slight pout , and a tilted shoulder .
its one way of calling a goose a swan , i said dryly .
we said little and eyed each other in apprehension .
vandemeyer had poured a few drops .
you shall judge for yourself .
did the lady apply personally , or by letter ?
and tonight was the great summer festival , the festival of the full pasture .
she flushed a little and murmured rather incoherently : i think sometimes , you know , one can overdo things the other way i mean the young people with a good heredity , and brought up wisely in a good homeand with grit and pluck and the ability to get on in lifewell , they are really , when one comes down to itthe sort of people a country needs .
i say , monsieur poirot , youre not very encouraging .
race horses went lame , and stocks went down , and property depreciated .
i think that can be arranged , mr .
five peoplefive frightened people .
is it connected with the stage , may i ask ?
he got up and wandered along the beach in the opposite direction .
but the boys doing the right thingthe only thing he can do .
you satisfy me of what really happened .
if hes going to have a routine of going to the churchyard every day , it will really be very difficult for us .
and she was greedy .
her steps led her , as they did so often , to the nile .
they were for slates replaced on the roof , the mending of fences , replacement of a worn-out kitchen boilera new main water pipe .
she said : we must try and behave as usual .
miss howard has previously made up a cock-and-bull story about him and mrs .
the deformity was goneand the scar this operation had left was easily hidden by a choker of pearls or beads .
some nursemaid , said my grandmother , must have let them sit on the damp grass .
but instead of rushing out to fetch a policeman in good sound british fashion , albert had elected to play a lone hand .
what do you know of his tastes ?
ive told her he was out , but she says as how shell wait , seeing as shes come up from the country .
your unexpected appearance which upsets the murderers plans .
i think it was the french .
in these days , yes , it is .
eight girls work there .
he seemed quite healthy , she added .
i had to do something , said alicia coombe .
when poirot insisted on nicks inviting a friend , how little did he think that he was signing an unknown girls death warrant .
yes , edith pagett said northumberland .
end of april .
paravicinis voice say shrilly , i never knew the police were so fond of parlor games .
miss hinchcliffe shook her head .
not a word , unfortunately .
and youve no suspicion of your own ?
he was alivealive !
id swear to them .
as the house now was , it was difficult to get into it through the front door and one could only get access to it by ladder .
leo thinks gwenda did it , gwenda thinks leo did it .
you havent had any other sarcophagus murders , have you ?
to the inside of one of them wet sand still adhered .
i am the flail of the lord .
suppose , now , we hear what they are ?
but no hurry .
supposing that theo didnt come , that she had changed her mind ?
we do know something about what you have termed the men in her life .
george has always promised to have the stones reset for me , but its never been done .
he was inclined to believe in the supernatural for the first time , but he wasnt going to admit it .
whats it got to do with them ?
my nurse and guardian !
whittington turned to tuppence .
they came out into the churchyard and lingered .
miss lawson interrupted .
we left the main road and wound into the leafy fastnesses of the hills , till we reached a little hamlet , and an isolated white villa high on the hillside .
and it puzzled him .
it wouldnt be difficult , you know .
the doctor gave us the tip right away he and the police surgeon did the autopsy together and the result is in no doubt whatever .
there was a queer scared expression on her face .
we must do what we can .
i express it by he continued happily .
worried to death by her husbands way of life .
the front door ?
and there were three other actors .
how happy are those scenes in paris at pere lachaise , with whole families attending family tombs and making them beautiful for all souls day .
if you ask me , hes mad .
it was all incredibleso incredible that probably it would not have been believed in court .
shes a perfect terror when she likes , said maureen .
he watched her as she stood frowning a little and looking down .
i remember she had on a most sweetly pretty frock .
all went as i had planned she paused , closing her eyes a minute then opened them again .
its a wicked cruel lie .
but thats all over nowisnt it , augustus ?
she cried out .
suggestive , is it not ?
drake reflected that , all the same , it seemed a curious reason for putting off a journey home .
the postmistress very kindly said she remembered the parcel , but the address on it was not the one i was mentioning .
poirot did not reply to my questions .
imhotep struck the palm of one hand with his other hand clenched into a fist .
so you read that rag , do you ?
as she took her seat at table she remarked : the weather is changing .
the sun beat down on him .
yahmose , it is true , recovers strength now every day .
would i do anything ?
benny , i mean .
twenty-five four people sat in poirots room .
and that major palgrave was poisoned in that way ?
perhaps it was : i dont see how what she said can have been true .
he was wearing a rather bright periwinkle-blue pullover .
then with startling suddenness a mans figure loomed out of the night .
i see , said rosamund .
well , it was absolutely an accident , said jean .
tonight , and suggesting that codders should be asked over .
erwell , no , not exactly .
in five shades , ash , chestnut , titian , brown , black .
im only saying that you loved him .
oh yes , it was .
so like menquite unable to see whats going on under their eyes .
_num_ ' you see , it ia easy enough , the thief has only to watch for the right moment !
its bindley heath aerodrome .
it is 	as being rich himself- in fact i have a little 	not the same thing 	of parting with h money , 	idea that the lady is not very fotld 	except on a very good pretext .
the passport , the letter of credit and the accompanying letter of identification had been suitably dealt with .
one red dragon , she said regretfully , and i should have had a hand of three doubles .
rich people above suspicion , coming here with a good lot of luxury luggage , leaving here with a good lot of luxury luggage which looks the same but isnt .
it needs frequent adjusting and all that .
that was the clever part of it , said miss marple .
she was like somethingfrozen .
she looked up at him appealingly .
im never at a loss for a plot .
ive already fallen foul of both the loyalist and the revolutionary parties .
theres no telling with a body once its in the water .
the only one i could get hold of .
there were very few new burials in it .
superintendent harper said slowly : but in actual fact a shock didnt kill him .
she spoke more to herself than him , her shoulders drooped still more .
i cant stand this .
but come along and ill show you those footprints .
by the tiger i mean the murderer , said poirot .
i mean now that he is living in exhampton pity to break a habit , said major burnaby .
he asked medamned cheekif i was in the market too ?
it was maddening not to be able to do anything .
we have reason to believe that a special agent has been despatched from moscow to this country .
but something in his tone satisfied me .
andrew pennington , who was mrs .
a man called mackenzie , wasnt it ?
she said slowly : i see .
i wonder , madame , what were the names of the friends with whom you were staying .
i got the telephone message just now from your office saying that you were on your way here .
it seems to me that if you come to where we are going without my preparing you with explanations (which cannot in the nature of things mean anything) , your first impressions will have more force and significance .
there were stories going around about molly wanting to marry an undesirable young man , but i rather fancy that the undesirable young man was actually tim kendal himself , though that wasnt the name he was using then .
satterthwaite kindly .
the man who loved ellie wasnt really there .
not an old man of the mountain , but there might be an old woman of the mountain .
that is good news , said poirot .
ive said sharp things about her .
do you fancy that you can deceive him ?
nicoletis left the queens necklace a short while later feeling revived and positively happy .
as summerhayes was licking the stamps , she spoke .
your mother is dead , mr boynton .
but then , of course , thats what i never shall have .
karl lutz and was rebuffed .
satterthwaite , you think i killed mabelle .
i think , he said , that that wall is important .
mcginty stuck her hand out , mrs .
she was run over by one of these horrid motorcars and of course i couldnt have let wonky pooh go to strangers .
lastly , he went down to the seashore and shot himself .
' " we ' ve got him sir , " he panted .
we could weigh the pros and cons .
she lost her nerve and said it was roseshe tore open her basket and roses it wasa miracle !
but one has to think of a court of lawand the questions that would be asked .
well , said the inspector , refastening his notebook .
and fall into the ditch as a result of thinking about them , grinned battle .
and she remembered joan , her niece-in-law , raymonds wife , saying : dont get mixed up in any more murders , aunt jane .
i was simply frantic .
i knew something was going to happen , and actually they had not felt anything of the kind .
her voice sounded completely uninterested .
apparently , he and a mr .
he pushed me into a chair .
parker pyne pleasantly .
your wife never met miss french ?
exactly , hastings .
my fault , drawled the beautiful unknown .
you were very rude to people , she said to stillingfleet .
but you should really grow a moustache .
miss cole said : do tell me , what were you thinking about when i came up to you ?
what a child you are , renisenb .
letters which he was at perfect liberty to have kept once they had lost their importance .
tuppence ran to her suitcase , extracted a small red volume and returned to the table .
passage of arms _num_ .
a mere figure of speech , baron .
its like a runaway horse , said lady coote .
but what can mothers do ?
and so does the girl with the black hair .
you mustnt mind me rattling on .
i know , cried virginia suddenly .
and dont call me nanny , said the lady .
naturally , mrs warwick replied .
the time for the other will come .
ah i looked up , quick to notice the change of tone .
she was sitting right there , he said .
i was so frightened that i rang the golf club .
that will do capitally .
yes , he had dined well .
at the end of half an hour lady tressilian gave a deep sigh of satisfaction .
why could he not have spoken out boldly ?
olivera , her jaw dropping , said blankly : oh !
ackroyd possessed a large fortune ?
punctuating this were sounds .
i have boasted of my little grey cells , and now i have lost a human life , a life that came to me to be saved .
but then , everything is at sixes and sevens this morning .
well , the way were building this up , old macthingthe father of the child richard ran overis more likely to come bursting in , breathing blood and thunder and revenge , with his own weapon at the ready .
theres pams mother , said jennifer .
cocker .
or could it have been one of the students ?
i see what you mean , admitted father .
of course , hes a cautious mani suppose a harley street big bug has to be .
to my surprise , his eyes twinkled a little .
i trust you .
wrong , that is , about this part of it .
we shall know better after the autopsy , mrs .
that seemed the only fishy part to me .
i fetched some socks i had just finished darning and put them on the table in the living room for the men to sort out when they came in , and then , as there was nothing much more to do , i went up on the roof .
(why , calgary wondered , had he come so late in the day ?
the one thing necessary is for this man to be caught and punished .
van aldin at once .
the unit is quite self-containedall you want on the premises .
would you want to in my place ?
' you ' re not satisfied , m .
no , no , i had nothing to do with this business last night .
rosamund contemplated the question .
halliday before .
poirots words struck mrs .
major halliday .
i was just wondering about him .
everything went wrong for me tonight , she said .
then she wheeled up what was , in effect , a kind of canopy on wheels .
the diplomatic service , i understand ?
she might have borrowed from giselle .
youve got to go on living whether you like it or not .
she did what she was told .
anyway , its worth trying .
idiotic conversation , thought frankie , and why should it make me feel creepy , but it does !
and what minister is that ?
with your permission , i will communicate with my old friend , the prfet , at geneva .
looking down at her feet , mrs .
she had a ghastly way of tidying up everything and putting things into drawers so that you simply couldnt guess where they were .
because i havent the nerve , you mean ?
nobody seems to have heard the shot .
and his fortune passed to captain seton .
he always washe just didnt seem able to help it .
look here , josephine .
something flew past his ear .
its richard , said miss bennett , her voice strangely calm .
as the young man stood by the table , restlessly flicking over the covers of magazines , poirot looked at him sideways .
is that what youre telling me ?
if she recognised him , he may have recognised herand he may have realised that she had recognised him .
edith de haviland was a woman of about seventy .
but this time youve gone too far .
then , frankly , i thought hed tire of the part .
for a moment or two her steps slowed up , then she went rather unwillingly to the door , adjuring herself not to be so silly .
nurse hopkins spoke with authority : theres many couples that dont go to church till a bit after they should do so .
ill talk to mr .
poor old adrian .
three hercule poirot sat in nurse hopkins cottage .
do you expect to have the house for long ?
youd be surprised , said miss peake jovially .
poirot said : nurse hopkins is quite an intelligent woman within her limitations , but her intellect is hardly the equal of mine .
armstrong said warningly : hell be dangerous .
the likeness is so great .
where did you intend it to be ?
so that sets your mind at rest , doesnt it ?
rather an old fool , i believe .
i had doubts of course as to whether she would accept it or not .
nick .
there was a pause while miss peabodys memory , diving into the past , conjured up visions of dashing , bewhiskered young men .
it was all a lieeverything !
dolly , of course , is quite different .
and originality becomes eccentricity as the years go by ?
he cast an amused look in my direction .
margot got into the car , unlocked the door on the other side , and dermot craddock got in beside her .
_num_ am plane .
were those wonderful heirlooms really handed down to her ?
you know how shocked and grieved we were at the time .
oh yes , ive sold several to the young gentlemen there .
the inspector went over to confer with the constable , and clarissa continued speaking quietly to sir rowland .
yes , i think this might be useful .
life was not very easy for that mother and daughter .
perhaps it is haunted , as mrs .
suddenly she shivered and began to retrace her steps towards the others .
you have got things .
oh , god , what shall i do ?
that alters everythingeverything !
a moment later lou heard a crash of broken china , a heavy fall , and then silence .
for gods sake , loraine , whats happened ?
very nice indeed , said an approving voice .
if only it was brenda .
from all ive ever heard , potassium cyanide isnt the kind of stuff you take about with you in your waistcoat pocket .
and she enjoyedhow shall i put itshowing how sharp she could be ?
) as i have already mentioned , she had a theory that no child should be allowed to read until it was eight .
there were notices , too , on both gull cove and pixy cove by the ladder .
redfern admired your wife ?
she was fond of mary , though ?
i was thinking of when my mother died .
we know everything .
she had said to gerald once before they were married .
but why didnt you tell me now ?
again i am to bear witness to this womans existence .
i dont mind nownow that theyve taken it away .
entwhistle who was concerned , why should he come to me ?
rather washed-out looking .
he heard scraps of girlish conversation , a little laugh .
plenty of time , said mr .
he objected ?
i can imagine nothing more unlikely .
etherington leonard etherington .
it was opened promptly by a middle-aged man who fitted in quite accurately with the mental image inspector neele had formed of him over the phone .
he thought , perhaps , that it was too soon after the tragedy for everyone to forget .
he asked me to do one thing for him .
in no particular did he resemble any one of the characters which number four had previously assumed .
ive been through all that .
theres nothing there , m .
of course she was !
she nodded thoughtfully .
bishop wept .
reilly said slowly : it is just possible that mrs .
well , i just thought thatd be a very good place to hide things in .
the sensational manner of her death had aroused great public interest , and the coroners court was crowded .
she looked like its mistressthe housekeeper who was slightly blind and also deaf saw a woman who wore molly ravenscrofts clothes and the most recognizable of molly ravenscrofts wigsthe one with little curls all over the head .
she purposely waited for a lull in the conversation to say : .
if he had brought a ring , or a bracelet , however expensive , i should not have demurredi should have accepted it with eager pride and pleasurebut for some reason i revolted violently against the dressing-case .
having read about you and the clever things youve done .
well , youd know that , wouldnt you ?
i reckon it is , mr .
a sonorous gong boomed pontifically from the hall .
i had taken out what savings i had (there werent many) , and id bought her a little green shamrock ring made of some irish bog stone .
and yethow childish it all was in the past !
at the side of the main road fifteen miles from amiens .
tall and slim as a willow with delicate ankles and feet shown off by sheer silk stockings and well-cut shoes .
people drive much too fast nowadays .
in a position such as yours , it is hard indeed .
it did not occur to you for one moment that sir gervase might have shot himself ?
you are my son , micky .
they seem to be quite hopeless .
what a dispiriting interview it had been .
but if you think ive fallen for lynn marchmont , youre wrong .
you caught the girl by the shoulders and shoved her over into the stream .
he had a card case on him .
you did say sunny point , sir ?
im rather busy in the kitchen .
the fact that it was august and that the papers were hard up for subject matter would make matters worse .
had she remained a pretty , shy , ordinary girl he might never have looked at her .
the kidderminsters made a point of encouraging likely young members of the party .
his name was not tom , it was william , but the combination of tom tiddler had always been too much for his colleagues .
the motive was emotional ?
inspector neele blinked a little .
peters drew a deep breath .
if convenient to yourself he would be glad if you would call upon him at the above address at _num_ .
i did not expect them yet awhile .
and carrie louise leans on this miss bellever ?
i was searching for a knitting needle , she explained unnecessarily , brandishing her discovery as she spoke .
shaista was scornful .
personally , i dont know anyone called smith .
hes a case , really .
red-haired you used to be .
however , oh !
we must get the others .
he was in my company all friday afternoon .
the chauffeur closed the door , returned to his seat and the car purred quietly away .
ii evelyn .
the following sunday afternoon mr .
it may take a little time .
entwhistle apologetically .
renisenb slipped out again .
it doesnt seem likely , said miss wills .
good family .
i needed the money badly now , because i was in serious financial trouble again .
theyve taken him to hospital for observation .
magda leonides could spill a mouthful if she chose .
perhaps , miss marple , you may think that i should not have done so .
the old boy became pretty violent in the end .
tell him im passing on to no .
quite charming .
but , after all , she came hereto this house .
at that minute the door opened , and a tall lad of fifteen who seemed undecided as to whether he was a butler or a page boy inquired in a truly magnificent manner .
but youre a good deal better , arent you , mr .
wrist-watch which had at last replaced ap .
thats why i sent the girls off to sir james .
if you keep the old ladys last days happy and occupied , thats a better deed than many .
that is very significant .
and deserves a skunks end .
tuppence leaned back in the chair .
i think it was awfully clever of you to notice those shoes , she said suddenly .
suggested seldon .
id rather it was mademoiselle blanche , wouldnt you ?
interesting though .
im frightfully sleepy .
i dont belong .
) countess andrenyias above .
race drew a deep breath .
post office it certainly wasnt .
what was the point , do you think ?
no precise plan , but ive initiated subversive activities .
said my sister .
youve got your children .
yes , that is what i mean .
thats why i feel so ungrateful .
he added , what are you smiling about ?
nicoletis went down the front steps , out through the gate and turned to the left .
madame exe is apparently under the impression that we are charlatans .
if the marriage had turned out badly , if dmitri had been unkind to her or unfaithful to her , she would just have cut her losses and walked out on him .
one of these called , jim !
we can only take so much with us abroad , you know .
a white , staring face , hardly human .
and so will her ladyship be .
i listened to this and agreed .
her smile broadenedbecame more humorous .
never mind , my dear , said miss marple consolingly .
actually that wasnt so , and i might , therefore , have forgotten all about mr .
therefore , if anyone found a ring in their soup plate it could only have been placed there either by the person who was serving the soup (in this case geronimo) or by the person whose soup plate it was .
thats the only way to react to life .
reputed to be tightfisted in the extreme .

jeremy asked coldly as his right arm was twisted behind his back and he was marched off through the french windows .

somebody who knew he was there .
thomas remembered .
it is a flaming thinga symphony of orange and red .
i see , said poirot , and at the moment the door opened and a tall fair-haired man in a lounge suit strode into the room .

hamilton clipp was talking .

i had various means of assessing that personality .
for another , he was cruel .

its a sort of feeling in the air .
that is the whole point !
but i dont fancy conscientious dusting is her strong point .
then hers dropped .

poirot said gently : everything matters .
he was to ask any questions he wanted , go anywhere he liked .
the others were grouped together at a little distance away .
notice youve got your central heating on .
it was a ticket .
there is not the slightest proof that she was depressed or unhappy or in a state of mind likely to lead her to take her own life .
well , ill do everything i can to help you , im sure .
he had thought of herif he had thought of her at allas a little blonde secretary personastute enough to have captured a rich mans fancy .
and , now that i see what jackies really like and the lengths she is likely to go to , i feel ive had rather a lucky escape .
but she wouldnt hear of it .
ive been asking myself , you know , whether that wasnt the real reason why you were engaged for this job .
i should say you must have put on about half a stone .
i cannot speak to her now .
complimenting him on his garden , we bade him farewell .
even then , miss marple , i dont see what that leads to ?
kind of personality , said davy .
then the chimney pot that had fallen off the inn , and the smell of burning in the night which he had traced to a cinder on his hearthrug .
let us at least try to keep it simple .
three or four times a year .
please let me pour it out for you , its so difficult when youre in bed .
he moved forward as though he would have liked to strike the slim girlish figure .
the great , the wonderful , the unique , m .
no , i dont think i do .
when i was out east , i longed for home , lynn cried defensively .
and william and emily too , for that matter .
she cast a quick glance at enderby .
i found it in this house .
what is the answer ?
when i am engaged to marry anyone the fact will be announced in the newspapers .
he is here at this moment .
she stepped in after him , wavered , stood stillstanding there mute and dumb , her eyes fixed on simons face .
in _num_ a feature film version of the story was released by the cannon group , starring peter ustinov as poirot for the third time .
gerald tollington , grenadier guards , and the hon .
i myself went down to meet him .
i turned .
look , juan , she cried .
come along and see him .
you make me feel quite creepy , pender , complained sir henry .
its all gone .
in a moment she would come to ask miss marple if she could get her anything in the town .
i want to go home to our mom and our ernie .
clayton who had been completely prostrated .
is he a member of a tong , or something like that ?
mrs hill probably knew all about that .
he thought for a moment or two .
crumbling the toast on her plate , rosaleen murmured : you said wed go to americasoon .
a lot of people are doing it .
' donovan looked down at his hand in surprise .
when he looked up , he found himself alone .
what a terrible part she has had to play , poor woman .
someone who was supposed to have been in the room all the time .
a most delightful mannot at all reporterish .
i couldnt stop thinking about helen .
i crossed the room and picked up the receiver .
so i think , that in spite of mrs .
iii when it was apparent that there was going to be no answer we went and found colonel luttrell .
agatha christie the secret of chimneys .
he stared at him .
hercule poirot shook his head doubtfully .
the whole point was that she was to be the boss , but the matter needed managing tactfully .
but thats all .
poirot , madame , and this is m .
i dont let the boys dawdle .
ill be as quick as i can .
not much use clamming up about it .
all over the world a great demand for diamonds and other precious stones has arisen .
i said : i i must think it over .
miss saunders , the childrens governess , and john gardiner , my husbands secretary mrs .
at last he roused himself with a start and began to walk in the same direction as eastney .
i thought she was unjust to the room .
by the way , madam , i wonder if i could speak to you for a moment .
something had evidently alarmed him and he had fled without taking anything .
quite so , sir , said inspector narracott soothingly .
but why should carlotta adams wish to kill lord edgware ?
he was handling a grey squirrel coat .
how did you come to be in milton st .
i added , would you rather i left you before you got back into the town ?
if we dont do it we shall always be mad with ourselves .
walking through that garden now , youd never think that the place had once been an air raid shelter and that there was a chamber underneath .
now about margot .
you and my father and iwe three together .
the good gentleman hands you a bag of imitation diamonds andclears out with his pal .
coo , i said , whats this ?
but as far as it goes its all right .
naturally , but with the resources you have at your disposal , it will be possible for you , i think , to get that evidence .
been in a fair way to making rather a fool of himself over her until that startling , that incredible day .
the encounter had done me worlds of good .
one so often has to do thatabout everything .
because , you see , i dont really think so .
she looked round her , then bent forward , lowering her voice .
well , i said , whats the matter ?
do you really want to marry me ?
luke shook his head solemnly and murmured : very truevery true .
satterthwaite adjusted his opera glasses , looked round the house , marked down his prey and sallied forth with a well mapped out plan of campaign ahead of him .
hmi see .
you were just as i remembered you , and you were just as i want you .
slow in his mental processes .
oh no , you neednt do the traffic at all to begin with .
some things , he guessed , major porter would cling to until the end .
a scoop for anne , indeed !
then he looked at his watch and murmured : i must go along to the house .
lynn smiled at her auntthen sat silent with the refrain of the words david had spoken swimming in her brain .
vandemeyers face .
you had just recovered from a dastardly attempt to poison you miss gilchrist here sighed and said she simply couldnt understand it .
sir henry reflected .
it means that i have nothing to say on that subject .
albert then came from the back premises and bowed to greet her .
there were fusses over partsthere was rivalry from other womenthere was a good deal , shall we say , of general envy , hatred , malice , and all uncharitableness !
witch without broomstick _num_ .
two of them i already knew .
all women who have grown old and ugly .
he assumed the air of a strong man betrayed by a single weakness .
he clapped his hand to his left arm .
hercule poirot made her a little bow .
there had been three letters in that drawer , letters written by vivian dubois to adele fortescue .
roddy answered in his precise voice : i should say she was deeply attached to me , but certainly not passionately in love with me .
clarissa exclaimed delightedly .
it must have been nice when there were gold sovereigns .
i was indeed !
the conversation thereafter was gastronomic .
' one must remember la politique .
if so , he knows nothing at all about the mrs .
got the new girl there ?
i had been oblivious of my surroundings because i had been wondering how to frame my question .
you have the letters with you ?
honolulu , i breathed .
ut it .
he had a look .
tommy looked .
a new note crept into his voice .
your uncle was really a very simple man .
she thought it out so that it would meet the case exactly , but it wasnt true .
you knew i was there ?
miss lemon reminded him of two appointments which he already had , but agreed that that left plenty of hours vacant and she would arrange something as he wished .
as far as i can make out , they were very popular .
was quite a beauty onceartists used to paint her .
no idea youd been living among us incognito , m .
what , back into the past again ?
she had moved a yard or two away and was facing him , revolver in hand .
i did not speak .
im quite happy .
just sent off the moneyin one pound notes as stipulatedto the address given .
i dont remember now , said hester sulkily .
tom betterton refused .
ii jason rudd was nervous , irritable .
good morning , major burnaby .
he brought down virginia from the topmost storey in his arms .
have you any clue to where the boy has 	been taken ?
the butler and the parlourmaid both seem nervous .
i feel it makes a difference , said mrs .
did any japanese people ever live here ?
an unexpected dnouement _num_ .
i beg your pardon , my lord ?
bobby sprang up to follow her , but frankie pushed him firmly back .
but the word unusual , and her recollection of miss marples personality , carried the day and she rang up miss marple straight away explaining that she could not come down to st .
i dont quite know , he confessed .
one of them , a black patent leather , seemed to be resting at an extraordinary angle , almost unsupported .
it soon will if no one is here .
its as thoughisnt it just the right place for us ?
i didnt realise that id miss what i might call the human element so much .
ive told you exactly what i want you to find out .
i worked myself up to be more and more distressed .
yes , your plan .
this small greenhouse , called , i dont know why , k .
she was devoted to rosemary .
you could bounce them and they wouldnt come to any harm .
he wondered if he would learn anything at that address .
miss williams gave a terrific snort .
hardcastle roused himself .
the assistant remarked that the wind was very cold today , as she wrapped up the parcel .
louis , three ladies were sitting , each engaged in her particular occupation .
i always have been , whatever people choose to say .
she thanked miss knight politely .
he was sure , had been sure all along , of the sympathy of his audience .
ill just fetch another cup .
' my friend was in a placid mood .
nobody can be sure .
i found it just nowwhere i looked for itin m .
dont speak so ghoulishly , said mrs .
huish looked down at the pad in front of him .
this was one of them .
and the other couple ?
i believe it was in the middle of the morning and i shouldnt have been there .
it had all been rather a scandal .
i shall wire him tomorrow to arrange everything .
continued lady westholme .
poirot came to his last point .
you know ?
out with it , my lad , said grange .
and the girl had nothing but the tea and the sandwiches ?
she came across to him and put a glossy print into his hand .
and how bravely he speaks !
price ridley plunged into a full-swing narrative .
suddenly , he gave a faint exclamation .
johnson to remove mrs .
today was the _num_ th of october .
and beside her handjust fallen from itis her own pistol .
he thought again of james bentley , his gentle defeated voice , his lifeless apathy .
you recognized it .
my informant said he didnt wonder .
im sure he didnt , said bobby .
stow it , said number fourteen .
dont worry , uncle timothy , the spode is yours .
see here : on wednesday evening , simpson decoys away the cook .
nothing behind it ?
she tugged tommys hair out by the roots .
why , in rome , i remember they called us at _num_ : _num_ .
well , you know , old protheroe had his knife into archer pretty badly .
does nobody know ?
will my daughters presence be required at the inquest ?
very pleasant young fellow .
i have my own tea things and everything in the cupboard up there .
i can assure you that i have nothing to fear , madame .

the manuscript lay neatly piled on a chair beside him .
the restaurants varied slightly in price though neither of them was inexpensive .
hes chasing someone down the hill .
there is always a moment !
and you were with him in herzoslovakia just before the assassination of the late king and queen .
sure in your own mind ?
the questions they asked .
midge nodded .
weather good and all that ?
ive learnt to enjoyto enjoy killing people .
it appals you ?
never do they bolt these doors in the daytime .
he wore stained corduroy trousers loosely held up by an aged belt , and an open-necked shirt of very bright blue .
jefferson wasted no time in beating about the bush .
been playing golf ?
and there was a pleasant word associated with it .
redfern were the only ones this morning , i think .
she had been with that godmother of yours for years .
made a lot of money , he shifted his aged form in his chair and peered under bushy eyebrows at inspector craddock .
hilary looked round her .
strictly speaking , said miss marple , i havent begun yet .
its probably a gang .
well , we must go and catch our train , he said .
the tea was strong and to poirot singularly unpalatable .
the place being sold up after it had been in the family for three hundred years ?
said miss zielinsky nodding towards the fireplace .
when was it discovered ?
hes got a girl therenice young ladyhes engaged to be married to her .
he remarked : you wear your earrings even when you bathe .
joan is rather a silly little thing .
colonel called it .
it is vital that , as you sayall the cards should be on the tablethere must be nothing kept back .
she has no tactno tact whatever , and it is trying for a man to find his wife completely dominated by a bossy woman .
besides , he usually went to bed early and in the evening hours of steel bands and dancing , esther walters might easily havemiss marple paused to select a word in her mind , at the same time conversing cheerfully about her visit to jamestownah yes , blossomed .
the constraint was more evident .
then she told me that i was her niece , and that i was to call her aunt rita .
show her up , said mr .
but i speak now especially of photographs .
it would sound fantastic .
i was feeling a little shy at the prospect of meeting his people for the first time .
race glanced at his watch .
tall , erect , broad-shouldered , it was less the regularity of his features than the roguish and daredevil spark in his eye which made him so irresistible to the fair sex .
pleased as punch he was with it , and he said to my mother , now , mary , you bring me your jewels in their case every night and i will lock them away for you .
i suppose they will , said bunch .
at least there you are .
but he did not .
sheila swallowed mechanicallyher throat was dry .
and then suddenly he stood still , frozen with terror .
poirot , these arent my glasses .
well , well , said colin .
belcher , of course , was in a towering rage .
he paused for a moment outside on the landing .
now , now , major summerhayes , take it easytake it easy summerhayes recovered himself , shrugged , said : sorry .
following out a train of thought of her own , she murmured , and yet she is not really bad-looking .
i came back and took a chair and faced mr .
wherefore this gloom ?
mcgillicuddy nodded gratefully .
my fathers murderer must be f-f-found .
oliver told you , is her goddaughter , andwell , of course one never knows .
i didnt mean i was going to stick him in the back with a knife , though id offer my best thanks to anyone else who did so .
i dont suppose he meant to kill her .
and then we went to the front door and luckily there was reed (our constable) just passing on his beat , and we called to him .
the place has gotquite a reputation .
quite straight and aboveboard .
yes , they look for these thingsand sometimes they find them .
i have to look at the case as it will be presented by the other side .
gladys rose to her feet , panting a little .
you went to him for information , did you ?
he went on : look here , think of it this way , supposing you saw something through aa keyhole keyholes made me think of poirot !
i looked at my watch and found i was a minute slow .
on the whole i think shes accepted the position very well considering how fond she was ofof audrey .
i must hang on to that , not let this girl with her irish voice bewitch me into thinking its the tragedy of a hero and a martyr !
the cloak with the hood and the wide-brimmed hat were , victoria remembered now , a deliberate fashion of his own choosing .
i spoke up , i did , and told sir george how id seen the sign beforehand , but he didnt seem to think much of it .
she meant exactly what she had said .
richard was always plausible .
that was very thoughtful of you , said the old lady .
it wouldnt be any use if i did .
he retired early and i followed his example .
no other possibility ?
it was only yesterday afternoon that we learnt about them from m .
a fingerprint now , or a footprint , or seen in the vicinity about the time of the crime .
there is a later will .
when they came to mention the object of their visit colonel johnson was only too ready to tell them all he could .
i have hoped that the infatuation would run its course .
the table started rocking violently .
you are of too trustful a nature , my friend .
it may be that we have there the solution .
i think so , too i can think of all sorts of solutionsbut most of them are very far-fetched .
can you remember what the words you heard were ?
temperamentally unsuited .
yes , i know , but is he a murderer ?
harter looked worried .
im sorry she was rude to your wife .
did he read much ?
in lola brewsters suite lola went out of her way to welcome him effusively .
i think thats going a bit far , m .
inspector kelsey thought that he understood what miss bulstrode had meant .
the thing people dont seem to want anywhere , nowadays , said bob , is anyone whos got a bit of common sense .
names from the past but names , naturally , that dont mean anything to me .
monsieur hercule poirot .
dont waffle .
they all have their place .
thats quite true , she said .
johnson or mrs .
its crazyeverythings crazy .
and i never thought of poor mrs .
i mean what i say , said roger , interrupting nicholson as he was about to reply .
all round the walls were curtained recesses where glimpses could be obtained of recumbent women supine under the ministrant hands of pink robed priestesses .
wellim glad youre back .
he wants money for his experiments .
but you shall pay for itoh , yes , you shall pay for it !
might have committed ?
victoria beamed with delight .
we would go ashore and the captain would explain that he would blow the funnel half an hour before he was due to depart again .
on her marriage , she assumed control of her own fortune .
she cheered up a little as miss livingstone went out of the room .
im twenty-one and earning my own living , and how i spend my time is entirely my own business .
womennoisy , vociferous women !
then she said : of course im all right .
they were men that both tommy and the commander knew slightly .
whoever it was must have taken the most stupendous chances .
that looks , doesnt it , as though father didnt really think murder was very wrongnot always , that is .
by the time i was thirteen or fourteen i felt myself enormously advanced in age and experience .
listen , josephine , i dare say youre extremely clever josephine looked gratified .
sooner or later mrs boynton takes a dose and diesand even if the digitalis is discovered in the bottle it may be set down as a mistake of the chemist who made it up .
first her friends in northumberland and now her vicars wifes boys club annual outing .
the subject became quite an obsession with him .
however , esther added , i dont think molly has really anything to worry about in this case .
he started to follow gwenda along the terrace .
he watches rich go out , then he gains admission , is left alone to write a note , quickly bores those holes and hides inside the chest .
what were mines like ?
her heart gave a leap , and then stood still .
when her eyes opened it seemed to her that a long time had passed .
carter , she showed them into a small study on the ground floor , where she left them .
come and tell us himself , indeed !
all the time nothing but vegetable fats .
im afraid , you know , one does tend to get forgetful as time goes on .
but ill not leave her dead with no one to watch by her .
mabelle sainsbury seale came , quite unsuspecting .
where two lovers died and i dont blame him for what he did .
he is prepared toerdo some dirty work for us in return for a small consideration .
she greeted us with a dazzling smile .
all the same , so that my testimony may be the more valuable , i took the liberty of bringing this with me .
we stared at one another blankly .
surelysurely this could not be a second coincidence ?
he might have changed his mind .
all this was eminently satisfactory , it was an unbelievable piece of luck ; but he was puzzled .
what on earths he doing here ?
its not always a materialistic answer either .
and you havent got any enemies that you know of ?
i thought you were just saying it for the sake of saying something , i confessed .
elsie green was her cousin .
its very kind of you , said miss marple gratefully .
dr bryant , said poirot , bowing .
i dont think anyone wants thisand it might be rather fun .
shed got awell , an eye for any nice-looking man whod pass the time of day with her .
in any particular line ?
i am much obliged to you for answering my questions so promptly .
eastney seemed anxious to talk .
and she said , no , i want to look at it now .
you see , we are very booked up at this time of year and i had someone else coming into his room .
' ' positively triumphant ?
your travel life has the essence of a dream .
quite some time ago .
right , said the ambassador , and the initials of your other name ?
you here ?
all the crales were egoists .
he noted that most of the upper windows were still curtained .
it was half past seven .
there again you may have a pattern .
he has been stabbed to the heart , as you see .
and she thought suddenly : the teathere was something in the tea .
dear me , i murmured , so that is the explanation of your extraordinary behaviour .
personally , of course , i love itthe snow and the tors and the wildness of it all .
a few minutes later saw us retracing our steps to the village .
indeed it has .
fortescue , and how well do you know the affairs of his firm ?
for emily arundell was well over seventy , the last of a family of five , and she had been known to be in delicate health for many years and had indeed nearly died of a similar attack to the one that killed her some eighteen months before .
i knocked again a little louder .
poirot , arent friendly .
it must have been , i see now , a terrible thing for my poor grandmother , by then , i suppose , well over eighty , to uproot herself from a house where she had lived for thirty or forty years , having gone there only a short time after her widowhood .
i mean , one hasnt got to get up a ladder and take things down .
it took mrs .
if theres anything in this theory at all , it means that last fridays business wasnt a mere joke , and wasnt an ordinary hold-up , it was a cold-blooded attempt at murder .
i think , he said thoughtfully , that i shall be thorndyke today .
can he speak ?
forty-eight , forty-nine , fifty .
there are certain ideas as to that .
is it a party then , that you want all these things ?
' ' i don ' t understand .
almost alarming perhaps .
im not a narrow-minded woman , colonel weston , and it isnt that i disapprove of the stage as suchwhy , quite a lot of my best friends are actressesbut ive said to mr .
the good lady was instantly sympathetic .
but do not despair .
i cannot catch the words .
said adam , as kelsey took her away .
mon cher collgue , it is possiblei say no morepossible that your optimism is justified .
very wise , dear , said miss marple .
she sniffed .
roberts .
so noiseless indeed was the room that a little mouse ran across the floorand in an instant the thing happened .
they heard the sound of two bolts being shot and the turning of two keys .
dont do that , she gasped .
yes , rope .
you came here to inquire into the circumstances of my sons death ?
it would have been wonderful , said eileen rich .
rosamund said : its no use , ken !
dr stillingfleet said , it isnt the people who threaten to commit suicide who usually do it , you know , miss farley .
well , thats got to be our job .
bridget shivered and murmured : all those years agoall those years .
mathematics .
at sloane square he got out , so did mrs .
i shall go up to bed .
marlene made no response .
the police have all the means at their disposal for that kind of inquiry .
but that smellthat smell of the beach at st .
i murmured to poirot .
always putting it off .
constances brother bill , robin and i made the expedition .
mirelle reappeared , wrapped in a sand-coloured velvet wrap trimmed with leopard skin .
just so , said tommy .
of latimer ?
its no good worrying anymore , thought victoria .
your help has been of the most invaluable .
everything according to cockerbut for one circumstance .
he said : elsa ?
we were down at easter and again the weekend afterthat is right .
quite likeable .
she was afraid of our suspecting him .
nobody ever knew .
isaac could have told you a lot , though .
lemoine advancing to meet the english detective , and gathered that it was a signal from him which had attracted battles attention .
if it were me i should rejoice , i should be proud .
i was silent for a moment or two , then i had one more try .
permit me to give you a light for your cigarette .
the word bouquet reminded dr .
you are doubtless wise .
he had a watch and a wallet and a railway ticket in the pockets , said bunch .
brown the voice stopped .
now then , he said , are you ready ?
i thought i heard you come in when i was up in the nursery trying to quiet colin , who was playing up , but you werent about when i came down so i thought youd gone to bed .
mary , mrs .
he had the slightly harassed look of a man whose womenfolk have been too much for him .
her affection for him was constant and unvarying .
here the car stopped in front of the green door of the villa .
they wore some kind of uniform .
helga needheim said scornfully : there is no room here for women who are weaklings .
it was the jungle .
it was really the gunman .
but the point is , miss dawes , that , as far as miss meredith knew , you were the only person who could give us a clue to that incident .
that seemed to end that part of the conversation .
hubbards to a soothing ten per cent of the conductors .
they fall in love with bad lots .
was it a trap ?
we have several people here who have fancies .
he was staying at bertrams ; and had reserved his room for four days .
and madame kettering objected ?
it seems to me unlikely oh , please , m .
protheroe is the kind of man who enjoys making a fuss on every conceivable occasion .
snow , said poirot thoughtfully .
it was my fancy at the time , sir , that mr .
it would be as well , perhaps , though madame has already identified it .
virginia looked at him in astonishment , but some impulse quelled the retort that sprang to her lips .
whose dress , do you think ?
such a possibility would simply not occur to her mind .
i meant real work , said mrs .
the whole to be tied up with a large blue bow .
and when she is here we can proceed to our businessto lay the ghosts .
she says not .
they get , perhaps , to the end of a person .
races tone was curt .
she said , all right .
i dont think she ever saw herself seriously as a writer , she would probably have preferred to be a painter .
and then as we walked along together she said : ill tell you , jennifer .
say , in the last six months ?
right you are , agreed bill .
what had become of the revolver ?
the towers , she said thoughtfully .
his manner had certainly changed , ever so slightly , at the idea of paying her a salary .
the second crime , the crime that had succeeded , was donaldsons more scientific masterpiece .
if it should come open now and even as she spoke the impossible happened .
perhaps it was waiting for some unexpected witness .
all young , all believing in their destiny as supermen .
poirot beamed at richard encouragingly .
no stewardess on at night , miss .
everyone is always acting on behalf of someone else who cant be named or spoken of !
there , there , ne vous impatientez pas !
im sorry that there was no one to meet you in cairo .
and what is more , i tell you there will be no credit .
roly and i have got a bet on .
disputes about it were full and colourful , and sometimes heated .
that sounds very possible , said miss gorringe .
they rang off before any additional information could be obtained .
your friends , said hercule poirot , are working very hard .
either she is speaking the truthor else shes a deep one .
we really cant even afford this .
fifteen i three people sat eating breakfast in the kitchen .
no , he was staying at a hoteli believe it was that one you mentioned just now , father , bertrams , isnt it ?
it was answered by a thin , grey-haired woman who told him that colonel and mrs .
haydock was frightened too .
that isthat must be the starting point .
he looked straight into the wide , beautiful grey eyes .
madame , would it not be better if i should draw the chain across the door ?
yes , much the best thing she could do .
her whole body seemed to droop as she repeated the words .
i have diagnosed this case of mine as a case of murder .
nevile strange go downstairs and out , and she finds lady tressilian alive and well .
and sir clauds coffee was taken to him in the study ?
you ask whether i am going to tell you anything .
/ , , resented her to us .
probably giselle ruined the girls lover , who killed himself .
he kicked it again .
perhaps it was aime griffith , not that other girl ?
any special trouble ?
miss griffith declared sharply : at best , its woolgathering .
a pity that she had to make her dbut as isolde .
no , only for about a year .
very vexing when that happens .
she waswell , put it crudelyshe was too good for me ; but she still wasnt good enough for a real gentleman like mr .
it was all right , and then suddenlyall the pages were rather queer because i mean a lot of the words had been underlined in red ink .
not a bad thing sometimes .
my share of my fathers estate is mine absolutely .
i didnt want to say it , janei knew it would hurt you .
i can tell you that .
evans was a little confused , feeling that his exclamation had been wanting in tact .
that haymes woman ?
you hear something perhapsand you know well enough that your doom is sealed .
then she had sold the business at a handsome price and embarked upon matrimony for the second timewith mr .
dont get so strung up , my dear fellow .
' what ' s the matter now ?
neither wise nor grateful to listen assentingly to such words .
we go to call upon the home secretary .
very important businesswith you .
renauld held them out to him .
she was mixed up in some ira activities , nothing more , said mr .
well , we get nothing of interest there , mon ami , said poirot as we left the house .
and now you have come to london to see mr .
touched in the head himself , i mean ?
you went to see him ?
he has passed the real ones to a confederateone of the aforementioned worthy citizens .
he had to take those pills all the time to keep his blood pressure down .
henet shook her head and clicked her tongue .
its her whole life .
she said it was .
think how desperately , violently unhappy anyone must be to sit down and write these things .
what do you advise next ?
but surely its quite impossible that i should come to england and actually buy the identical house id lived in long ago ?
i will go to this manthis ogre , this monster !
i hate a one-sided show , so i promptly butted in and proceeded to beat up the toughs .
i gave them to the conductor on the french train , sir ; he said it was usual .
thesiger , for he certainly had no suspicions of him at that moment .
the strange tale he had been listening to was fantastic enough in all truth .
waverly , tredwell , and some friend of waverly .
i suppose youre hinting that shes been murdered now and that well find her in a quarry , cut up in little pieces like mrs .
kameni checked his singing and showed a proper mourning face .
the wife is calm with a quality of deep intensity .
he heard a shot , he found doyle with a red-stained handkerchief clasped to his leg .
could that be cherubic , pink gerry wade ?
he said : damned interferenceall this damned interference .
she uttered a long hoarse sentence that none of them understood .
why dont i see it or hear it ?
across a room he fell in love .
but would knowledge be enough ?
ive got to be going .
poirot was in his cabin and heard the husbands slightly guilty knock on his cabin door .
drank port all his lifeso did my grandfather .
he began walking up and down the room , as was his custom when something was worrying him .
he was a marvellous skater .
it was a good-sized piece of furniture standing against the wall next to the phonograph cabinet .
remember the medium .
you were saying , m .
and not half a bad idea either .
i have discovered that .
and you have not , perhaps , been married very long ?
he paused and went on : would you say that miss greenshaw , in your opinion , was a practical joker ?
i hardly think it matters .
yes , he would go down to lytchett st .
any man who deals in the worlds finance in a big way is liable to that kind of attention from some crazy fanatic !
now hes so changed i dont know him .
is it mary gerrard youre meaning ?
rose bent her head slowly and reluctantly .
and i thinki am surethat miss bowers stayed with her all night .
nothing of the sort !
clarice thought , how she adores him .
yours respectfully , lily kimble .
things are rather interesting when you do them for the first time .
and yet could not exactly say why ?
scrambled this morning , mrs .
he was determined to be revenged on colonel protheroe .
heather badcock had died as a result of four grains of hy-ethyl-dexyl-barbo-quinde-lorytate , or , let us be frank , some such name .
you and your meddlesome marples .
lord went downstairs , ready to receive the niece and nephew who , his watch told him , were due to arrive at any minute now .
how are you going to keep the game up ?
gerry wade was at the foreign office .
my fee , said mr .
he said it was when one of the funniest scatterbrained old pussies hed ever met came marching into his bedroom out in the west indies , with a fluffy pink scarf round her neck , telling him he was to get up and do something to prevent a murder .
you shall know all that i know , but i would prefer that you should come at the truth by your own effortsnot by my leading you by the hand .
children dancing , perhaps .
thats a very good deduction .
id answer yes to that .
he tapped the family portrait on the wall with his fingernail .
i entered my name for various sports .
come , dolly , protested her husband .
but it is not that , you know .
she had come rushing into the room , thoroughly businesslike and efficient .
clapperton unlocked the door and let the murderer in .
no , im not calling her .
and you may say what you like , it isnt natural for a man to hear that his wife is dead and display no emotion whatever .
i dont believe hes ever committed murder .
are you really going to vienna next month ?
i was poor enoughand i got out of it .
what amazing luck that window cleaner happened to be there , she said .
you really think you will find them ?
i was sicksickat heart and then suddenly the master reappeared , tall and stately in his silken robes .
no , said egg .
lord says you may live for years .
on the face of it , it seems oddso purposeless for a newly married man , young , rich , happy , celebrating his homecomingcuriousbut i agree there is no getting away from the facts .
hallo .
the death of louise .
jane said , yes , they smell so nice .
and instead there was just herself , molly davis , playing a role that did not yet seem a very natural role to play .
actually laurence has a lot of sex appeal .
vincent , he said .
lord , no .
certainly notno , i cant see any sense in that .
people dont , you know .
i suppose it might be .
she said doubtfully : i see what you mean .
so he went happily ahead with his plans for denouncing me .
mcgillicuddy , have only just returned from abroadthe day before yesterday , she added .
it sounds most interesting , said poirot .
fat or thin , i wonder ?
i got a dreadful one .
oh no , no , of course i didnt mean that at all , vicar .
and then she said something that frightened him .
i left it here the other day .
we canbut it takes time .
quite unpleasant , then .
lancelot fortescue abroad ?
it reminded him of an interior by some dutch master .
presumably the gipsy woman .
yes , but they didnt succeed .
for the first time he seemed to waver .
there was a tap , tap , tap on the window .
rupert departed hurriedly , in fear of being late at the office .
i will look roundperhaps they are not here yet .
but a girl could hide anything in the toe of a gym shoe , or wrapped up in an old pullover or in a scarf .
like an empty house at the theatre , she added thoughtfully , with people spaced out by the box office as tactfully as possible to make them look like an audience .
funny , he said .
ill stand the expense .
there are no cupboards or corners .
luke gathered the implications of this somewhat confused speech .
that should please you .
maud , who was rearranging a piece of holly , greeted him coldly .
she was a little scared of what shed done , maybe , but shed no call to be frightened of you , my boy .
is it true as theres an ideous poisoner at work ?
well , it so often happens , said miss marple .
these seven persons that i was considering fell easily into two categories .
the truths always the truth .
looking rather like a deputation , the four of us were ushered in .
tina stopped to speak to hester , then went on to join miss lindstrom and together they found philip dead .
i happened to have my own key of no .
but alas !
no , indeed , said miss marple .
but i have no real status .
they come in and out through all the windowslike in a pantomime .
id like these , please , said tuppence .
remember that no scruples will stand in dear ewans way .
vera said impatiently : nonsense !
he wired out to his first wifes people in new zealand asking them to take the child .
it wont take a minute just to slip on outdoor shoes .
cousin ewan was fortunately able to speak just before he died , said fenella .
in that case orourke will have it .
there was a small clean caf , empty except for a young couple in a corner .
illill run up and see .
devoted nephew will inheritbut is there anything to inherit ?
but it was quite strong and i sat up sniffing and sniffing , and then i saw her in the glass saw her ?
ino , i wasnt .
sir oswald played bridge , like he did everything else , extremely well , and liked a partner to correspond .
there was bitterness in her voice and a weariness that revealed her _num_ years .
poirot looked at him reproachfully and said , ahem !
i didnt care a damn for the womanrather disliked her , as a matter of fact .
she looked at us both , nodded her head vigorously , and withdrew satisfied with the effect she had produced .
she sat down suddenly on an upturned packing-case .
molly stared at the object he held .
i thought that perhaps it was a warning not to be too outspoken in front of the inspector .
always , at the back of her mind , she had felt sure of living there permanently some day .
but it seemed to her , reluctantly , that once confronted with betterton , there could be no way out .
the comte took this out and weighed it in his hand carefully for a minute or two .
he came in eagerlyand rather clumsilyhe stumbled over a chair .
turning with a final spurt into elvaston square , he drew up with a terrific jerk in front of the house .
i am always watchingalways hoping i shall be proved wrong .
the doctors gaze went to sylvia .
do you mean he saw you ?
do you remember that sacr pig of a horse that let us all down at auteuil ?
the tortoise , mon pre , overtook the hare .
the field marshal was immediately deflated and became cooperative .
now nora , that was only about seven or eight years ago .
cette petite , she would never bother her head about a thing like that .
people are so selfish , piped a girls voice .
i gathered that major phillpot was god locally .
go on working on this line of yours .
perhaps , leo thought , they had been too soft with him .
oh , reallyi dont knowi mean i dont quite see i will show you , said poirot , cutting in upon these doubts in an authoritative manner .
now , in his own good time , he was willing to elaborate the theme of the crale family .
it wouldnt matter , said mr .
i expect hes come about the will .
little miss meredith didnt .
he led me down a path to the left enclosed in yew hedges .
they laughed .
the low beetling brows , and the criminal jaw , the bestiality of the whole countenance were new to the young man , though he was of a type that scotland yard would have recognized at a glance .
i know she did , from lots of things she said .
there was a resemblance , a very close resemblance , but it was not the same man .
i myself , last nightbut we will not speak of that now .
stillingfleet insists on speaking to you at once .
leach nodded .
she spoke to argyle .
and i dont know what to do .
cried jackie .
think mademoiselle .
its defeating the ends of justice .
shall press you in .
for heavens sake dont look so pleased by the idea , victoria !
his clothes wont fit you too badly .
i arrived on tuesday , the _num_ thnot wednesday , the _num_ th .
you dont seem to mind at all , said sybil .
a great deal sometimes .
no , he was afraid there wasnt much doubt as to mrs .
' between five and ' ten minutes , i should say .
she was tactful and full of common sense and besides she looks so nice .
youve had previous experience ?
poirot looked after them , and then assumed a puzzled expression as he turned to look again at the body of the man who had called him away from london with such urgency in his voice .
leidner did not leave the roof .
i wondered just what was passing in her mind .
just answer something ; that is all they need .
my familys business is my business .
his brow furrowed itself in thought .
certainly not if they think i took it .
barling started and flushed .
two were travelling together .
the newspaper dress is easily put on over that of an executioner .
there were things to prepare for supper .
what matchmakers you women always are !
the whole world was growing bigger .
some of the statements are capable of proof or disproofbut it would be difficult to do so without showing ones hand pretty plainly .
but its for us to get busy and do something .
let me see , said rhoda .
quiet now , quiet , clarissa murmured soothingly .
poirots voice arrested her .
anyway , the fat was in the fire as far as the doctor was concerned .
no other shot had been fired .
tanios says that charles and theresa are rotten to the core , and he hints that their mother was a murderess and says apparently carelessly that theresa is capable of murdering anyone in cold blood .
i shoved the necklace and the notice where to pick me up in the pocket of the car in passing .
the man who owns those nasty little weekly papers ?
if she took off her european shoes and stockings and shuffled along with bare feet , she might possibly evade detection .
dinah said , bewildered : i dont understand .
she was a very ill woman .
it would be interesting to see who bought the towers .
you didnt leave the room at all until then ?
just what i was going to ask you to do .
whos dear jean been poisoning your mind against ?
he must have had a curious characterto turn his car before going to the rescue .
weve got to go in .
he leaned forward , his long arms hanging down between his knees .
badly topped , it scudded along the ground and embedded itself firmly in the bunker !
almost like spring instead of winter .
you and miss linda marshall ?
hence his delight at poirots presence in the neighbourhood .
situated modestly in the vicinity of shepherd market , it was discreet , expensive and inconspicuous .
shes an attractive young woman , said superintendent huish .
this is a report from one of our reconnaissance pilots .
i didnt go on living here .
cried no _num_ .
on his knee was a letter from mr .
rosamund turned her head and stared at him .
but there is no third way .
the man smiled .
why , is one of the windows open ?
i have no doubt that the nurse-companion talked , that the servants talked , that everyone talked !
but we have no wide-open spaces in england .
one certainly hopes not , said hercule poirot .
his colleagues had , in his opinion , made up their minds beforehand what their findings were going to be .
but the last thing i want to do is to offend you by seeking for information which is no business of mine to know .
' there is one thing 	you do not know !
it reminds me very much of the things a friend of mine used to tell me .
just a bit of fun among friends .
ithings are very difficultyou see , gordons death has made a great difference to us all .
and today was friday , and the clock on the mantelpiece showed the hour to be _num_ : _num_ .
he held up his hand to bar our way .
those arent pebbles , my dear girl , theyre diamonds .
it will haunt me for ever !
i may think she had a certain ideabut you see i might be entirely wrong .
i had to pull up .
not all at once , she said .
i think he thought she could give me certain information .
spragge , smiling and shaking his head .
we thought wed well , lay on a murder for you .
she wasnt there , said clotilde .
brooding over his wifes death might have slightly unhinged him mentally .
he said it was without doubt an apoplexy , explained the man .
you may remember i was saying so yesterday .
one of us may have to die .
ridiculous , of course , but there it is .
miss sutcliffe flashed a pair of mocking eyes as she spoke .
parker pyne spoke to the driver .
which isexactly ?
youre very persuasive , m .
we wait now for one thing only the mouse .
i think so , charlotte fisher replied in a matter-of-fact voice .
shes got one of those shrewd , limited , practical minds that never do foresee the future and are usually astonished by it .
no , no , of course i did not write to you .
i said incredulously .
she suspected , i think .
and if so , im sorry .
she described it by a rather unusual word to use , as a pilgrimage .
i shall be glad to get rid of him .
i shall tell sir eustace i got no further .
narracott nodded carelessly as though the information were of no value to him .
the next interesting point was the fact that in linnet doyles cabin i found two bottles of coloured nail polish .
you did not see mr .
perhaps she had , perhaps she hadnt .
she led them across the rather bare hall , and into a study where dr .
would you have noticed at all , bunch dear , whether you were followed when you came to london today ?
i had enough of psychiatrists in the army .
poirot said : you had no idea of what was going on actually ?
eleven mark easterbrooks narrative i first hermia .
poirot was thoughtful .
and here i came up against a totally unexpected development .
itits all been like a dream .
from the point of view of appearance it was inartistic , from another standpoint it was supremely artistic .
the accident took place somewhere near a place called bedhampton and really i dont understand what i can have been doing there .
he had seen that there was only one thing to be done and he had done it .
davis died just before the ambulance arrived to take her to hospital .
it was a great moment , that .
roberts ?
the killer , said inspector neele .
i dont think there are any books of rare value or anything like that .
anyway , youll agree , wont you , that it lies between the two of them ?
rushing it on me in this way , peg sobbed , as she lay in a darkened room with a handkerchief soaked in eau-de-cologne on her forehead .
i asked hoarsely , a horrible fear creeping over me .
there was a pause , then she said , with a shiver of uneasiness : why did you ask me that , m .
melchett said : george bartlett ?
wait , she cried in a kind of agony .
not that shed have got anything .
apparently miss adams sat there some time after paying her bill .
he paused and then said : when the truth began to leak out , i was horrified , incredulous .
number four .
ingeniously constructed and told with an engaging lightness of style .
accompanied by a good many achs and sos , he went to work .
we went up on the moor , i rememberquite a long way .
quite definitely , mrs .
but there is no such thing as death , really , you know , only change .
poirot leaned forward confidentially .
blake said heartily : ive parted with my illusions long ago .
he moved towards the door , pausing with his hand on the handle to say over his shoulder : by the way , you once mentioned a will you made .
we crept through the hall and out by the front door .
how did you manage it ?
roger swallowed convulsively .
ill hold him .
the old-world style of philanderer !
she went on with her story , but her delivery became more and more unconvincing as she began to feel that she was not making headway .
eversleigh , dont you ?
you mean he couldnt see anything ?
it is true that he always accuses me of preferring to make things difficult .
manders ?
its lucy whos been very kind to us , said emma .
murder at meadowbank .
everyone for himself , he murmured .
an agitated woman with a slav countenance was pointing a dramatic finger .
ill say it isnt nice !
frances poured a little coffee into the cup .
do try and come and visit us .
the great monsieur poirot .
you know , talking about your books first and how much shed enjoyed the last one , or something like that .
the ravenscrofts didnt seem that kind of person .
we dont want to disturb mr .
youre too smart for that , honey , said her father .
if you please , monsieur bex .
think how pleased the people who collect winter garments for unemployed mothers , or whatever the name of the charity , would be to find a nearly brand new woollen jumper .
its absolutely recognized in musical circles .
as he did so he half sang , half hummed a snatch of french opera : le long des lauriers roses rvant de douces choses .
what do you mean by at first , sir charles ?
this aunt had been left in very reduced circumstances on the death of her father and had used her small capital and a houseful of beautiful things which her father had left her to start in business .
like a wary old tortoise , mr .
inglethorp took sleeping powders ?
but she seems pretty bad .
come along with me if youre not busy .
being the same in both cases , it is not difficult to understand that an error might have been made .
i cant understand dr gerards attitude .
his chauffeur was in consultation with a mechanic .
badcock apparently murdered .
the two small cases as well .
miss lemon seized the opportunity to hurry from the room .
she didnt answer .
why did mademoiselle nick buy a black dress ?
because she told me to .
poirot , to my astonishment , stood stock-still in the middle of the floor and clasped his hands to his head .
a , i hazarded .
awkward frustrated sort of girl .
a good deal may depend on her evidence .
and the ink that is spilt over another students papers , the silk scarf that is cut and slashed .
expecting his sergeant to answer it , the inspector looked meaningfully at him , but cadwallader had become immersed in his notes as he strolled across to the armchair and sat , completely oblivious of the phone .
pauline laughed .
i asked again .
but i knew the moment i looked at herwhen i got backafter and she knew i knew what she didnt realize was that i loved that kid .
you see what im driving at ?
i know , said satterthwaite .
she stood there , her breast heaving , her eyes narrowing to a catlike slit .
weve got a navy , thank god !
rather a domestic upset today it is for that reason exactly i rang you up .
i never wanted to think so .
after all , in every other way hes been perfectly straightforward and aboveboard .
i wonder , said miss marple thoughtfully , what the old lady meant by that remark about a policeman ?
once he caught me by the arm .
she took two dead flowers out of a vase .
let us examine the question together .
he returned with the teapot and they sat down .
several golf balls in fact .
so in the span thats left to me i am king .
the suggestion is utterly absurd .
she was surprised to see me , but it only showed for a flash .
' madame , ' he said .
he cleared up a point that had puzzled me .
they make nests in the chimneys , you know .
id like to murder him !
but you !
crales side , if you like to put it that way .
i wasnt going to leave sanders alone with it .
tempers and tantrums all the time .
but there was still a lot of people about thencommotion , running about on the deck above .
if i had a bit of capital he brooded .
i was walking along the beach , when i met this gentleman , and he pretended he was acquainted with me .
kind of references , if you know what i mean .
demanded rupert in all seriousness .
there are people who deal with that kind of thing ?
she came over a penniless refugee and gratefully agreed to let mrs .
ill read it : dear sir , re your advertisement , i should be glad if you would call round somewhere about lunchtime .
she said with a certain amount of gusto , ' the triangle ' s going strong !
by giving her her freedom he would have been free himself .
elspeth mckay shook her head doubtfully .
the asps was where the meet had taken place , and the date was the date i had met him .
yes ; well do some secret plotting .
one of these dayswhen im seventy-five or so , im going to be a rich man .
i cannot understand roger , said sylvia impatiently .
the guests arrive !
if you were to know the truthif you were to be told the truth , i thinki think perhaps that might satisfy you ?
you are kind .
did you put a hot-water bottle in the bed ?
then , lurching from side to side like a drunkard she disappeared from lous view through the window below into the drawing room .
but then , she pointed out , so do i .
im sorry , you are too old .
because she had no connection with the crime .
he asked : is he , too , on the side of the angelsis that what youre telling me ?
you know it did you all the good in the world .
they have returned not long ago from conducting some very interesting excavations in persia at a site not far from susa .
since i would not fall in with his wishes , he was at perfect liberty to leave his money to whom he pleased .
of course when some women get to that age , thats all they wantbut somehow she paused .
three strong , and jewish at that .
i was afraid someone must hear the real shot , but i knew everyone was dressing for dinner , and would be shut away in their rooms .
ah , my dear boy , so youre back .
bundle reflected .
crome , i noticed , could often be goaded into speech when other methods would have failed .
one of his men spoke up .
also by air ?
why should one give up any hope until one is dead ?
she gasped , hiccuppedand swallowed .
what about her ?
that will be a good thing , said renisenb .
dont remember anybody else .
she thought to herself : its the funny little fellow he isand his eyes green like any cats , and with all that dr .
i wish we could have spared you the pain and publicity of an inquest , but , of course , its quite unavoidable in the absence of a doctors certificate .
double sin and other stories _num_ .
_num_ , that captain harwell had been murdered , done away with .
in our first interview with herill look it upsomething about the key of the pavilion falling out of the door and she picked it up and forgot to replace itwalked out with it and springer bawled her out .
in the course of my reading i found a french play which father discovered me reading .
have you just sent up an electrician to see to the light in this suite ?
the ticket collector looked at her doubtfully .
hersheimmer leant back in his chair .
three characters .
the manager himself stood in the doorway .
i was not impressed .
he hadnt been a strong man to begin with .
the exaggerated self-consciousness of a vain man too accustomed to playing a part to lay it aside easily .
dont bothermrs .
twenty-six not from captain hastings personal narrative inspector crome was listening to the excited utterances of mr .
that is to say , any one of these could be lily gamboll or alternatively eva kanes daughter as far as age goes .
cried the count warmly ; the police should do something about these train bandits .
charles leverson and lady astwell .
she was staying in this hotel , said miss marple , with a mrs .
satipy satipy laugheda hard-sounding , high laugh , and went back into the house .
i think your imagination is running away with you a little , mark .
hateful .
bridget said calmly : thats because im such a rotten tennis player .
why do you call me hannah ?
and it hadnt gone wrong !
he was engaged to miss kennedy , wasnt he ?
but this was another noisea very faint businesslike click .
i did everything short of cheating to see that she did not winthat is , i held her mallet for her carelessly , played quickly , hardly aimed at allyet somehow the more carelessly i played , the more fortunate isabel seemed to be .
its a school that tries to make the best of both worlds : the past and the future , but the real stress is on the present .
my grandfather was popularly supposed to have sold his soul to the devil .
shes not been kidnapped has she ?
let me get you a cocktail , said mr .
now she rose .
our first step was to engage the services of an artist in makeup .
orsomething quite different ?
you wouldnt look at me .
i said : you cant marry franklin yetso soon .
asked julius , with a gesture of despair .
i never felt like that .
the inspector was again silent as he reflected .
why doesnt everyone learn ?
i think that would be the best plan , mr .
then he stopped and came to a stand in front of poirot .
a devilish glint appeared in lances eyes .
the room into which we were shown was a kind of library .
there are a lot of things i knowindeed theres not much i dont know of what goes on in this house .
it was a mere rhetorical gesture .
so educative .
it must really be quite tiring .
after all , if there were anan outburstit would be awkward and embarrassing , but nothing more .
why these select few ?
but the comedy may be played in earnestit may become a tragedy .
whos that youve been with out there ?
how did the subject come up ?
ill do what i can , said spence .
surely i am what you call a scoop , arent i ?
it is curious , you admit ?
everything is for the best they say .
not very much , monsieur .
then there was william crabtree .
to return the stone anonymously would have presented great difficulties .
in every angle was a grey mass of cobweb .
so you are not going to tell me anything either ?
what an extraordinary fellow you are , rogers .
everyone welcome !
she paused and then said : i do not understand .
patrick redfern and emily brewster had got to the cove and seen a body lying there .
also , without doubt , there is dust on my coat .
i see now that all these years i couldnt forgive him , and yet i really wanted to .
hm , said japp .
but instead there was a vast uprising of forsythia which at this particular place seemed to have got above itself and effectually shut out all view of the sea .
it had done with mrs .
ive just had a wire from her confirming it and saying they are definitely arriving tomorrow .
presumably from long years of disuse , the pedals were no longer workable .
until then , i am content to wait .
yes , inspector japp .
a man with many friends .
i knew i would have to go sooner or later .
its all discipline .
she stared at me , and then began laughing laughing laughing it was horrible to hear her !
i made a sudden movement and elliot haydon , richards cousin , turned quickly to me .
he said rather weakly : and you dont think it was suicide ?
emerson did say , i remember , that she had been working very hard .
well start with her friends .
i toznyself free , slipped through the window , and ran formy life en i perceived the lights in this house , and made for the , , .
too ill to attend the inquest indeed !
a fair amount of people were walking on the pavement .
shell carry on where you leave off , said ann gathering up her things .
what happened to the others ?
number fours mind , it does not act that way .
she felt that she was no longer sitting alone on the seat in the casino gardens , but that someone was standing beside her , and that that someone was the dead woman , ruth kettering .
the terrible woman went on : i was a great friend of your wifes , you know !
do you all like being bullied and ordered about by her that you make such a to do because she behaves herself properly for once ?
she wants you to go down and sing .
not a sign of him .
as far as he knew , the man wasnt suspected .
autocratic again , she finished him off !
poirot said : you , i think , are just the man i seek .
army , navy , air force , foreign office , one and all say the same thingim too old .
had he been fooled once more ?
i just stepped outside for a second , and then i saw you through the window , coming into the room , so i thought it didnt matter .
martha was ironing .
it was not the first time he had seen her .
he caught frantically with both hands to a projection in the wall beside him .
a voice said , come in .
sustained by it , one walks on air , creating in ones own mind heroic occasions on which one will be of service to the beloved one .
ackroyd in the library at nine-thirty could not possibly have been your son .
in spite of your wife saying that it tasted odd ?
i like being alone .
i could not go .
but it might possibly have been a shot that awakened you ?
half an hour ago , said miss marple , thoughtfully , that would have beenlet me seeeight oclock .
he now turned his chair round to face it .
i did hear somebody else had been there , too , but i never heard the name .
is shecould she have some sorrow that we know nothing about ?
she saw what it was the men with the candles were looking at .
he tore the letter across and threw it into the wastepaper basket .
that isnt mitzi !
id just adore a high-toned garden , said the countess dreamily .
one doesnt really forget people , does one ?
lombard said dryly : its easier of belief than the truth !
there never was a man as good as mr .
thats what puzzled me .
but it is a little different from that is it not ?
but finally , just when it was time for me to go , she did open her eyes and looked at mei dont know if she was mistaking me for someonebut she did say that word .
you know that she wrote to her daughterthe last words she ever wrotethat she was innocent ?
because of your beauty i wish you well .
but principally you were afraid for yourself .
oh yes , they had a word for it .
they had drunk a pouilly fuiss followed by a corton , and a very good port now reposed at mr .
and mind this , they prepare things a long time beforehand .
they wouldnt , of course .
said japp as the car turned the corner of the mews .
spenlows new dress this afternoon .
somebody has been talking to you ?
i do not think so as yet , said poirot , but she might know something before very long .
he accepted it dubiously .
how ingenious you are .
of course no actual blame can attach to him , it was not his fault in any way .
darling pat how he loved her .
now , as he broke off his sentence , that same faraway speculative look returned .
burton , said tommy .
amyas was always meeting one woman or other who was different .
very faintly something stirred in her mind just after the ticket collector had clipped their tickets .
so we settled on caledonia , and it was a great success .
no _num_ is bauerour footman .
lenox , who was observant in her own way , noticed this , and offered to take katherine upstairs to see her room .
at this second repetition her voice changed a littlesomething queer and speculative came into it .
' mayfield frowned a little in the effort of remembrance .
i was being followed .
he was at the caterers dinner all right , but left rather early before the end of the speeches .
turn the car first , george .
did most of her work in rubber gloves or housemaids gloves , it seems .
very nice cabin , miss .
si , signor dottore , si lei permette , poirot replied .
he had his glasses on .
her cheese souffl last night was quite uneatable .
yes , sir , thatll be up to him , that will .
now my friend , we will go back once more to that little clearing in the shrubbery .
egg , my sweet , what do i care for miss milrays worries ?
stephen farr swung round upon him .
twelve anthony tells his story mr .
it was possibly this remark which induced the driver to move away .
goodness , said frankie , id forgotten all about her .
the colonel went to see quinton , the vet , about one of the horses .
a matter of principle .
on the first occasion , clare really was out ; on the second , she slipped out by the back way when she saw vivien coming up the path .
beryl collins tapped on the bedroom door and came in .
i divorced my first husband .
medium height , he thinks , dark blue overcoator could be brown .
her husband nodded .
if id gone it would have meant leaving her very short .
and , of course , thats exactly what it was .
come , come my young friend , youre talking at random .
i have looked at everything the wrong way round .
the letter from your secretary ?
its my lights .
it might have been mulligan instead of corrigan , agreed the doctor with a grin .
delightful fellows .
it was odd that nowadays it should be the educated girls who went in for all the domestic chores .
juliuss pent-up rage burst forth .
jefferson , had coffee with them afterwards when ruby keene joined them .
this letter goes to you twenty-four hours in advance of the letters to the other two .
but tuppence shook her head .
here for a moment it paused by the kerb , and the young woman got out .
that would be a bit too much of a coincidence .
lucy rose at six the next morning .
the way youve got it , its all blurred and twisted .
ones back , you know .
but the coniine was in the glassnot in the bottle .
i dont think that up till that moment id ever felt any of the so-called glamour of the east .
a lot of people make the same mistake .
said the valet .
i took my courage in both hands and spoke .
in any case , continued japp , shes holding out on us .
my great-aunt maria had a great purse full of sovereigns .
its a very difficult mistake to imagine , said inspector cornish .
its a kind of album , she said , i think .
the car was ordered for five-thirty to take them to the village .
that has amazed me , i can assure you .
there was the dining room leading into the office where the files were kept and the cataloguing and typing was done .
travelling expenses to baghdad were what mrs .
but what possible motive could marthe have for murdering mr .
emboldened by this sign of favour , charles plunged .
the whole things a sell .
im the spendthrift prodigal son .
what about magda ?
but i never sent you any chocolates , darling .
helen felt ill , came down and rang up the doctor , and then but she didnt ring up the doctor , said rosamund .
i was resigned to being always the slow one .
im most anxious that no wrong impression should get about .
the circumstances under which i killed him were such that no jury on earth would have convicted me .
cross my palm with silver and ill tell your fortune .
probably most of what ive heard is legend .
i want to try a little plan of my own .
a very charming girl , i believe .
then he said quietly , really , we dont know anything about them , sergeant trotter .
' i said eagerly .
he asked genially .
you will consent to my little arrangement , yes ?
now , have you any idea , mr .
poirot is a detective employed on purpose to hunt him down .
the letters were underlined and it made a sentence when you put it together .
it was the evening before her departure from the canaries .
hed been listening outside the door of the flat , but couldnt hear anything .
i said good-bye to oliver costello , and hed gone off with miss peake .
certainly she was easy upon the eyes .
soits an aristides enterprise .
the set of china figures from which the costumes were copied .
something is going to be done , said mrs .
he looked from the severe disapproving face of miss lemon to the kindly , distressed face of mrs .
the police might have asked a lot of awkward questions and made a lot of awkward enquiries as to times and places .
if he knew half what i know about doctorsinnocents , thats what they are !
i will have hori .
there was something i wanted to ask you , i reiterated as poppy was rather clumsily draping the asparagus fern round the roses .
oh , said the girl , in a slightly breathless voice .
one forgets , she said .
and miss greggs husband , mr .
how was your old lady ?
nicotine .
it was very kind of him .
the man came and put it right on tuesday morning .
norton was only five foot five , i should say .
any question of prosecution ?
thatsthats an awfully hard thing to say , she said .
its taken a terrible toll of him , sir .
so it may be with those fingerprintsthey may lead you nowhere .
there is nothing especialor significant that you can remember ?
ah , yes , what i was going to say was this .
nan , who was two years older than i was , went in for being an enfant terrible , and took a special pleasure in shouting , being rude , and using swear words .
you are not tired of life .
it is impossible for him to be present in person .
police-constable palk replaced the receiver , uttered a longdrawn whistle and proceeded to dial his superior officers number .
but he was not to escape the consequences of his crime .
frankie bought a two-shilling book of stamps , commented on the weather and then said : but i expect you always have better weather here than we do in my part of the world .
the woman you call clayton is your mothers sister , beatrice barron .
but , as i told you , i dont want to sell the old boy .
poirot looked after him .
cavendish early in their married life .
how sanitary and public-spirited of you , darling !
theres been a feelingi cant describe it .
the two men smiled at each other in mutual accord .
imhotep said to nofret : your jewels and your clothes are here safely .
he was what mrs .
i suppose , in a way , it was murder .
she made a new and very unexpected will .
meredith panted out : go after her .
it is , i believe , within your province to order documents produced in your court to be destroyed , or to be impounded as you think fit .
five hercule poirot receives a letter the events which i have just narrated were not , of course , known to me until a long time afterwards .
been oiling this key , isaac must have , he said .
took out my carmy car !
said the voice .
he was close to her when she looked up and saw him .
he showed no enthusiasm for a visit from you and would give me no reply to your request that he would le bygones be bygones .
what is it , madre ?
old isaac , i mean .
thinking of buying old furniture , and bright carpets , and futurist silk curtains , and a polished dining table , and a divan with lots of cushions hold hard , said tommy .
ah , but hes nabbed , said the first one .
just some slighting reference .
if they did not succeedif their backing was withdrawnmiss chadwick had an anxious mind and could always tabulate innumerable ifs .
parlourmaids had to be tall , to look smart , to have been perfectly trained , to have the right voice in which to murmur : hock or sherry ?
theres a very suitable house weve heard of for sale .
ruby keene never mentioned the matter to you ?
she hesitated and then said : is that mrs .
poirot listened sympathetically .
in the hall were chairs and settees and dressers with china and pewter on them .
i think thats rather stupid , dont you ?
you say it was nine oclock , dr .
ive usually found most people kick up no end of a fuss .
men have killed their brothers since the beginning of time , knowing that the gods dislike such killing , yet driven by the evils of covetousness and hatred .
first she said her supply was intact , and now she says it isnt .
i never went near the window how did the blood come on my hand ?
well , we have one or two extra light ones for ladies , but this is the general article we sell .
said the old gentleman surveying him apoplectically .
the other evening , after talk about mirror images and seeing oneself i think mrs .
i shall never forget that night .
the policemans horse is clanking his chain , and the window and door refuse to stay shut , and burst open alternately .
that , miss marple was quite sure , was true .
mcginty mcginty .
ten minutes were spent in trying to put the girl at her ease , the shivering gladys explaining that she couldnt everthat she didnt ought , that she didnt think rose would have given her away , that anyway she hadnt meant no harm , indeed she hadnt , and that shed catch it badly if mrs .
i wouldnt say that , said desmond .
the chloroform firstthen when the victim is unconscious the prick of the needle .
a cruel business but necessary .
in fact i had hardly noticed the house .
you cant really prefer them all dark and mustard coloured , protested ginger .
hannibal , now fully alerted , was racing round and round the pampas grass .
looking slightly quizzical , mr .
i think , said colin , i think what about it , michael ?
i just came in to fetch punch .
i looked at his healthy though rubicund face and then at his thermometer , which he held out to me , and which read between _num_ and _num_ .
who is the egoist ?
he slipped down a little in his chair .
so nancy sent for you , after all , did she ?
iris asked in a calm voice : he thought id done it , didnt he ?
the tripp women say that miss lawson was completely taken aback when the will was read , i said thoughtfully .
' ' she was down here today ?
he paused and added : rotteneven for an ass like poor old george .
you remember her murder ?
yes , i do , mr .
according to my ideas , we have here not only a murder and also a suicide , but we have as well what i shall call an execution , and we have a tragedy also .
you mean , said lady tressilian , that you think she is still hankering after nevile and thatoh no !
that was miss wilhelmina lawson , miss arundells companion .
i have any amount of literature i can lend you .
only , of course , everythings madly earnest , and you tumble over psychiatrists everywhere underfoot .
quite so , said lord caterham .
satterthwaite , however , was not easily put off .
said jimmy , and registered to himself an impression that ronny devereux was damned odd about it all .
presently i heard footsteps outside , they paused for a minute , then retreated .
her natural leaning towards adventure may be regarded as either meritorious or the reverse in this modern age which places the value of security high .
and sometimes theyre wrong .
perhaps she would not wish to come and see me , but a meeting could be brought about .
very expensive it was to put it right .
some of us can , some of us cant .
ill just take a look through the windows and see if i can find any signs of life .
a light touch was incomprehensible to him .
the dacres , they were at both .
the mystery of the missing attachecase .
young men or boysattacking or attacked .
lady , she hear you come back ; she ask for you .
but miss marple has brought us one valuable bit of testimony .
only i hadnt realized she was your secretary .
perenna thereupon accompanied him to a small bedroom , the door of which happened to be just opposite the door of mrs .
perhaps she could never feel like that about anyone .
vera nodded .
she gets in such a frightful state about things and shed go and tell everyone .
there was a creak above .
pull back the curtains .
nobody saw me .
i ' ve been over the whole house now .
to go back to brian pearson fulfilling the conditions , said emily .
his room is actually booked for another guest .
it was lucky for her , i think , that she died young before she had time to be upset by the way her son was turning out .
he was threatening john .
everything i have in the world i owe to him .
i talked to the counsel who defended caroline crale , to the junior counsel for the crown , to the old solicitor who had known the crale family intimately , to the lawyers clerk who had been in court during the trial , to the police officer in charge of the caseand i came finally to the five eyewitnesses who had been upon the scene .
harold suggested , catching at a straw : youll be able to say that at leastthat it was all perfectly all right .
he said : does miss darnley say that ?
the old lady looked at her .
a chair placed inconspicuously in the shadow of an oak press just where the corridor ran into the main gallery formed a perfect vantage ground .
i had the rifle reloaded when he turned for it .
you met some of them the other night and i wondered if you could give me any useful dopeon the foreigners , anyway .
i must say i was very surprised .
he was broken down by mrs taylors death .
veronica was waiting for him .
miss blacklock herself had abandoned the effort to behave with her normal cheerfulness .
i dont quite know , said tuppence meditatively .
no , it wont .
she smiledwe bored each other to death .
hercule poirot got up .
harbottle !
he opened his eyes .
ah , yes , indeed , me , i know that well .
anthony marston , mrs .
they had a few words with the other members of the staff , scared-looking juniors in awe of mrs .
may i fetch major blunt ?
auden : the life of a poet ( _num_ ) and the life and crimes of agatha christie ( _num_ ) .
out of every fifty baskets , one will contain an imitation necklace in different coloured stones .
teatime .
the sounds quite different .
the duke is in paris , said jane .
that was when she stopped abruptly .
cartwright in the council chamber .
see what an air , lopsided and unsymmetrical , it gives him .
vyse , commander challenger the last name awoke a chord of compunction in my mind .
the divisional surgeon seems very annoyed at finding no corpse to examine .
she was taking up a good deal of designing .
miss carroll was still looking at her anxiously .
i myself never went down to any shelter during the war .
lee , he must have been very good-looking when he was young .
and say theyll do it all themselves .
scuttle .
albert evans , i gather , his name was .
hes bad all through .
kennedy to giles and gwenda .
vandemeyer stamped her foot .
what could this be but yet another festival hall in which a production was being given .
cowan was agreeably surprised , and prayed that this state of things might continue .
but enough time has passed now for ordinary things to reassume their value .
barnes nodded .
also , the overall point of characters pretending to be other than they are will be a constant feature of christies fiction for the next fifty years .
its all a plot .
the three women left the room .
no one could have been more astonished than dr .
ten oclock tomorrow morning will do .
it is over .
you know , not exactly boasting , but just say , you know : oh yes , weve got really one or two interesting finds .
so then we hit upon getting dr .
and , leaning forward , he drew something from the handle of the dagger and held it up for me to see .
hes forgotten more about this game than youll know for many years to come .
she had no judgement , no balance , and a crude childish point of view , but she had also the childs uncanny knack of sometimes hitting the nail on the head in a way that seemed quite startling .
the open circle of sunlight at the end grew larger .
to be as unlike each other as they could .
it may be of no importancequite conceivably .
but i should have thought , said gwenda , that it would have been better from his point of view for my father actually to have been convicted of the murder .
and so they hand out a larger tip or a little present of money .
or i would rather die than have my daughter discover who she is !
and if youre quite sure that there will only be ourselves this weekend mr .
i had no idea that he was expected to dinner that night .
look here , aunt emily , sorry to bother you , but im in the devil of a hole .
ten it was past eight oclock when poirot got back to the stag .
shed a sharp tongue and shed stand up to anybody .
anyway , you think no harm would be done ?
from behind the magnolia tree michael weyman came quietly into view , paused a moment irresolutely and then followed the tall slim figure down into the trees .
they were all killed : the pilot , mrs .
the word came with no uncertain emphasis .
im not really afraid of jackie doing any melodramatic shooting stuff , but this spying and following business has absolutely got linnet on the raw .
she asked in exasperation .
madame , if when you were playing bridge , someone were to say to youwhy do you play that ace or why do you put on the knave that is taken by the queen and not the king which would take the trick ?
if the vicar and his lady are satisfied thats all that matters , i think , miss , i said .
miss johnson said slowly , weighing her words in a detached way : i have imaginedsincethat at some time during the afternoon i heard a very faint cry .
peculiar things did happen in a solicitors business , and of course the inspector would understand that discretion , etc .
just someone walking over my grave , as they say .
oh , monsieur !
its the child that matters .
i thought perhaps she paused , disappointed .
these are all theories , said valerie , and rather farfetched theories at that .
dont be afraid , my child .
if you remember , one shoe was stolen .
it was at this point that sergeant hay came into the room saying urgently , sir .
one of these quiet gentlemen who get easily flustered .
thats all to the good as far as it goes , slack explained gloomily .
i prepared her for confirmation , i used to hold services in lent , for easter , on other occasions , in elizabeth temples school .
she is charming .
yes , of course , simon .
she spoke almost pleadingly .
chapman was in the secret service , i mean .
stokes was a middle-aged man with greying hair and spectacles .
ah , miss marple , sitting here all aloneand not even knitting ?
this was no spontaneous crime committed on the spur of the moment .
i suppose i thought unconsciously that would worry old poirot , and then i began talking about him .
awful exercises i had to repeat and repeat .
i did not know it was the boathouse attached to this house .
she held her head high and her eyes glittered .
the same kind of thing as they did to the child joyce ?
emily ascended to the very top of sittaford tor , a pile of grey rock of a fantastic shape .
odd that you should use that word , said dr .
i asked with some curiosity , putting aside a half-formed wonder as to the character and disposition of the late madame poirot , and her classical taste in christian names .
the day came at last when i once more embarked on the six-wheeler , this time being careful to have reserved a seat near the front of the bus so that i should not again disgrace myself .
you neednt be afraid !
he did not , he confessed it to himself , really like the country .
sandford said so .
vera looked up at the house from where they were standing .
and that visit of his to the wellerman kreutz institutesomehow or other he must have got hold of some culture of germs and infected humbleby .
doyles cabin , which is next door to her own ?
a distant cousin of mine died a short time ago and left me a tiny estate out thereoh , nothing much .
he left me a very big legacy , said esther .
still , the stone is known as the star of the east .
it was sheer accident her bringing the girl down .
lydia said sharply : really , m .
no , curiously enough , i wasnt afraidnot more than anyone else , that is to say .
one passenger didnt report and they called her and they called her again .
presently the dancer raised herself on her elbow and stared at him curiously .
when the cups were filled and handed round and gwenda had taken a piece of toast , dr .
thats the master , that is .
hes the type that would smash in his own grandmothers head if he thought he could get away with it and if he knew hed make something out of it .
you know the history of ostrova .
as often as you like .
after all , its not as though you were just a careless boy , miss bennett told him , reassuringly .
so rosemary might have slipped the cachet in her bag and then , during the cabaret , with a headache increasing , she might have dropped it into her champagne glass and let it dissolve .
all right , do you think ?
well , i will tell you what i think .
she has a fatalistic nature .
quite all right , i said .
its my life , not georgesand anyway george is dead .
he touched his left shoulder and winced realistically .
how ridiculous !
no cheques , he said .
it becomes monotonous after a while .
he slipped through , closing the door softly behind him .
i cannot do more .
they retraced their steps to the moat house .
all the same miss cooke had dyed her hair and altered her style of hairdressing .
he couldnt be disturbed as he was writing , the maid had said at first , but the inspector had produced an official card and bade her take it to her master without delay .
in the meantime i wonder if you could give me any idea who lady tressilians solicitors are ?
if i had a cause i certainly would .
greta wouldnt be in the way , said ellie , and shed be very useful .
mary said rather dispiritedly : yes .
and thats why i thought at once of the toys , the dolls house and the toy cupboards ?
martins or st .
and now here was patricia looking like an earnest madonna .
the cook was got out of the way , i realize that , i said , slightly piqued .
both deserters this morning ?
no wonder !
the inglethorps did not appear .
she raised a shaking hand to her face .
i suppose i haveit sounds rather disgusting , somehow !
and then i learned she had sent for a detective ; and i found out , too , that she was leaving her money to katrina that miserable little creature !
thats the last time i saw her .
oh , angell .
he boasted a great deal of his various smart dealings .
and then , said giles , you lost your job .
why on earth did you do that ?
afterwards , he was dragged across the floor to the other window , and laid there instead , but not quite at the same angle , as the doctors evidence told us .
youre making that up , giles .
etienne de sousawho is he ?
so i will go on with what i was about to say .
restarick died on the _num_ th april , _num_ .
led by some instinct for which he did not account , dermot switched off his light , slipped on an overcoat that lay across a chair , and opened the hall door .
old bantry !
it was not the same to them and so they came home and accepted the invitation that has always been given them and renewed every year by old tom addison .
i put my arms round her and held her to me .
now hercule poirot , assisted by captain hastings and inspector japp , must unravel a tangle of family feuds , old flames , and suspicious foreigners to find the killer and prevent a global catastrophe .
poirot said meekly : my ideas are doubtless old-fashioned , but i am perfectly prepared to listen to you , mr .
according to agatha christies autobiography , it was a revised version of the unpublished the house of beauty , written before the first world war and the first thing i ever wrote that showed any kind of promise .
it was a lovely night , warm and soft , and the moon was rising .
did i say funny ?
he could not and did not want to agree with people .
now that youre not hampered by her being there , tell us all about it .
you know , there was a lot of flour about , and paper caps out of crackers and different things .
it was unlocked and she went inside .
i shouldnt be happy staying here inactive .
he asked , with a grin .
i dont think i saw anything of that kind .
desmond looked rather doubtfully at the figure confronting him .
allen was already dead when you left it .
oh , no , im the housekeepermore housekeeper than secretary , sometimes , in this house .
no , you killed him before you left the house the first time .
tommy , why shouldnt it be suicide , after all ?
for mrs allen was seen going to the post-box that evening .
but nothing important that i can remember , nothing that joyce took an interest in or anything of that kind .
you were at that time turning over in your mind various plans for the murder of your brother .
well , your guesses are very good sometimes , said tuppence hopefully .
weston recalled him to the needs of the moment .
he could have driven over , gone into the house , killed her and driven away again .
what did mr .
i can still hear now , if i sit quiet a minute or two with my eyes closed , her voice , and see her face in the last words of the play : pour sauver ma fille , jai tu ma mre , and the deep thrill this sent through one as the curtain came down .
noit seems to me thatsomehowthe facts no longer fit .
and shes really a very nice kind creature .
but he had been too quick for this dream !
people who have been close as an oyster all their lives seem positively to relish causing trouble when they themselves shall be comfortably dead .
burns is always pleasant , and good-tempered .
selma goetz and her brood , it says .
just tell me , said mrs .
anyway , walter fane falls in love with helen halliday .
take him away , will you ?
after an evening of second fiddle , sir charless egoism was taking its revenge .
ten oclock at the outsidebut seven thirty to eight seems clearly indicated .
under your very noseif youd let the whole thing alone this wouldnt have happenedits you who have murdered charlesyouyouyou .
he pushed and the door slid open noiselessly .
she lived in a rehabilitated apartment consisting of a series of rooms in one wing of a large georgian manor house in the country which she had inherited from his grandfather .
i think weve both said all there is to be said .
he was a good-looking young frenchman of about thirty-two , with a fresh-coloured face and a little black moustache .
it had common pebbles in it .
bit of paper which has contained cyanide found in your bag .
what did you talk about , miss cray ?
so she swallowed it and called out and nurse came rushing , but we couldnt do anything .
what happened to the craig children ?
with a laugh which was close to a sneer , the secretary continued , you never guessed , did you , even when you said that the whisky was bitter ?
and sobek has made a fool of himself over the sale of the timber and is afraid my father will be furious when he finds out .
i have had a tiring day .
when she had gone , he said to the sergeant : so that was george bartons famous plan .
inquest on friday , if that suits you , dr .
but i really know very little about him , he doesnt do much in a social way .
he and my husband had a terrific battle over the details of the service on all saints day .
sometimes you know , i feel frightened of him .
it was a pleasant homey atmosphere .
she was handsome , she was strong , she was , i thought , a woman of intense emotional feeling .
presently he was saying : entwhistle speaking .
' i think i am correct in saying , lord mayfield , that about five years ago you passed through a somewhat trying time .
fellow who seduces a girls not necessarily a villain .
he went straight home , he says .
we had the planchette and reallyit wrote the most interesting things .
unless i gave her the price she wanted , she threatened to sell them back to him .
im trying to find out just why you wont let things drop .
oheryes , he said .
no , it has not been easy .
but the uncles enjoyed themselves .
not that way , please , he instructed her , and led her over to the hall door .
he said briskly : now , mr .
some fifteen years ago your wife lived with this man for a few months .
he gave a sudden shiver and explained himself apologetically .
myself , sad and lonely , the woman beside me also a bitter and disillusioned creature .
all along you have envisaged the situation calmly and collectively .
well , you mustnt be depressed , old cock , said japp .
why do you say that i am in the middle of it ?
lombard said : come on , hand it over .
an elderly man , very yellow of face , with a little goatee beard .
special ones with lots of tails , from japan or somewhere .
and he did .
on june _num_ , suddenly , at his residence , sandgate , wychwood-under-ashe , john edward humbleby , md , beloved husband of jessie rose humbleby .
raymond had dealt with everything .
somethings slipped down behind .
want to do the best i can for sylviasylvia and tommy .
i always remember grannie leaning across the dining-table and saying , either to me or to my sister , ssh !
cant see another house from here , can you ?
rymers wrist .
they have certainly been a very ill-fated family , said mr .
a diamond .
the shock of her friends death did not upset her as much as i should have thought it would have done .
there would be such wonderful things to do , hummed albert .
here , while belcher and archie were busy putting forth the claims of the british empire , migration within the empire , the importance of trade within the empire , and so on and so forth , i was allowed to spend a happy day sitting in the orange groves .
and that is impossible given ordinary conditions , said fournier .
seven letters mrs .
turning her head over her shoulder she said : its a telegram .
keeping her eyes fixed steadily on the others face , tuppence replied quietly : money mrs .
he declares he would never have got on without them .
you wouldnt know about it , i expect .
i think you know , said miss marple .
they seem heavily laden , he murmured .
i was fearfully keen about the war , and just dying to help somehow or other .
she was an admirer of kingsley .
you probably have all heard by now of the few words i overheard between miss debenham and colonel arbuthnot .
eh , bien , the golf clubs had gone naturally .
france as sir claud .
there would be spring and autumn , there would be little wild cyclamen and there would be autumn crocus here too .
about this note which you have produced so opportunely , is the handwriting not familiar to you ?
' ' as far as you know there has not been any quarrel ?
he murmured delicately .
part of his training was to uphold discipline , to make sure that his superiors were only accosted at the proper times and in the proper places .
its very odd , said anthony , when the story was finished .
this is a very strange case , i said to settle .
now where does it get us ?
arabella richardson .
but here is a cabin belonging to a man who cannot possibly visit it himself so that , if the pearls are found here , it tells us nothing at all .
the table was laid and sunday midday dinner was served .
perhaps you may like to come with us when we go to visit st .
he next pulled out a small tube .
there was no need if you knew that i recognized it , i said rather bitterly .
the golden ball and other stories _num_ .
i cant imagine mary committing suicide .
_num_ the personk .
lots of factors to take into account .
youre the foreign gentleman from up at summerhayes ?
it seemed a highly reasonable point of view .
cust came quietly down the stairs , a bag in his hand .
mlle mauhourat was particularly full of gush , and gush made me feel shy .
the companion !
never mind , aunt letty , said patrick , julia will come across a snapshot of herself in about thirty years timeand wont she think she looks a guy !
he just loosed off , as i say , blindly .
there are not many people travelling , i imagine ?
' ' of course not .
it was in her trunk with a wrapper round it and for miss pope from winnie written on it .
later in the night , all three were taken ill , and a doctor was hastily summoned .
i was just struck by the contrasti was here , you know , many years ago , as a young man .
he looked often towards his wife , and it was plain that he expected her to take the lead in any conversation .
andrew petersandy to my friends .
oh yes , said miss livingstone , looking shrewdly at her employer to see if she was right in the feelings that she sometimes had that mrs .
anyway , she came right across and looked out .
sfillingtleet said , ' funny room for a rich man to choose as his own sanctum , with that outlook .
the ignorant layman , or laywoman , as i suppose i ought to call myself , believes that the doctor studies your case individually , considers what drugs would be best for it , and writes a prescription to that effect .
hercule poirot caught his breath .
to sittaford , miss .
lemprire as she turned it to the light .
theres something in it , no doubt , said battle thoughtfully .
not a real lock , you know , a piece of water , it was .
the young lady , the one in white , she telephoned at once when she got here .
youll find that our lady wasnt there , or that she came in lateeleven oclock or so .
kameni had long gone from the courtyard .
not that i ever knew much of them .
and now it is gone .
he was quite a good-looking man with a thin dark face and eyes set rather too close together .
no end of a shemozzle theres been there lately , he said .
his head was poked down well into his neck .
ive still got someone making inquiries over there .
i suspected that he was lying .
exactly , thought miss marple , like poor mrs .
since her aunts death ?
lombard said as he straightened up : satisfied ?
fowler , been right next door and never heard a sound .
he likes your saying that , said tuppence , it must be true .
butoh , i seeno , i dont .
god knows where those diamonds are at this minute .
you forget .
what was mary capable of to get what she wanted ?
where were you standing when you shot richard ?
and then well , then , i suppose major rich goes to bed andoh !
it seemed to mei had to think quickly , you understandthe best thing to do !
theo was well-bredshe would not air her grievances in public .
he looked again at his watch and got up .
jims pretty fed up too .
olivers eloquent eye .
his moustache was distinctly stiff and military .
and this kidnapping on top of everything else .
because you never know whats coming next ?
a stout american lady , who was sitting opposite , leaned forward and spoke to him with the deliberate intonation of her race .
if you have not committed a murder , it naturally annoys you if it seems someone thinks that you have , said inspector craddock mildly .
that left the persons you were interviewing relieved and predisposed them to be more unguarded in the next interview you had with them .
your man is in the air force , i seeso was a son of mine who was killed .
then thats all right , said maureen cheerfully .
i got you in on all this .
excited , i thought .
i arranged for that .
but there is something i want to tell youi she looked round uncertainly .
practically the same colour as molly kendals , isnt it ?
tonight , we stage such a play in end house .
goby was very expensive .
i was there as a child .
at five minutes past ten .
he was neither good-looking nor plain , tall nor short .
the three passengers took their places in the machine again and the flight continued .
he paused a minute .
well , i mean i shall be working as a mechanic most of the time .
she must , in future , curb the natural exuberance that led her to brighten up the performance of a dull job .
practically an alleyway , bounded by the railway on one side .
tommy had assisted at a midnight ritual of some kind .
to begin with , she must be in with a very queer set of peopleblackmailers and terroristsassociates who will do her no good , and will probably bring her to a miserable end .
she said , there are limits .
youve never been backward in thinking things .
people were hurrying up and down the platform .
well , i suppose itll still come in handy , said albert .
something terribly important is happening tonight , she told them .
see you , hastings ?
there were so many .
it wont work , you know .
every time that one thinks of a private reason for morleys death , hey prestothe card is forced on one .
id rather you saw the doctor .
im starting with you , mr .
andfor the momentnothing doing .
lynn said in a low voice , what you must think of uswhat you must think of us !
but if she found something going on that she didnt understand shed be quite determined to get to the bottom of it .
she twisted to and fro in her chair .
miss marple closed her lips .
if so , did she come by car or by train ?
worse ?
no , dont speak , dont move .
the rest of the morning is quite blank in my mind .
not if we can get on the trail straight away .
if they want a particular period table or chair , or a certain piece of china , they write to her , and , sooner or later , she gets it for them .
quite frankly , he terrorized geraldine .
it seems sad that the house will not be lived in , but of course it is not a practicable proposition nowadays .
lilac ink would be even better , i think .
either the aunt or the niece , he thought , had an original streak in her makeup .
you , i know , believe in ghosts and spirits .
her imagination pictured a lurking murderer behind one of the boulders .
we had to get on in the world .
frankie remembered with curious clearness moira saying , its just nerves .
she is of age , madame your wife ?
burton-cox and say , im very sorry but i really feel i cannot oblige you in this matter , or whatever words you like to put .
in spite of taking a pot-shot at eddie groves some few years later ?
then theerperson became abusive .
hospital nurses are used to handling drugs , said miss ramsbottom .
she didnt saysay anythingany explanation of what had happened ?
dermot craddock shook his head .
ah , i rememberit is the actor raymond barraclough .
miss de bellefort wasshe was fanthorp came to the rescue .
youre absolutely right .
sir george and lady marroway came from a different worldthe world of antibes and juan les pinsof golf at st .
i could use a stronger word .
it was a clear , definite statement .
tuppences next port of call was the flat in clarges street .
he detached the little scrap of paper with care .
with it went dark eyes and very black lashesthe effect somewhat enhanced by art .
he told himself repeatedly that it was absurd to jump to conclusionsthat it was fantastic to imagine that moira had been done away with in a house full of possible witnessesthat there was probably some perfectly simple explanation and that at the worst she could only be a prisoner in the grange .
im afraid , you know , one does enjoy a bit of malice now and then .
had perhaps the problem he had been considering at the time of his death sent his mind back to that visit to the west indies ?
not conducive to foul play .
im going awaybecause of you .
did i understand dr .
servants are so jealous and so small-minded .
marchmont .
this is our own roman policier , is it not ?
my name is elizabeth she stopped abruptly .
there was another drawer full of old photographs and sketching books .
but you can see very clearly from the kitchen window who goes in and out , cant you ?
did he ever tell you that he had diamonds in the safe in his room ?
she could cope with driving better if she were not distracted by conversation .
rosamund said calmly : if i wanted to know , yes .
oh , yes , sir , certainly .
the official reply is : because the police think you can assist them in their inquiries .
you had your adenoids out when you were eight years old , so there is no excuse for it .
hercule poirot considered , pulling his moustaches .
she pressed the bell .
poor thomasina , said mrs .
he was a german .
mr bonnington looked at him .
ill be frank with you .
did you produce it ?
his eyes met hers , a curious speculative look in them that made susan feel uncomfortable .
free from the impact of a stronger personality .
shall i put it like that ?
_num_ broadway new york , ny _num_ http : //www .
she was worried and afraid .
so far , he had found the memoirs insufferably dull , with no hint of scandal of any kind .
it wouldnt matter , continued barbara , if wed never known anything else .
he put his arm round her protectingly .
i suppose , he mused , that that was some curious effect of my subsconcious self .
the crowd spread out round him .
why , even at the antique dealers fair i wouldnt have thought it would fetch anything near to that .
beside her , an english milord stakes the maximum alsoon the next number .
bauerstein seem sopeculiar ?
she looked at me , a queer light in her brilliant blue eyes .
i arranged the rug over her and she wished me good night .
what will you do , louise ?
i see i see well , my friend , do what i have asked of you .
he asked , handing over the completed epistle .
arbuthnot considered for a moment or two .
and yet ive got just the right kind of umbrella .
she ought never to have come .
but i have worked for the last two years amongst the cannibal tribes in the interior of east africa .
theres no reason aunt jane !
as long as you practise your breathing , all will be well with you .
yesi am here .
its been a different someone in each story ive been told .
he turned up so suddenly and unexpectedly , didnt he ?
from last night till eleven this morning i had been safe , but now the net was closing in upon me .
it is necessary to go into everything , monsieur , said poirot , turning to him .
anything further i can do for you ?
west africa , lance had said .
his health has always been good .
or he could have slipped in whilst you were out shutting up the ducks .
i think its hair oil .
you cant do that .
weve got to get at more of her background .
she had felt first , when introduced into the unit , a blinding panic , a horrible feeling of imprisonment and frustration , and the fact that the imprisonment was camouflaged in circumstances of luxury had somehow made it seem all the more horrible to her .
i wont go near a doctor !
i didnt help her .
i cant help it .
the olive branch , she said .
he talked freely and at length without much modulation and managing miraculously not to repeat himself too often .
already she was sure of it .
these weighty matters , and the question of wine , settled , mr .
this was what i longed for .
it took place some years ago .
no point on a chart indicated by a skull and crossbones , no directions like four paces to the left , west by north .
well , may have been , i suppose .
supposing that alfred lee is tired of dancing attendance upon an exacting taskmaster .
yes , i do feel rather hungry .
im often the same .
that , excuse me , is not true , madame .
gerald is a dear , but hes desperately poorthough hes a very clever engineer ; and if only he had a little capital , his firm would take him into partnership .
bringing some tame doctor , too , i understand he added .
johnson or miss blighwhichever you call her well , of course , shes always nellie bligh to me .
tommy paced it uncertainly , tuppence interrupting with a cry of warning as she realised that the fourth step left would take him slap against the wall .
joanna , maids have days out once a week , dont they ?
i mean about the robbery .
i just brought it along today for you to see .
you know best , he said .
i did not quite follow his reasoning , but i merely asked how he proposed to find the girl .
did you manage to get into normas room , or wherever you really wanted to go ?
shes devoted to the childcant do enough for her .
poirot said : but i am seriousyes .
oh , the whole party .
bingo did it she said in a strained whisper .
i can assure you that i didnt put he stopped suddenly and then went onstrychnine in aunt emilys soup .
he takes the harmless alkaloid , and it turns out to be harmful after all .
in the end , of course , you track down the person in questionits often someone extremely unlikely , and thats that .
because he never went near the study !
it was stifling .
stealing our tennis racquets , i suppose , said julia with sarcasm .
know all , how much exactly do you know ?
upward , he took on something terrible .
he read a good deal .
she was absolutely sweet about it allbut then she would be .
harper took the small object in his hand .
he said : come , vanda .
find out what everyone was doing from nine-thirty onwards .
tuppence looked complacent .
cried julius .
raikes was the man who might marry your niece , and with you dead , your niece would inherit a very handsome income , even though you had prudently arranged that she could not touch the principal .
i have every reason to believe so .
whats up , luke ?
and you have been married how long ?
the name of it ought to have given the show away .
she had no suspicion , i think , that i had any wish for the information apart from beingwell , rather muddleheaded , elderly , and very worried about where my parcel of worn clothes had gone .
we are therefore forced to the conclusion that the murderer is to be found among the occupants of one particular coachthe stamboul-calais coach .
the morning coffees were just getting under way .
only miss sally .
to be careful ?
in the west indies , she added .
i was supposed to be dead too ; let it remain at that .
and suddenly , from the past , a fleeting memory came to aid her understanding .
oh i never think of them like that !
all the rest of it .
vera said angrily : i was nowhere near the woman !
she said , how do you like your relations ?
that is why , poirot , i have come to you .
some peoplesome people are like leeches !
miss veronica cray , the motion picture actress .
the whole of doncaster , police and civilians , will be out to catch one manand with reasonable luck , we ought to get him !
i was always to knock when introducing visitorsbusiness visitors , that is , he added .
the way you say thingsthe things you sayiive never met anyone the least like you .
miss marple , being old-fashioned , preferred her newspapers to be newspapers and give you news .
his clothes hung loosely on his shrunken form .
at first he had taken her to be english .
i ran straight out of the room .
suddenly tommy gave an exclamation .
i was in the pavilion and i shot john , thats what you mean ?
her eyes rested thoughtfully on poirot for a minute , then they went to the tall , square-shouldered figure in the well-cut tweeds .
please go on , said kay .
i insist upon it .
poirot looked up after them , then turned to encounter miss brewis moving fast , and clasping papers .
you know where we are ?
shed go mad if she had time to brood on what shed done .
sheshe will go on believing that imsane .
the countesss eyes opened wide .
bridget shook her head .
he rose from his chair .
i was with chief inspector kemp when the question of interviewing your daughter came up .
thats what made me so very angry , if you can understand , my dear .
are you a girl , or a witch ?
are you staying in london long ?
i stared at her , rather taken aback .
so i would have breakfast down in the restaurant , and i would have everything that was on the menu .
already he had recovered that iron calm of his .
he knew some of his passengers on this flight but not all of them .
i have known her , my dear mrs .
had i really thought it was ?
asked tommy , as he came downstairs .
i knew !
he was emphatically not of the stuff of which successful criminals are made .
he gave you just that feeling of assuranceof confidencethat a doctor ought to give .
i suppose , i said , that is because i have rather a roman nose .
i dont think its my attractive appearancethey must think i know something .
he looked at her half mockingly , half with some other emotion .
but of course , i know about you .
why does it come to me ?
a rather rakish-looking brunette with the kind of hairdo that suggested shed been out in a blizzard lately .
guthrie got up , put on a pair of spectacles , and went over to study the picture .
after bowing his guest out , poirot returned to his armchair and smiled at me .
she counted .
it isnt very like oliver , she admitted , and i couldnt get any clippings of his hair .
some of them are much better than others .
you are letting her go ?
since the man who had been murdered had been fully dressed and stabbed with a dagger , i objected .
a little brandy , suggested mr .
your aunt may live for years , probably will .
without a word she turned away .
all genuine too , arent they ?
and the director ?
i know them fairly well now and i have learnt to appreciate donaldsonhis clarity of vision and the deep , underlying force and humanity of the man .
the emirs car has just arrived to call for her .
yes , it was interesting .
i ought to , oughtnt i ?
treves shrewdly .
but she did not concoct it .
yes , youre quite right .
but that was a good long time ago , you know .
well , not quite like that .
her unhappy eyes met mine .
you must give her back , said sybil .
that is why as long as i live i can never go back to charnley .
she got there at a quarter to nine , left at half past eleven and got back here at a quarter to twelve .
oh you startled me , i thought satipy , said renisenb .
i think cairo is worse than anyplace now .
is this the result of enchantment ?
miss waynflete wore a straw hat and , to bridgets amusement , had put on gloves .
he was in high good-humour .
there was a war on !
lancaster , is now ?
in another minute , she was out of the door .
im not so sure that i do myself .
but i must say richard amory cant be a very bright sort of chap .
he ran towards her and evelyn followed him .
(japp would tell you the same , hastings .
he didnt look that kind of man , i said , casting my mind back .
reckon there wouldnt be much for a burglar to take up at long meadows , said mrs .
they saw us and jenny waved a hand .
then how do you know that what nurse whats her-name said mightnt have been the truth ?
hardman reflected a minute or two .
it was with a little shock of surprise that she found herself set down to a small table with , opposite her , the same woman who had been her vis--vis in the pullman .
she is not satisfied ; no , she is not satisfied at all .
of course i love you .
allerton had still not come back .
he stroked the neck of his favourite hunter , had a word with the groom , then he went to the home farm and had a chat with the farmers wife .
buy british was ever aunt emilys motto .
her eyes , he noticed , were shrewd and knowledgeable .
my wife had turned towards the table and was just picking up her glass .
the devenishes are getting a divorce .
ferguson stepped back a pace .
poor leo staverton broke his neck in the hunting field and hes all done up in plasterthat cant be it .
tie a large knot and begin .
battle and a subordinate were at the telephone .
they were also experts in training a raw girl , the inevitable result being that the raw girl , once trained , departed somewhere where her newly-acquired knowledge commanded a more substantial remuneration than the archdeacons meagre purse allowed .
it was something you said .
that must be iteh , dont you think so , entwhistle ?
nothing but fruit .
whatdisappeared from a respectable west end hotel ?
i have been round the garden with them sometimes , trying to identify certain parts of it he had particularly loved , though it is not always easy because of the way things have grown up .
and supposing its all a mares nest ?
i didnt quite understand the tone in his voice , but i answered promptly enough .
well , there wasnt a secret drawer .
and oh , i do hope and pray that nothing has happened to that dear sweet old thingall her faculties still and everything .
he stretched out a hand towards her .
all the same i can try .
but reallyin this case miss marple shook her head .
didnt you take your jewellery or a fur-coat ?
it was just concerning a remark that your daughter made at the party .
i expect she enjoyed the sensation .
anyway , shes got something .
i wont pretend there is butbut i should like to have a chat with you .
i cant do anything unless i feel very , very warm .
peter lord said : it helps some people to pretend that sort of thing to themselves .
the nurse threw him a grateful glance and went on .
i am not yet prepared to have knowledge of this place broadcast to the globe .
tea ?
the reviews on publication were even more enthusiastic than the pre-publication reports .
the passport descriptions of olive betterton and hilary craven were almost identical , but actually the two faces were entirely different .
this proceeded for some time , every now and then rising heatedly , until i hushed him down .
you see where i am arriving ?
craddock crumpled up the message and threw it into the wastepaper basket .
she and another player opposite staked simultaneously , she on six , he on five .
what sort of things did they ask you ?
well , she wrote to the fortune-teller at mrs .
frankie felt very sorry for him .
ratchett was cassetti , the armstrong murderer .
in _num_ black coffee was the first of her plays to be novelised by another author , charles osborne .
also , she was an earnest woman , and she could not help asking herself what possible good these young people would ever do in the world without early rising .
his manner took on a new authority .
seventeen or eighteen i suppose .
but that was not all .
mr pearson returned to town somewhat annoyed , as he had no idea where the chinaman proposed to stay .
well have him in here , sir , if you dont mind .
no luxuries here , and deirdre , who loved comfort as a cat loves cream , shivered a little .
there entered a little elderly , dried-up man and a fresh-coloured , boyish young man .
shed thought of them as brown but they were black , and there was something curiously impenetrable about black eyes .
the mans quite presentable .
middletons bank , _num_ high street , st .
dont know as i ever laid eyes on her myself .
my god , the shortsightedness of our people !
exactly , i cried eagerly .
there was a dutchman and his wife whom he had not met before , since they had only just taken up their appointment .
hark !
kettering to come here this morning , continued the magistrate , though really i doubt if we have much to ask him , but there are one or two suspicious circumstances he paused , rubbing his nose .
she had already read it carefully , but now she looked over it once more to refresh her memory .
did miss arundell say anything to indicate that miss lawson knew that a will was being drawn in her favour ?
oh , thats different .
you want me to save him for youis that it ?
what a mass of nerves the woman is .
put as delicately as possible , his opinion amounted to this : if poirot , the unique poirot , had failed , was it likely that i should succeed ?
she said : edward !
nothing more to explain ?
agreeable woods , handsome residences .
one would hardly think a young man of that type would have thehow do you say itthe bowels to commit such a crime .
laurence brown ?
we dream of fantastic things that may never happen .
of course , all that we were told is very interesting , said miss marple , rather doubtfully .
was it that day ?
it was then , messieurs , that he came south .
poirot said thoughtfully : he was taken ill , of course , very suddenlyvery suddenly indeed .
tommy suspected her father , the saturnine m .
he could be sorry , and was sorry , for olga seminoff though he was quite unaffected by the passionate arguments she advanced for herself .
i mean , it works it out like perspiration .
it showed me that miss sainsbury seale was the beginning and middle and end of the case .
old pussies , but definitely not stay-at-home old pussies .
johnson if youll give me her address , and just ask if its all right to keep it .
that is failing badly .
well , it is difficult to explain .
shed take something for a headache now and again , sir .
sir guy de chevenix went on the first crusade .
cried mr hardman .
nowhere instead of somewhere yes , of course , that must be it .
children are a terrible expense .
dont they , old thing ?
at about you ?
from you ?
he should have been here by now , but doubtless he has lingered on the way .
even now , by the time he had left mirelles flat , he had cooled down .
twelve two elderly men sat together in a room whose furnishings were of the most modern kind .
csars wife is bespattered with it .
oh , i cant bear to think of it .
but they couldnt fool me .
asked tuppence sharply .
) colonel arbuthnotbritish subject .
finally , at poirots request , he pressed a spring in the wall , a panel slid aside , and a short passage led us into the priests hole .
all that is finished !
hot coffee .
well go into that presently .
im sure im never ill-natured , said jennifer .
but does it matter taking risks ?
although the weather was perfectly smooth , it was feared that the unfortunate gentleman must have fallen overboard .
poirot came to her rescue .
thought i might just look you up .
youve met one of em , i hear .
beatrice , he thought , had opened it .
of course it doesit must .
the second doctor had pro-pounded a somewhat alarmist view , namely that my father suffered from a kidney disease .
i didnt have time to answer .
surely you ought to warn me ?
my poor emily !
but when we got heresheshe was herewaiting .
a little cryalmost a moancame from her .
do you think you could go out and buy me a pistol , stevens ?
funny , went on mrs .
he opened a desk drawer .
she was honest , but she liked to know about things .
disappointed suitors dont go about stabbing people in the back and poisoning them .
if underhay is alive and comes to read about itwell , he may come forward .
that is curious , said fournier thoughtfully .
she found lady tressilian looking white and shaken .
yes , indeed , madame .
and if you ask me , mr .
miss amy carnaby fell back , her hand went to her ample breast .
by the pricking of my thumbs postern of fate memoirs an autobiography come , tell me how you live credits cover newspaper print and texture by shutterstock author photograph christie archives trust copyright this book is a work of fiction .
he said hoarsely : all right thenill tell you .
they might think id bumped old strange off .
dont you fret yourself .
fancy her lighting upon that !
not a jew either .
a camera man came next .
i was so worked up .
i mean , you know so much about police work and procedure .
poirot , as far as he was able to in his crippled state , made a gesture of supreme disdain .
bruce macpherson was one , and the other was colin macdonald .
ellie adored riding and she too was troubled by an allergy .
is that you , m .
i mean this may have been a story hes been telling to people for years .
i had them in my hand and then brian called out his engine had got caught , and i ran out and what with one thing and another i must have just stuffed them in somewhere stupid .
theres something here that none of you know about , he said .
her voice was faint and fluttery .
curtin drew back rather unwillingly .
the whole setup at the pale horse was bogus !
to malaya , said poirot .
she said in her most righteous voice : we must all be brave , mustnt we ?
her hands continued to twitch .
strictly between you and me i think half these fellows are slightly barmy themselves .
did you think i had done it , then ?
he was in a tight corner , a very tight corner , threatened with ruin .
vegetarians always do .
it looked bleak and grey now with the half-denuded trees swaying in the wind .
no , it went to irisa trust fund .
no place like doverton kingsbourne .
for ritual .
craddock inoculated for typhoid before going to egypt ?
he thought that she was , like many women of the same type , women who were often magistrates , or who ran councils or charities , or interested themselves in what used to be called good works .
i dont know much about the family , he went on in a casual tone .
i wonder why you ever try .
the woman who came daily to clean and cook for the beroldys was surprised to find the door of the apartment standing wide open .
thought shed got it wrong .
chapter _num_ i sir claud amorys house , abbots cleve , stood just on the outskirts of the small town or rather overgrown village of market cleve , about twenty-five miles south-east of london .
she leant forward .
he took the paper to the window .
the next morning she had various matters to see to in the town .
an old-fashioned birthday book .
a few months ago i noticed an advertisement in the papers , and it seemed to me that the child in question must be our magdalen .
it is very intriguing .
he wanted to talkwell , then , let him talk .
he may have effected the exchange some days ago .
she was observant .
any stomach can be trained .
who lived thereor who lives there now ?
id hate to teach in a school .
i daresay youre right .
after waiting on her guest , mrs .
if you knew as much as i do about doctors never mind about the doctors , said tommy , you do as i tell you .
julia walked slowly in the direction of the sports pavilion .
olga , her cheek pillowed on a long , slender hand , watched him with unfathomable eyes .
yet i was convinced that she did know a great deal more than any of us , and held some clue to the affair of which we were absolutely ignorant .
the dirty murdering scoundrels from mrs .
we hadnt actually .
rosalie said .
no , she said slowly .
hercule poirot thought suddenly that he looked rather like a contented pig .
we had been very silent .
i stole a small quantity of this drug and kept it by me .
poirot and the commissary , who were both present , greeted me respectively with a smile and a polite bow .
those fingerprints arent the prints of anybody connected with the case !
because you didnt know how much i knewand where i obtained that knowledge .
he will be free in about ten minutes if that will be all right ?
did you know dr .
frankie had a qualm of doubt .
de saint alard who killed my son .
just the younger lot whom he could never keep clear in his mind and who just thought of him as a butler whod been there a long time .
what was the matter with tommy ?
iv once again hercule poirot encountered the shrewd penetrating glance of miss williams , and once again felt the years falling away and himself a meek and apprehensive little boy .
good night , mrs lennox .
roberts slowly .
miss marple took a sip of tea .
i dont see how you can get away from the text of that letter .
i used to sail quite a bit as a boy .
sergeant lake was in a chair by the window overlooking the lake .
poison .
lady astwell heaved a sigh of reminiscence .
sorry , said dennis .
iv as they went down the stairs again to no .
quite soit didnt worry me .
horrible judas , she thought .
she kind of felt if we had a little place of our ownsomething smallit would make all the difference .
he was vaguely disappointed .
theres no question of suicide , i suppose ?
butim not surehow can i be ?
you want me tohush it up , then ?
it might be possible , you know .
if he threw away all his little pillboxes and went out for a good ten-mile walk every day hed be a different man .
they were going to call it anna the adventuressas silly a title as i had ever heard , i thought ; though i kept my mouth shut , because , after all , they were willing to pay me _num_ , and though i might have certain feelings about the title of a book , nobody could be bothered about the title of a serial in a newspaper .
a very dangerous woman .
i am looking at it from the outside point of view .
her eyes passed round the room .
miss le couteau !
im sure he hadnt got an enemy in the world .
poirot said : did you have any conversation with her at all that afternoon ?
she sat up and pressed her handkerchief to her eyes .
im going to have he broke off .
youre being watched and spied upon in just the same wayor worse ?
its used to it .
oh , of course , said miss marple , theres noise everywhere , isnt there ?
that is so , monsieur , said the conductor .
she turned to him obediently .
there was a small wall safe in the corner .
geraldine said : we dont really want her .
ive got a lot to dolondon , and my young man .
shes always been good to me .
quite impossible , i should say .
terrible about mrs .
you mean people are fighting shy of having their teeth attended to by a possible murderer ?
that he was very rich , said miss marple immediately .
that in no possible way could mrs .
janes got luck , said mrs .
i shouldnt like my conjectures to be written down and quoted against me .
the landladys brow cleared .
im a coward , she said , her eyes still cast down .
inspector neele paid no attention .
without a word sir henry left the room and walked into the kitchen .
i never trust the children .
but a crooked little builder isnt what im after .
' you mean - alone ?
in factwell , shes a corker .
doctors had always been taken for granted .
harry lee seemed in very good spirits , sir .
we had better speak english .
he had a very high opinion of you .
i should have chosen a less public moment , he said .
with the superintendent actually in the house , his lever over the guilty person would have been much stronger .
that makes the task harder , he observed .
i am afraid it is not easy to get a first novel accepted , so you mustnt be disappointed .
thered been stories about him already .
i laid the girl on the sofa there , with a cushion under her head , and then hurried out into the hall in search of the telephone .
sybil sighed pleasurably .
what do you call it on the radio ?
there are all sorts of people going in and out all the time .
he looked just the same as ever , impassive , formal and unemotional .
he ought to have been back hours ago .
you just want to know .
that gives either of those two a possible motive .
her voice was very deepa full contralto .
spence once said , i think these people are a lot of ruddy crooks .
he looked the picture of misery .
i know , said the duchess grimly .
you were quite right , she said .
whats he like ?
i think deborah might like to have this , she said , and the florentine set .
it ought to be abolished by act of parliament .
she died of six times the maximum dose of a substance whose official name i will not try to pronounce but which i understand is generally known as calmo .
more interested in her own doings , she was .
i would not like to say either way im sure .
david hunter opened it .
hubbards sister really work for you ?
but just look at that key , sir .
the three houses in the higher crescent were out of it .
men get killed and nobody mindsi mean , nobody except their wives and sweethearts and children and things like that .
why in the world i ever took this job on !
anthonys voice rang out sharply .
its no use forgetting .
she gave it to annette and watched her drink it with an expression that i could not fathom .
a look of faint amusement showed in miss cunninghams pale blue eyes .
a childs doll that held within its skin a handful of diamondsthe proceeds of crime .
the maid telephoned for him .
money usually comes in .
i have something to say and all the house should hear it .
they were all young men of super physique .
i did likewise , and we drove up within three minutes of each other .
one person was unable to attend the party .
he would only repeat his statement about the unlimited power at the disposal of the big four , and his assurance of the vengeance which would follow if he talked .
nicholas ransom and mr .
come , signor ascanio , you visited the dead man on the tuesday morningthat is so , is it not ?
in the doorway of the house a white-capped maidservant was standing , almost speechless with indignation .
marina gregg came back on the set yesterdayand she created something frightful .
they then went into the question of the food eaten by mrs waverly on the night of the _num_ th .
but i think she must like me now because she says she embroidered it all with her own hands .
miss howard , i explained .
johnson , the police constable , with his coat off , digging .
possibly once they had discovered that i had spotted him , they would have put someone else on my tracksomeone whom i might not recognize .
whatever can it be ?
it would also make the room look lower , and i liked low rooms .
i was under the misconception , induced by the visual evidence , that mrs .
you did not believe yourself in your wifes danger .
dont look .
ask me all over again about everything .
and being a woman of decision , she straightway ordered out the hispano suiza .
they were bad sailors and retired immediately to the ladies saloon to lay themselves down , close their eyes and hope to get across the intervening water to france without the worst happening .
oliver , cautiously .
the panel opened , and the body of oliver costello slumped down and fell forward .
gladys is a very conscientious girl .
how rotten for you .
at the moment we know something that nobody else does .
she followed the other passengers across to where the aircraft was waiting .
what goes on there ?
again miss gorringe reassured him .
she frowned with the effort of thought .
ginger , with the almost terrifying efficiency which she was able to display when it suited her , had briefed me by telephone .
if madame found it , she might incriminate herself by trying to get rid of it .
tell them to leave the room , said harry .
mrs boyntons basilisk eyes looked , not at sarah , but oddly over her shoulder .
oh , and oxford was the one that smashed , was it ?
or rawlinson passed it to someone on his way to the airstrip .
perhaps one does imagine things .
parbleu , we go and see m .
rightly so , perhaps , who knows ?
i told evans to bring round the ford .
but here ann got a surprise .
all the same , it gave you an ides , didn ' t it ?
why shouldnt we say what we think ?
if it was put through from here , i dont see how anyone else but parker could have sent it .
gone a bit gaga as they say , sir , suggested inspector jameson .
her cheeks were flushed with excitement and had been ever since colonel easterbrook had handed her a small box of sweets and declaimed with a bow , sweets to the sweet !
hercule poirot replied dreamily : i have employed the castanets of bronze .
i discarded a tile .
if they rang for the lift , that buzzer would go perhaps as i was bringing them down .
suppose colonel protheroe turns round and says hell have the law on her .
she didnt understand it really herself .
on the desk was the picture of a young man in uniformjeremys son antony , killed in the war .
but marina gregg was not looking at the woman .
youd say , i suppose , that that was natural enough in a house where thered been a funeral that day .
i never shot at him .
we want something like a womans hatpins .
rather apologetically , bobby put his hand into the dead mans pocket and , drawing out a silk handkerchief , he spread it reverently over the dead face .
warm for the time of year today .
you were just getting into a big car .
i guessed that .
we have checked up on those there are .
reddings house for either of those two .
we women are good observers , you think ?
poirot , i didnt ask you to come here in the first place poirot interrupted .
the rain came , and , as is customary in that country , firm going at _num_ .
then he looked at the man whom the note introduced to him .
that oughtnt to be difficult .
what do you cloades think rosaleen isa milch cow ?
but surely i know what youre going to say .
tiredness swept over her as it seemed to do rather more frequently than formerly , which she said to herself was possibly a result of concussion .
groves ?
madame trusted me .
somewhere around the table a chair was pushed sharply back and then drawn in again .
it is perhaps the property of m .
he got into touch with me and explained what he wanted me to do .
i wanted an excuse to speak to you .
yes , weve found a clue , stoddart-west echoed .
as i saw a faint smile gather on mrs .
no , sir , nor likely to .
she was curious about the lady in the mink coat , and looked up at the windows of her compartment .
its all arranged , said elsie .
she marked off on a calendar the day when the moon would be full , and on that night she had both the nurse and then george into her room and made them study the wallpaper carefully .
partridge looked a little annoyed at being interrupted .
he recalled a charming freckled face , a sofa with broken springs , a large quantity of dogs , and other things both agreeable and disagreeable .
leo said coldly : my son told you , when you arrested him , that he had been given a lift that night .
his eye sought mr .
we didnt say our house but we knew thats what we meant .
that ass jimmy got off with the wrong car .
the newspapers bring it up from time to time , said mayhew .
he was enslaved body and soul by his new possession .
but im not obliged to believe that story .
on her way up to bed , lucy encountered cedric on the stairs .
not exactly forging , is it ?
i stood there , thinking .
people are not responsible for their actions in the least .
pardonstenger is at home , madam , said the butler .
leidner might be a mental case .
there was only one person who could have laid it and that did not make senseor did it ?
it must have been just before nine oclock .
poirot , tomorrow is a long way off .
well , thats all for the present , mrs hailsham-brown .
you know exactly what i mean , said miss marple .
fourthly , would you like to come round and hear what the taxi driver says .
well , really dear , said miss marple , in the same way one always has known everything .
thats always the excuse nowadays .
im sure you wont mind .
i made up my mind and attacked .
oh , but he did , said evelyn hillingdon .
and yet , said lance , id almost dare to swear that theres a mackenzie in our midst .
you set your spies to follow meto hound me downyou plotted against me .
they raced up the stairs and round the bend , past a recess with statues gleaming white and eerie , and along the straight passage to simeon lees door .
she tossed her head and giggled and passed it off .
she had quite forgotten her first distrust now , and was speaking eagerly .
i must look him up .
leonie threw him a coquettish glance .
how unbelievably stupid of himwhen he had the key in his pocket all the time !
yes , i see her side of it .
v the following evening , at dinner , every passenger found a typewritten slip by his plate requesting him to be in the main lounge at _num_ .
rhoda disappeared into the kitchen .
or the other womanmrs .
haymes didnt lock that door ?
but one finds it very hard to work , i think , unless one does get into a mess .
gold behaved very well .
miss marple was looking particularly woolly and fluffya picture of a sweet old lady .
shes got the pistol in her right hand .
throwing her mothers secret cache of drink overboard .
something scientific that they can get their teeth into .
hed never heard of peterfield or of the gun .
poirot had wandered over to the window .
dont take too many , for gods sake , marina .
allen or the gentleman ?
the least you can do is to show friendliness and extend hospitality .
we are in the condition of people holding a sance .
when the tirade was over they had arrived at the hotel landing stage .
see ?
cried fenella , that must be it !
i was surprised to see ruth in the room .
i mean , theres no real time involved .
hes an obstruction in the way of progress and hes got to be removed .
listen , said mr .
and theres nothing shed stick atabsolutely nothing !
you dont think emily stopped .
it isnt true , you know .
starkwedder nodded .
youve nothing on me .
into darkness .
so charlotte fisher came to be my secretary and mary fisher came as a help in trouble when necessary , and they remained with me as friend and secretary and governess and dogsbody and everything else for many years .
and then and then mrs .
the return of the proper occupants of the carriage put an end to this diversion .
my head was aching badly , and the terror of my nights dreams was still upon me .
after dinner , lady stubbs goes early to bedbut miss brewis caught a glimpse of her slipping out of the house a short while afterwards .
this is just a working hypothesis .
said porter , i begin to understand .
it was here , so tradition had it , that the witches had held revelry on walpurgis night and halloween .
satterthwaite was pulling on his gloves .
it didnt really take much deciding .
she did not look in the sitting-room , then ?
come on , get your things on .
you took those emeralds round to bond street to old greatorex ?
i believe it would be better if you received her alone .
then , at a movement behind him , harry broke off his laugh and turned sharply .
photographs , too .
but its the main idea .
it satisfies some urge , i suppose .
hester came flying down them .
this arrangement will suit us both perfectly .
i liked it .
theyre all cuckoo round here .
to begin with i did breakfast in the morning as well , but nurse , once she was sure that her status as a hospital-nurse-who-did-no-work-in-the-house was not assailed , declared herself willing to deal with breakfast herself .
the room was exactly as bundle had seen it before , with the seven chairs grouped round the table .
betterton laughed again , confidently .
she hurried towards it down a narrow passageway , heard a footstep behind her , half turned , when she was struck from behind and the world went up in sparks .
why not add one more anonymous letter , and frighten the girl out of the place ?
victoria sat next to her on the aisle .
she had just brought in some washing which she was putting away in the chest of drawers .
say ten minutes , she whispered .
he had no idea that today would decide his future once and for all .
madeleine smiled .
hed outgrown his usefulness as a gardener , though his wife managed to make herself useful up at the house .
now the reason that presents itself most naturally to the imagination is that he has suddenly met someone whom he desires to marry .
i like my duties clearly defined .
but you can guess !
well , my dear aunt , if you will have it , i fancied i saw himthe man in the picture , i meanlooking out of the end window when i was coming up the drive last night .
later , the inspector telephones that hes bringing everyone there .
roses , said sir charles .
theres a lot of horse-play goes onit maynt have been serious or fatal .
good-bye for the moment .
i shouldnt give any interviews if i were you .
the one that miss howard exactly , said john , with rather unnecessary abruptness .
he incites them to mischief often enough .
and yet hed seemed almost himself a week ago .
he said politely : may i come in , madame ?
five pounds is pretty good , isnt it ?
the money spent must have been fantastic .
revel , he said at last , with a good deal of significance in his manner .
the facts seemed more to suggest that oneor possibly twomembers of the family had acted in collusion and that the others were accessories after the fact .
she spoke thoughtfully .
ive a soft heart for a romance myself , and i do say and i always have said that its hard for a man whos got a wife in an asylum to be tied all his life with nothing but death that can free him .
you know , he couldnt pass an exam and things at the earlier school he was atprep school or something .
and dont scream or faint or anything .
the tigris was just a mile away , and on the great mound of the acropolis , big stone assyrian heads poked out of the soil .
the doctor shot a keen glance at poirot .
the responsibility isnt mine , madam , he said .
you mustnt do that sort of thing , iris .
but to tuppences surprise jane shook her head .
he did not , however , go to bed .
barron ?
the chief constable transferred his gaze .
you think it could have happened just as i say ?
as you saya regrettable failure to employ order and method in the mental processes , and without order and method , hastings quite so , i interrupted hastily .
he passed his hand over his forehead .
but , of course , when he was so stern about concealing things , i thought of this at once .
at any minute the patient may return to his full powers .
i thought i wouldnt see you again for years , and when i did see you , youd have forgotten all about me .
major horton said : getting on for lunchtime ?
you see , if im right in my mind that someone wanted to prevent your coming to chimneys , the reason seems to lie in your knowing herzoslovakia .
she was proud .
however , i disposed of him quite easily .
vera said urgently : if you didnt find him last night , you wont find him now thats common sense .
what enthusiasm !
i offered him my handkerchief , which he accepted with fervent protestations of thanks .
the box slid open .
you killed her !
orourkes room move .
renisenb demanded : did my father ask you what you thought about nofrets death ?
its tempting , i agree , said dermot craddock , but i think youll have to banish that rosy picture from your mind , frank .
then well have it out .
most particular , he was , that i should tell him exactly what i thought about it all .
it was the first time she had ever heard yahmose utter a sentence containing criticism of imhotep .
i did cast languishing eyes on a handful of bronzed middle-aged colonels , but most of these were already attached to attractive married womenthe wives of other menand had no interest in young and insipid girls .
the letters just confirmed that belief .
said fenella , in an odd tone of voice .
no possible suspicion could attach to richard knighton .
youll notice , m .
i ' m sitting in my room next door to this .
they were sent for a purpose , certainly , i said grimly .
anne smiled a little as she said : only a vase of chrysanthemums that badly wanted their water changed .
miss ackroyd has asked me to investigate the death of her uncle .
pierrot and pierrette grown old and grey sit in front of the fire in two armchairs .
the new lady westholme lived entirely in tweeds and stout brogues , bred dogs , bullied the villagers and forced her husband pitilessly into public life .
a mere incident first drew my attention to it .
old-fashioned .
tea is not one of my favourite meals but i appreciated the smoky china tea , and the delicate cups in which it was served .
my brother reproached me several times with not taking more interest in the family business , now that i had come in with him .
and there were people coming up the staircase ?
he spoke kindly but firmly .
see you tonight .
youd better talk to her yourself .
leadbetter felt indignant to think that anyone could sleep with such a drama as not a sparrow going on .
what on earth induced you to bring over that little austrian to talk to me ?
tannoy going full steam ahead .
im determined to marry her .
at least , she added under her breath and touching one of the amulets she wore , i hope so .
obeying his first impulse , burgess rushed out into the street and fetched the nearest policeman .
i see what youre getting at , sir rowland said , nodding his head slowly .
it is not a pretty action that you attribute there to her husband the good doctor , said poirot severely .
finally , the crowning glory , the beech treethe biggest tree in the garden , with a pleasant shedding of beechnuts which i ate with relish .
sarah nodded .
naturally , he was ready to go quite off the deep end about that .
getting perhaps a bit long in the tooth .
i do prefer it .
jane , more beautiful (if that were possible) off the stage than on , opened enormous blue eyes and murmured at discreet intervals : really ?
constantine dubiously .
miss marple asked .
philip lombard , that upon a date in february , _num_ , you were guilty of the death of twenty-one men , members of an east african tribe .
were in the daily period .
i met another nurse , and asked about her .
she looked more than ever , mrs .
she was leaning forward .
in that case , where were you and what were you doing ?
they added that they were the solicitors to the late mr .
tuppence sat silent for a moment , then she leapt to her feet and rushed to the window .
i was attempting to discuss with him the sensational news of the dayno less than an attempted assassination of mr .
a reason that , by all i have heard , he smiled , will appeal to m .
you wont take my hint that ive got a trump card up my sleeve ?
babbington was still living in loomouth .
as you please , said mary .
he leant right over .
you say you didnt know i was there .
that grey thing is the same model that gladys cooper wore in palm trees in egypt .
a practical advantage does not seem to arise either .
oh , dont , said anne .
carrington drew a deep breath .
but its an awful temptation to be a bully , especially if people wont stand up to you .
his eyes darted round , taking in the scene .
jonathan , speaking of julietno juliet hereunless perhaps one could imagine juliet a survivorliving on , deprived of romeowas it not an essential part of juliets makeup that she should die young ?
the last part of that answer is to be struck out .
certainly i will take it .
but it is a very important question , iris .
blatts .
oh , how should i know , said julia .
it seems to me it all happened a long time ago .
we decided then and thereperhaps we were madi dont knowthat the sentence of death that cassetti had escaped had got to be carried out .
ex-inspector blore said : eh , my lad , thats the question !
your father accepted that theory , gwennie , mainly , i should imagine , for your sake .
quin , noncommittally .
it wasnt as thoughi mean , well , it was like this .
dermot craddock said thoughtfully , an odd place to choose .
all the others mr .
my grandfather give me things to bring here .
i went back to my tent and read for about twenty-five minutes .
it makes me shiver still to think of it .
she went out one night walking in her sleep and had an accident , falling down a portion of the cliff to which a pathway which had been discarded appeared to lead .
shes a canadian , came over here in the war and met bland .
brooding does , you know .
most entertaining fellow , can tell you lots of good stories .
when bill finally paused for breath and sympathy , bundle said : youre quite right , bill , its a rotten shame .
the rapture of reunion with edward had come and gone .
and betterton was one of the splitters in chief !
it endshere , said mr .
but in that case , why was the face disfigured ?
you drank in your coffee a preparation of indian hemp .
whats intellectual work compared to a chef doeuvre like delicious death ?
she was a free woman .
you see , do you not , hastings , that that fact has got to be explained ?
let us , then , proceed .
anyone bear out his statement ?
he looked at me piteously .
esther lee had been seen going up towards the woods that morning .
moreover , miss marple , so it seemed , believed in the accuracy of her friends story and he knew all about miss marple .
_num_ into the gothic gloom of the library , gina brought an exotic glow .
com visit www .
then , when he is ungrateful , she is deeply wounded and says her heart is brokenuntil the next gloomy young man comes along , which is usually about three weeks later !
can you tell me first whos been in and out of this room this evening ?
poirot , you are rightunconsciously that may be true .
her fingers , deft and white , dealt with the ritual of coffee making , with some slight aid from nurse craven .
charles came up to standard .
ive run out .
you are quite right , said the commissary .
it might have been tonytony hawker .
if i find out from him why the dogs didnt eat the palms of jezebels hands , will you tell me about those letters ?
tommy sighed and brought the tips of his fingers together in the most approved sherlock holmes fashion .
hes not asleep !
that child near us , doubtless she too has dreamt of coming abroadof the excitementof how different everything would be .
well , hurry up , growled conrad .
its difficult to say how much offhand celia said eagerly , let me give you a cheque for what you think roughly and then you find out from people and i can take some back or give you more .
was it going to be all right ?
so many other things to remember : walking up through a carpet of flowers to the yezidis shrine at sheikh adithe beauty of the great tiled mosques of isfahana fairy-story citya red sunset outside the house at nimrudgetting out of the train at the cilician gates in the hush of eveningthe trees of the new forest in autumnswimming in the sea in torbay with rosalindmathew playing in the eton and harrow matchmax arriving home from the war and eating kippers with meso many thingssome silly , some funny , some beautiful .
then there was sir georges secretary , henry thompson .
stop , young man , sir rowland ordered .
im glad you like it , said hilary .
the victim wouldnt even cry out .
there seems no possible reason .
gerry left a letter .
then she had thanked mrs .
to begin with , she had no illusions about charles .
why , he cried , i thought youd left us .
asked edward .
it depends on who has reason to gain by your death , said miss marple .
well , i dont think it is the little girl .
i might have disappointed him .
there , that is better , yes ?
geoffrey has thata blind understanding .
her curiosity was now aroused .
the false shaista could , of course , have killed miss springer but she could not have killed miss vansittart or mademoiselle blanche , and would have had no motive to kill anybody , nor was such a thing required of her .
but he wished that miss oscar were here .
/mrs .
that is all i want to know .
another question was what had induced lord edgware suddenly to change his mind and agree to a divorce ?
but how british .
she went into the batteryi was going on when her cry called me back .
but his story seemed straightforward enough .
they required a certain amount of knowledge but not a great deal .
he got very worked up , she smiled faintly .
she was not feeling well , and was staying in bed with a miserable headache .
my father-in-laws heart was perfectly all right .
inside the lid was written : the asps , a date , and to elaine below it .
staying in the hotel was mrs selwyn , the widow or perhaps the daughter-in-law of bishop selwyn , and her two daughters , dorothy and mary .
because he feared that this was indeed so , grumblingly m .
i examined him at half past three .
about time , too , growled the first man .
they are not like governments who do things always in a cheap way .
why have they got that terrible power of twisting things until you dont know where you are ?
i must say she didnt seem much upset by her husbands death .
miss bunner , descending the staircase , hastily put him right .
i didnt .
she had only just got off that heaving creaking boat (it had been an exceptionally rough three days through the bay and up to plymouth) and the last thing she wanted was to get into a heaving swaying train .
youve got a mania about that , i said roughly .
baker nodded her head .
there was not much light in the room ; the london skies were dark .
hercule poirot said : you are a man of the worlda man , i think , of considerable acumen .
yes , lick your lips over that .
a couple of minutes start and i shall be all right .
oh , i know its my own fault .
the other was silent for a few moments .
what i mean iswere , well , were interested parties .
the pavilion was at the side of the pool farthest from the house , and through its open door they commanded a view of the pool and the body and the path to the house along which the police would come .
and the danger of losing it comes , not from outsidenot from the might of germanys bombers , not from her seizure of neutral countries and fresh vantage points from which to attackbut from within .
i want my fun now .
he ran his finger slowly round and round the rim .
i was in the study , just steeling myself to open the safe when sir claud came in and found me .
and he thought , with a shock : of courseshe doesnt know hes dead .
she was short and spare , and i remember her eager jutting chin .
but i do not want him to get into trouble .
i take it that the footman , bauer , must almost certainly have been responsible for gerrys death .
poirot did not speak for a moment .
postern of fate , disasters cavern , said tommy .
madame alfrege was just about to enter into arch conversation with him when the door opened and an opulent-looking woman with a pekinese came in , and madame alfreges business instincts took her forward to the newcomer .
but , micky its no use my telling you it wasnt me , is it ?
it seems a pity that sanders had such a wonderful alibi ; but if it satisfied you it must have been all right .
justice has to be done and i have to be the executioner .
admirable , declared the little man , rubbing his hands .
they took this and at a certain turn in it peter lord clutched poirots arm , pointing to a window .
cant you play with some of them ?
leech there , and she was telling us the most wonderful things about you .
but the knowledge that his son was a thief broke the old mans heart .
he spoke a most peculiar english , making occasional remarks in french and german .
i dont think that really matters now .
i would have perhaps one evening dress , and that would be a black one so as not to show the dirt , and when we went out on muddy evenings , i would always of course , have , black shoes for the same reason .
to leave her home and her husband was a very serious step .
i could have gone on being married to ellie .
miss willett and i will cut in .
on the way there he encountered his host talking to miss montressor who had just emerged from the kitchen garden by the farther door .
he was by way of being an artist , you know .
he had a lot of shrewd scottish common sense , you know .
dear old florence , i murmured sentimentally .
belle goedler , he realized , had enjoyedstill enjoyedbeing a woman .
she was a childs nurse ; she cleaned her own nursery and did the little dears washing , but that was all .
he would tie up her money pretty tight .
there is a good deal more that i want to discuss , and i cannot do it here where one must preserve the decencies .
there was some rather sad story about her , she had an accident or something .
' and anyway i don ' t se why one shouldn ' t be interested in one ' s fellow-creatures ?
i suppose youve discovered that egg is suffering badly from hero-worship ?
a woman would know all right about her own husband .
he sang softly , yo ho ho , and a bottle of rum .
well , its not my real engagement ring .
pretty narrow .
with the wax flowers thrown in .
yes , that was a nasty jar .
he brought the last word out very quietly .
she is a pole .
glasses and so on .
theres a lot in this , said tuppence .
a beauty of vivid colouring , of abundant and triumphant vitality .
he accepted defeat with a good grace and rose to say good-bye .
such a to-do about his daughter carrying on with young bailey .
ive got to persuade him .
followed her , i have , spied upon her .
exactly what i said to arthur this morning , cried the doctors wife .
wanted to adopt me once .
well , of course , thats why it was cheap .
so youre charles beddingfelds daughter ?
she is a first-class medium .
yes , paul , my sisters husband , is a doctor .
a narrow plank bridge crossed the river and poirot and her husband induced mrs .
twenty-eight and after that was a mighty good toast , jane , said mr .
i bet he was he looked at me curiously .
oh , no , sir , just the opposite .
he did none of those things .
i was going to ring for the butler , but you will do instead .
but i must have all the facts .
and i didnt notice anyone hanging about the house either .
you are too clever for me , m .
he added , i wonder about that irish nurse .
people are getting up , leaving their tables , coming back .
the duke was facing it .
determined ?
' japp grew rather red in the face .
it is you ?
whats in your mind , satterthwaite ?
rather a frightened-looking young lady .
my own glasses fell out of my pocket as i stooped to get the gloves and pick up yours .
besides , i said , i thought it would put too much power in the hands of relatives .
there was a small cove below , but the access to it was perilous , only to be attempted by adventurous boys .
she used to show it to some of us children once .
then he signed his name .
his visit to them was in the interests of correctness .
i babble .
laurence browns voice could be heard , slightly raised , from inside .
oh , i just wandered around , said miss marple .
she had on a black dress and an unbecoming hat , and looked nervous and bewildered .
four circles , said caroline .
well before your time , said tuppence , looking appreciatively at his youthful countenance .
x/e .
somebody removing his luggage .
edward laughed .
dont suppose you found anything ?
after that date her memory is as good as yours or mine .
who told her how valuable the ring was ?
did anyone ever find out whether she had matches in her cottage all the time ?
i dont know why the children wouldnt wait up and see the new year in ?
now was that one of the cleggs she knew ?
i meant to tell you but i forgot .
he paused and said : there was only one person who was out in the garden when the shot was fired .
well , of course ii liked her .
she seemed pleasurably excited by the arrival of her visitors .
poirot said gravely : if i have , i am not sure that i can prove it .
miss gorringe on this occasion had no welcoming smile .
perhaps hes known her some time .
we shall do nicely now .
however , lets come into the drawing room .
what has been arranged , anna ?
the depressed peer sighed heavily .
division .
she was lookinglooking for me and at me .
no , said graham reluctantly .
he was certain that savage wasnt worried about his death and he didnt believe he had any special fear of cancer .
queried the lawyer .
madame will ring up the police at onceat oncebefore they arrive and cut our throats .
shed had a bad shock , you know .
towards me , monsieur .
safer .
so your time is fully occupied .
ce cher , cher ami !
the chief constable gave him a glance of inquiry and then rose to his feet .
as it is , said jefferson , your experience qualifies you to take an interest in the case , and any cooperation you offer will be welcomed .
shes made trouble , already , between you and me .
blake sat down again .
i was sure theyd fetch up at the house in soho sooner or later .
inside , to all appearances , lay the identical diamond ring .
a more sour-faced woman never lived .
yesbut there are always two ways of looking at things .
he drew it from his pocket as he spoke .
oh well , she said , it cant be helped .
goosey goosey gander was the one in question .
he had been referred to by the newspapers as a jugo slav , a czech , an albanian , a magyar , and a bulgarian , with a beautiful impartiality .
and you have heard of this li chang yen ?
you read things like that in books .
miss bennett turned in the doorway .
where have you sprung from so suddenly ?
you really must not be morbid , darling .
i can think of a lot worse things to say than that .
rafiel , studying her attentively .
excellent chaddy .
and i suppose you fell for it , hook , line and sinker .
then with a friendly little nod of the head he had moved away .
she opened her eyes with a start to find maude standing over her , holding a glass .
wheres that goddamed araq ?
she comes from the village of little dunning .
we must speak to mademoiselle bowers .
excite yourself not !
do you like the wallpaper ?
he believes im besotted about himyes , i think hes sure of thatbut all the same he isnt going to take any chances .
in front of him was a poached egg .
it is absolutely essential that we should without delay map out a plan of campaign .
' i ' ll show you .
jane was loyalbut she was also untidy ; she filled her drawers too full .
the man withdrew and returned with the water .
the doctor nodded his head thoughtfully .
the rest was easy .
her face had the same grim look upon it that he had noticed earlier in the day .
a little elderly man with large moustaches and an egg-shaped head was politely moving himself and his belongings from the seat corresponding to janes on the opposite side of the gangway .
i took him some letters to sign .
poirot , what about it ?
they went off together along the beach .
indeed , i was on the point of reluctantly dismissing sir eustace and mr .
youll catch it if you hurry .
he had heard voices from the kitchen at the end of the passage but no one had seen him .
not emotional ways !
when he had rung off , he sat down at his writing table and arranged the objects on it in a mechanical manner .
mr johnston .
that is the only course i can suggest , and i must confess i do not hope for much result .
travelling with sir eustace pedler and his party , i was fairly safe .
she asked me to get them .
this trout is delicious , he added , with appreciation .
he looked thoughtfully from her to silent , frowning rosalie , who was walking ahead by herself .
but if it happened to be a yellow one it was a pink one , said mrs bantry .
or perhaps a cameo brooch which had belonged to some great-aunt of his .
if it is true whose voice was it ?
supposing he had fallen backwards on this projecting lions head , and slipped from there to the ground .
the search commenced , but met with no success until it occurred to mrs mallaby that he might possibly be found in the room where they had supped an hour earlier .
' ' and he did not mention the matter the next morning ?
' the shock of having his trick seen through , ' he said .
you killed her , mr .
oh , but why ?
explanation for what , mr raynor ?
it was a public room .
yes , and you made such a fuss about it !
a murdered woman in the barn at rutherford halland you never told me anything about it .
i mean , your geoffrey doesnt drink or back horses ?
kennedy vaguely .
oh , she is very very nice .
i get headaches , though , she said .
with a groan , alfred inglethorp sank down again and buried his face in his hands .
pippa grew up a very beautiful girl and mildred grew up a plain one .
she is one of our foreign girls .
all the principal ones are there stillof course there have been changes among the under servants .
sheshe was a bit tight last night , and all worked up , and thats why she went for me .
he rattled the handle as he spoke .
i heard you were coming down .
then that is cleared up !
she went in by the front door , which was not allowed , and thereby avoided meeting any of the other girls .
sprot was waiting to scold the truant .
he walked into the room .
challenger was with him .
nurse hopkins was just coming up the stairs .
he likes out-of-the-way parts of the world .
like most englishmen , he felt something strongly , and proceeded to muddle around until he had , somehow or other , cleared up the mess .
yes , sir , or alternatively , the bell .
i wondered then .
winnie had benefited enormously from her fortnight at the seaside , but it struck him that her clothes were very shabby .
lynette brown ?
what a fuss old buffers make , thought ronnie to himself .
her arm was in his , her face lifteda typical face of the new civilization , intelligent , curious , untouched by the past .
then why ?
we shall have to check up on that , of course .
the young man went on : she said as how her lady would be coming down again in a fortnight and we fixed up to meet again then .
i retired a year ago .
he was righta window that needed adjusting , dropped umbrellaand the way the old lady was telling him what a good train this was .
fortescue .
she glanced at her wristwatch .
it was formed for the destruction of the eastern peoples , the slaves , the appointed slaves of the world .
shaking his head sadly , sir rowland watched him go , and then turned to clarissa .
he hailed a taxi and gave an address .
linda groped haltingly in the recess of her mind .
he spoke like one .
pretty heartless piece of goods .
nearly wrecked the car , you know it did .
youre so darned plucky .
certainly , laddie , look for yourself .
she looked round the room , shouted what ?
miss little was more or less in charge of things .
they set out together , the priest walking with a free striding step .
you may be right , said adam .
sybil laid the dress over a chair carefully , then she went out and up the stairs to the workroom .
she chuckleda rich victorian fruity chuckle .
but she spoke absently .
asked molly , unable to help smiling .
i never heard he was a big pot in any way ?
nothing is more boring than people talking to you about places and people whom youve never seen and know nothing about .
this was an allusion to a complaint from poirot as to the varying sizes of eggs which had offended his sense of symmetry .
i want all the facts , madame .
dinsmead gave a little whimpering cry and pulled her shawl up round her .
she never seems to have had any personal malice for any of the people whose deaths she seems to have caused .
you never know when a prying servant wont tamper with a desk or a locked drawerbut those junk cupboards full of last years tennis balls and old wallpaper are never opened except to shove something more in .
' ' and the young m .
it always pays .
he is in your rooms .
the hot-houses were in ruins .
i havent learnt anything .
well , you see , this young manleslie faulkener , his name washad written a play .
if anyone knew what she had found , she would be killed .
nonsense , said dr .
you see that it does matterand what it involves .
in his left hand he held a collecting box .
here is the list .
somebody else was to pick it up there in due course .
the first murderer stabbed his victim and left the compartment , turning off the light .
the point is , what do i do next ?
so are the french .
it would seem possible that we havefound her .
hes a man !
incredible scenes of starvation and misery were painted by her for the benefit of her audience .
well , it did happen , said victoria touchily .
not only did he hold the queen in the hollow of his hand , but he had a powerful weapon to negotiate with at any time .
if this had been an old house , with creaking wood , and dark shadows , and heavily panelled walls , there might have been an eerie feeling .
halfway back to bulawayo we stopped for tea at a somewhat primitive structure at the side of the road .
sir ambrose , said sir henry , you think he was the person aimed at ?
xi edward ferrier grasped poirot warmly by the hand .
sutcliffes writing pad towards him and sat frowning he must leave a note for joan but what could he say ?
in the afternoon there was mrs .
these are awfully good , she said .
if you had given orders , mlady , a bunch should have been cut and sent in to you , said macdonald severely .
in a years time there will be an announcement : a marriage is arranged and will shortly take place between lord horbury and the hon .
_num_ : _num_ mrs .
you can pick em up for nothing .
the police , sir ?
i shall miss you .
as a spot to dispose of a car it was ideal .
i was surprisedand , as i say , interested .
i said id keep an eye to the boys .
rafiel , she thought , was not that kind of a man .
i was very fond of her and she was devoted to daddy .
a few minutes later signor ascanio was ushered ina small , thin man with a secretive and furtive glance in his eyes .
then the judges small clear voice took up the thread once more .
later that night ellis left by the secret passage , resumed his own personality , and two days later was strolling about the gardens at monte carlo ready to be shocked and surprised by the news of his friends death .
if only , he thought , ce cher hastings were available .
again the broad joyful smile .
you packed the things in here ?
greenholtz of greenholtz , simmons and lederbetter , of graysholme street , wc _num_ , victoria had been whiling away a dull morning by entertaining the three other typists and the office boy with a vivid performance of mrs .
you know , one to send back to be serviced , as you might say , and the other one that they wore while it was away .
his voice was pleasant and he smiled , but tuppence wondered for a brief moment whether he was really what she would have called all there .
yes , ive always been able to hide things .
a jingly bracelet or two , several rings .
stilli suppose now it wont be necessary ?
ill get up and drive you down .
it was his intention to learn as much as he could from innocent local gossip before interviewing miss anne meredith .
eileen brandon looked startled .
im terribly hungry , said alice sopworth .
perhaps she was a criminal of some kind .
out to the fields with yahmose .
we work in with one another and remember this : we keep faith .
it was two days later that nurse copling came to george with a grave face .
shes frightfully sensitive .
they smiled at each other .
rafiel after they got back to england .
when they were outside the gate bridget said : do you want to pursue further researches or shall we go home by way of the river ?
i didnt mean to , but i have killed him .
its very hard to arrive at the truth .
was there a husband ?
and dont you forget ive got you covered every inch of the way .
this time , the objective was attained rather sooner .
she is eager to convert you .
it was there that i found my motive .
but i , i am not of the police .
blair hopefully .
people said : ever been to leathercombe bay ?
bobby had stepped full into the moonlight before he could stop himself .
as such you will doubtless find it easier to enter the kingdom of heaven , or so i have always heard .
she was strangled and then hung up on the door afterwards to make it look like suicide .
her glance at mary had set me thinking .
i know , said the slav lady .
she may have been carrying it in her hand meaning to post it .
i found this on the floor of my room .
i made various notes each time about things .
it is still in a glass on the oak dresser in the hallthe bottle of tonic itself is in the drawing room .
so you see it was someone who wanted it to seem as though my father had done it , and we think we know whoat least its one of two people gwenda , said giles .
i never heard such nonsense !
he led her forward .
and what did you say to her ?
he encouraged me to go .
the car is here waiting .
said this individual .
parker pyne arrived , a final convulsion seized the poor lady .
domestic life of major horton _num_ .
another guest for the guesthouse .
very few of us can do anything for anyone else , i said .
did that woman hang about all night and go up on the _num_ : _num_ in the morning ?
suddenly her nose was assailed by a sweet rather sickly smell that she associated vaguely with hospitals .
two sharp cracks rang outnot in the park this time , but definitely behind the locked door .
the folded paper was still in my hand .
but there is such a thing , i persisted .
the place of origin was paris and the message ran as follows : fortescue yewtree lodge baydon heath surrey .
i find it curious .
my ideas are childish in the extreme .
look here , ted , shes going out to dinner tonight .
poirot , you haven ' t let him escape ?
you will catch the chill .
someone has been hurt ?
come along , akibombo , said sally .
they cant expect to get the best people if they go on like this .
you young people who are used to all the gadgets , often find these primitive conditions rather upsetting .
i turned and took the path to the clearing .
he was a man of great wealth .
but i like him .
do you think parker is speaking the truth ?
in fact , we can talk .
is isaac anywhere about ?
now id like to forget it .
this friend , this writersurely he would not wish to blight the life of a perfectly innocent woman ?
her marriage relieved my uncles mind , as he knew that on her return to england the estate would have to be formally settled and handed over .
san francisco chronicle : a finely shaped book , richly devious and quite brilliant .
those statements related to your positions at the time when the murder of mrs .
do come in , please , and look .
he still couldnt understand the necklace .
should i be wasting my time ?
he knows people better than they know themselves .
i understand , said poirot , that mr gascoigne refused absolutely ?
inclined to be a mean man , mr chetwynd .
there are people .
she cried : dead ?
i could see now that she was in an extremity of terror , her eyes staring from her head .
i dont remember her last name .
eh bieni , too , range myself on the side of the minority .
that young man , dakin , must have got guts .
but there it is , i am too old .
but i shall have to know .
the two men were pacing the terrace together .
playing an instrument of pipes .
it was lord yardly .
ill go and telephone to the hotel to cancel my booking .
think too much of themselves nowadays .
that dream , mademoiselle , was vita/ !
some papers were arranged neatly stacked in heaps .
miss marple finished her breakfast , and got up in a pleasant leisurely fashion .
its the best thing to do , said clarissa .
he stood up , then sat down again .
leidner had a nice kind way of being interested in people and the things they told her .
his wife looked at him interestedly .
he wouldnt look at her , it seems , turned his face away and mumbled something .
hes an attractive young man , you know .
flashy , you know .
she must be cracked .
i wouldnt be in richard scotts shoes this weekend .
he was charming , full of information , and spoke french fluently .
in leisure moments , bits of my detective story rattled about in my head .
it is not a very difficult art to learn .
poirot took advantage of my silence to sweep on with his discourse .
potters and dillydallies aboutno staminano grip on life .
once hed finished the picture hed never see her again .
does he know yet , i wonder ?
asked sir charles curiously .
the important question i have to ask you , miss waterhouse , is if you saw the arrival of this manthe mystery man as im afraid the morning papers have called him .
in this case it would presumably have been criticism .
general ravenscroft had had a most distinguished career .
just so , june it was .
miss grosvenor sailed back with the tray held out in front of her like a ritual offering .
i was nervous last night , and over-wrought .
she for some reason was much addicted to throwing things out of the window .
it is because mrs .
he had a scratch upon his thumb which became poisoned , and septicaemia set in .
i remember miss lavinia shotacomb .
albert emerged from the side door .
shesoh , damn it , i want that girl .
and finally , having got his false poison pen well established , he staged the real thing .
they lack the breadth of a woman ' s imagination .
he took out the stopper and held the bottle to his nose before poirot ' s warning cry could stop him .
she will certainly have got over it by then .
i was afraid you would not let me do it , philip , said miss farquhar meekly .
there are the death duties , of course , but half my fathers money goes with the place , and lawrence will stay with us for the present , so there is his share as well .
i ask you what you know of him .
thats the one , said tommy .
the defence has sought to prove that there were other alternatives .
silly business .
of course not , said cathies mother .
sprot glanced at her watch .
protheroe never wrote it .
i asked her about some friends of hers she was always mentioning in her letters , the gallaghers .
youre dining at the american embassy , arent you , next week ?
more so than when i left en gland fifteen years ago .
very well , thenso far , so good .
iv there are things one does not want to go over in ones mind again .
satterthwaite reached his room .
well he glanced across at the other man .
and what do you think i took ?
she got up , put on her dressing gown and slippers , and a woollen scarf round her head and went out to reconnoitre .
he spoke as though he had actually disliked her .
you have , too , the chivalrous spirit .
zeropoulos was in the rue st honor .
ive always told you so .
i rang em up .
its like this room of yours , in the middle of a labyrinth of corridors , just like a dream when you think you will never get out .
but there were so many things in my headsimmons , you know , and the bindweed in the michaelmas daisiesand hoping mrs .
you think that the great ahasuerus of the first lesson was artaxerxes the second .
i just assumed it was a manbut it was really just aa figurea shadow .
the whole things a rum business .
so warm and comfortable and spacious , with its faint savory smell of cooking .
i think you will find , my lady , that everything has been attended to quite satisfactorily .
i began to think as joe was right in telling me i oughtnt to have had anything to do with jackie .
the side windows of the upper story of mrs .
theres an old blind man stands on the corner .
tuppence was not tempted by miss lavinia shotacomb .
i thought they would be better burnt .
i want to tell her ive succeeded in the commission she gave me .
a mary .
there are some people who do remember .
she couldnt have seen me .
he shook his head , sat down in the doctors chair and pressed the desk button .
she unhooked it with a steady hand .
and so , being very quick-witted , she deliberately pointed to the wrong picture .
good morning , sir .
she took what she thought was cough mixture and it was hat paint , explained bridget .
dane calthrop got up and forbade the banns and said it had got to be stopped !
she accepted the knowledge without surprise , as though it were something of which she had long been aware , but which had only just risen to the surface of her mind .
that may be the reason he moved out of the cottage and into long meadows .
not with these two bullet holes in the wall ?
you werent in the room ?
miss fisher bit her lip to stop herself laughing .
three times for the valet .
at the psychological moment he drops it .
i keep a very sharp eye on the undesirable type of young man , but what can one do , colonel race ?
he started , opened his mouth , shut it again .
i should say the mans got you on his mind .
very badly kept .
you were typing , he said , to the right of the back window .
the evidence of rhoda dawes _num_ .
the great thing was never to answer him back .
luke displayed a faint interest in the birds and then asked the price of the dish .
such a nice surprise for you .
she pressed on me every possible remedy for increasing my family .
not a bit of it .
all inquiries drew a blank .
he had told her of his engagement ?
a casual paper , slipped in among others , signed without readingbut linnet doyle was not like that .
i pretended to tighten it .
he may have been conscious of steps behind him but he thought nothing of them .
well , i said impatiently , what do you think of it all , mrs .
sir stafford nye looked at him .
' ' do you know , ' said hercule poirot , ' i fred that ex-traordinarily interesting .
did you know your sister-in-law at all ?
miss lawson popped out of her room at the head of the staircase .
im not one to imagine things , mr .
lets hope the high-mettled hispano has not been subjected to any indignities .
tommy was left to his meditations .
ah , there you are , reggie .
it is , then , an affair of great moment ?
richards voice was empty and despairing .
yesdoubly careful .
the girl walked along beside him for some minutes in silence .
if you think theres too much to do with the boys here , i can help you and its not that at all , said lucy .
he has of late been making certain inquiries for me , which may throw light on this matter .
you must remember the case , pedler .
for me , yes .
thora grey nodded .
even at this moment she was a strong woman .
she nodded towards the farther side of the pool , where two paths ran into the woods .
my table , necessarily , was some distance awayi didnt want to be spotted too obviously .
and of course we had all sorts of dodges and things .
you were saying that mr .
it was abrupt , authoritative .
do you know what this is ?
when he pretended to go for a doctor , he really only slammed the door and then crept quietly upstairs and hid behind the door of this room , where miss wade would presently send you up on some excuse .
lola brewster is my best bet , he said .
it might be in a teapot somewhere .
our mrs .
poirot got up , crossed to the other side of the hearth , rearranged the second square chair so that it was at a definite geometric angle , and sat down in it .
precisely thatcareless .
now i was walking along wilbraham crescent just as i had walked on september _num_ th .
it is the root , too , of his parsimony , i think .
opalsens belongings .
she switched on the lamp by her bed and looked at the clock that stood by the lamp on the table .
this is a hotel of good class .
naturally i was upset when my daughter had a narrow escape of her life .
dont say that isaac knew much neither .
madame desires ?
we felt quite sure of it .
luke left dr .
oh lord , said mr .
no , i suppose not .
it seemed that the political canvasser would not be required .
craddock got up .
the sisters are very alike , but by no means incapable of distinguishment .
i used to think about it night after nightand then we got poorer and poorer .
he turned abruptly into a chemists shop .
im afraid i cant help you .
fourteen i in a quiet hotel room edwards was listening deferentially to sir henry clithering .
poor sobekhow i have misjudged him .
it was beginning to rain , and they turned up the collars of their coats as they trudged through the slush of the road .
i would have made him happy .
yes , i suppose you will .
odd i havent seen you here before .
she came in to find her mistress lying back with closed eyes .
then when wed finished with the town , he took me up to a kind of eating house or tearoom , right up on the hillside looking down over the old citya marvellous view .
slowly a kind of fascination came over her , the fascination of assorted merchandise coming from all over the world to meet the strange and varied wants of a mixed population .
well go along to her after slack has finished with your maid .
finally , with a slight smile , he folded and refolded it until he had a small oblong .
phillipa haymes looked faintly puzzled .
nineteen cars and the church quite full and the canon read the service beautiful , i thought .
after all , i said to him , you do trim your beard and cut your hair .
shes put deadly enemies next to each other at the dinner table , and run riot over the colour question !
thats funny .
they were like friends .
shown a snapshot of wu ling , they recognized him at once .
by the pricking of my thumbs postern of fate credits cover illustration and design by sara wood back ad copyright this book is a work of fiction .
at the laurels , emily was informed that mrs .
or else something of great importance had to come first (usually to do with cabbages or brussels sprouts of which he liked to grow inordinate quantities) .
she is suspected , you see , of stealing !
royde is here from malaya .
it might be that .
he picked up the two or three letters that he had opened late last night when he arrived .
he was irishand he was going overseas he never wrote or anythingi suppose i was a fool .
here he got some definite information .
you might give me credit for a little dissimulation at need .
he hadnt sent any message by me , sir .
none of my plans miscarried .
then he sniffed vaguely , and frowned .
you have always trusted my word , baron , said anthony .
he came running back to say she was ill .
have you seen ella ?
sir harry and i oh , let me intoduce you admiral sir harry weardale , our first sea lord m .
thus , on friday mornings , after a hurried glance at the headlines in the daily paper (international situation critical !
ratchett , his story was neither more nor less than absurd .
it is a name i have never heard until now .
carmichael strolled along very quietly , his eyes taking in the scene with just the right touch of childlike pleasure in his surroundings .
did you see that car of his ?
but we must celebrate .
mcgrath , that you have just arrived in this country from south africa .
he took a packet from his pocket .
presently richard baker and mrs .
there was a poison bottle , empty , and a cork .
she looked with interest into the dark blue handbagpowder ; no lipstick ; two pounds fourteen and sixpence in english money ; a handkerchief and an identity card in the name of freda elton , _num_ manchester road , sheffield .
not only does she see and hear practically everything that goes on , but she draws amazingly neat and apposite deductions from the facts that come under her notice .
many elements from christies happy childhood in her family home , ashfield , appear in barely disguised formthe books she read , her rocking horse , the monkey-puzzle tree in the garden , the greenhousebut the arch-plotter of yesteryear is little in evidence .
i assumedi dont know whya nebulous they in the background .
then he departed with miss courtenay , left her at the door of her flat (instead of going in and trying to pacify her as he affirmed) and returned post-haste to the colossus but as harlequin , not pierrot a simple transformation effected by removing his outer costume .
i give in , said haydock .
if you want to discuss murder , said raymond , you must talk to my aunt jane .
the only sad thing is that if you inherit a good collection of china and furniture it leaves you no excuse for starting a collection of your own .
all the corridors and the rooms so resemble each other that it is difficult to know where one is or what the plan of the building can be .
i dont see whats so odd about that ?
war time !
they looked straight across to the snow peaks .
i told you that i was at styles for a purpose .
but his health ?
but strangely enough it was not for abbots mede he was bound , but for a small inn some fifteen miles distant which bore the rather unusual name of the bells and motley .
to hate is a waste of time .
then there comes down an inspector from scotland yard , inspector miller you said , did you not ?
his duties he fulfils punctiliously .
it was grave , and had a certain dignity .
said victoria rather sadly .
did not monsieur lawrence make the sour face every time mademoiselle cynthia spoke and laughed with his brother ?
the girl looked at him with lacklustre eyes .
my word , thats some getup .
turned away for a moment , remarked japp , and the other fellow snatched up a revolver and shot him .
what shall we do with her ?
then well see if it was the gun that shot christow .
dont go on drivelling there .
and the other one ?
pynei mean , hes such a mild lamb one wouldnt dream of anything of that kind .
didnt you hear a shot ?
he told me all about it and i felt awfully sorry for him .
and suddenly he couldnt keep it in any longer and vented his rage against his sonssaying they were a lot of namby-pamby old womensomething like that .
eight a parlourmaid opened the door of the opposite wing to us .
claudia reece-hollandher fathers the mp , is he ?
in the main , they were the same as before , but miss chevenix-gore was only to inherit on condition that she married mr .
but how are we to get them to him ?
i put her up to it .
almost as though he came up out of the sea .
he said : you dont mean grant nodded .
obituary notice _num_ .
carrie louise moved swiftly .
a tout lheure then .
developed first as a fishing village and then further developed as an english rivieraand now a mere summer resort , crowded in august .
i am not joking .
its proportions were the same as the drawing room on the ground floor below .
jane bit her lip .
that she wasnt going to stay unless they got another maid quickand they wouldnt be likely to do that when there had been a murder in the house !
what do you say , sir ?
of course you havent had my experience of life .
youre absolutely right , said gwenda .
she could not yet trust herself to speak but she smiled at him .
and sometimes that is helpful .
he sounded heated .
you go to the fishmonger and i to the police station .
bounced off again into a long angular man whose attach case caught him in the small of the back .
that was what hugo wanted .
julian felt rather like a dog who has been congratulated on performing a clever trick .
he had polio some years ago .
if you can manage to moderate your transports and look where youre going , it might be as well , i suggested .
then he said fiercely , youve got to marry me , youve got to marry me .
how did you come to be on the spot in such a marvellous manner ?
is it the one of mr .
inglethorp took her coffee upstairs with her , i do not see what you expect to find , unless you consider it likely that we shall discover a packet of strychnine on the coffee tray !
i believe that if i could have seen her then , she would have told me his name and bid me go for him for all i was worth .
however , in the end they all showed a good profit when i sold them .
three john christow sat in his consulting room , seeing his last patient but one for that morning .
oliver , making rather a point of this last word , when anybody has heard that any of their friends whom they dont happen to know very well have sudden illness or consult doctors , they always think its cancer .
the car slowed down to take the turn into the gates of kingsdean .
you can just squeeze through it .
freda clegg .
you wait till the coppers come round and arsk me all about what i saw last night .
you may have noticed it , mr .
oliver , suddenly restored to calm .
where was it hidden ?
but princess dragomiroff declined to take this course .
the car , with mrs .
maisie would tell him where she was to be found .
she was a good-looking girl .
its a bit obvious really maybe we are meant to take the bait .
evelyn howard bowed her head .
you lie very well , gipsy girl .
sir george came out of the cabin , looking dazed .
miss amory did as she was asked .
it still matters in the country , dear , said adela placidly .
i want to tell you one thing , dad ; you are wrong about armandthe comte de la roche , i mean .
i went to my tent , changed my shoes and got out my own packet of china tea .
she had travelled back on the same boat from india as mr .
i must do what i can .
not necessarily , said poirot .
come on , cornelia , say yes .
what made you come to sutton chancellor in the first place , mrs .
treves had given lady tressilian a shock which had told adversely on her health .
one of these days he would have had to be locked up .
does it really matter , inspector ?
it was arranged that joanna should pick me up with the car and drive me back up the hill in time for lunch .
the door !
in novels , i have noticed , anonymous letters of a foul and disgusting character are never shown , if possible , to women .
are you very much distressed that a crime should have been committed on this train ?
i shall train for something .
he came through a small side door and up a steep staircase to this room through a loose panel there was to the left of the fireplace .
well , well have to risk that , said bundle .
father pretended to consult some notes .
she was eminently sensible .
the inspector regarded her silently for a moment , and then asked , is he ever violent ?
why gulbrandsen ?
rather , said tuppence , and well get to the bottom of it too .
well , id say , you know , that shes done all she can do here .
the acknowledgement that the chinaman who had called that afternoon had endeavoured to lure me away discounted any good i might have done by leaving my sign of four books .
we left at five oclock next morning .
one grows up .
gardener , that really is very ill-bred .
that codicil even though genuine could have been upset .
the next morning was , i remember , a beautiful day .
philip blake grinned .
who was speaking ?
go to the devil !
isnt that rather a pity ?
he spoke very little and was obviously bearing his fourth sons presence as a christian should .
you werent pretending .
daresay im wrong and old-fashioned .
you go protesting that of course its nonsense , but that it will interest you .
and fastened my window and bolted my door .
poirot said thoughtfully : a long time .
it couldnt be miss milray , said sir charles with assurance .
were they the price of a slavish devotion to fashion ?
go on , giles , said molly .
somebody is going to tell somethingand then theyre killed first .
and theyre bad inside ?
he can understand what one says to him ?
but there , nowadays even if youve got a chilblain you run to the doctor with it so as to get your moneys worth out of the national health .
i nearly didi could have told simon that i wouldnt go on with itbut then perhaps she broke off .
monsieur desires monsieur hautet ?
any hint of me being mixed up in a police case and this new contract that ive been discussing will go to the winds .
all the neighbours talking and the worry of it all , though i must say the police were very kind , all things considered .
what sort of woman was she ?
now if captain marshall had had any sense hed have married miss darnley , whos a very very charming woman and a very distinguished one .
he raised the lower sash which came gratingly .
but thank god im not a schoolmistress !
and at that moment emily realized what it was she had subconsciously missed at the moment of her accident .
i supposeyes .
however , i never contradict a patient .
you permit that i speak to you for a little moment ?
but she only smiled and shook her curls .
calls herself one anyway .
i was at a partyoh !
she opened her mouth reproachfully , but the words remained unspoken .
he said , looking at her curiously : so you realize it may come to that ?
ive tried to give him confidence in his own ability .
stand by .
what that amounts to , i gather , nobody knows at present .
ah , thank you , said battle .
i was in his .
major palgrave stared .
but as they came out of the dining room the front door banged shut .
i dont believe anybody but you could find out the truth .
linspecteur .
hale looked at him curiously .
flashes come back to onethey are seen for a momentthen gone again .
oh , surely you can do better than that ?
he had challenged hercule poirot to unmask him .
poirot examined the childs neck , then drew away again .
she added : well find out from the concierge who they are .
what did she reply ?
old uncle roderick ?
oh , yeth , you are having a good time , i darethay !
and that is another reason why i would rather have nothing to do with any action undertaken by theresa and charles !
yes , she said it .
simply , shall we say , to assuage my curiosity .
we had now disposed of an excellent breakfast , and were sitting in a small panelled room which had been the late mr .
you know , lady frances , there are some queer customers going about .
really the kind that you have to be shutting up all the time .
and rising and pulling her gown round her , she bade me come with her .
what about it , louisa ?
then one of the nurses was a crook and listened at the door .
there , listen to that that was a creaking sound above their heads .
wheres this young lady ive been hearing such a lot about ?
yes , yes but all the same colgate looked at him questioningly .
what i thought is , said albert , it wouldnt do any harm to look , would it ?
and where did he go then ?
he had given up his own girl and hed tied up with the foreign girl instead .
i will leave you , he said .
hoskins inquired with interest : whos this monsieur poirot , sir ?
a confession that you murdered mrs .
it was faintly familiar .
and theres lady stubbs , hattie , about twenty years younger than he is , rather beautiful , but dumb as a fish in fact , i think shes definitely half-witted .
farleys dream was very important .
those lines from the duchess of malfi were really the clue to the whole thing .
they had sent the beard , as directed , to l .
we now come to the day itself .
what i want to know , she continued , is why this child was masquerading as a parlourmaid ?
because in the sports pavilion there was a tennis racquet containing a fortune in jewels .
it had become cold and we wanted to wander down from the towersbut what then ?
youll all be just mad with yourselves .
ive seen a lot of that sort of thing .
i had an idea she might be in the country .
and does it make all the difference ?
she created something terrible , said cherry .
the princess listened to him in silence , her small toad-like face quite impassive .
some deal in grain ?
she is the only person connected with the case who wears glasses .
that he should have dreamed that - night after night - and then - it ' s as though he were hounded to death !
shall i tell you what tina said when she regained consciousness ?
theyre very pleasant people .
when they had reached the stage of la torte , a somewhat sticky confection of chocolate , the german said : so you go to shiraz ?
so if you both saw mrs .
satterthwaite was silent for a minute as a vision rose up before himthe faded old woman with grey hair , and the radiant golden-haired creature sitting in the sunshine at cannes .
eleven .
she was wrapped in a grey chinchilla coat and there was something catlike and stealthy in the way she moved .
abroad a lot , he was , bought a lot of heathen statues and had them sent home .
so i think he has some nice points .
do you often come here ?
the car passed us on the road .
he had felt the blow keenly , i could see .
he might have cried out .
i am a theatrical costumer , said the dark man importantly .
queried the inspector .
i am not as insensitive to art in crime as you think .
mayherne sharply .
she was in some respects a taciturn girl , and sometimes did not answer .
its a very difficult world .
holds the purse strings .
why shouldnt he have three pairs of gloves lying about ?
poirot repeated with a frown : too late .
poirot turned a beaming face upon her .
shes rather nervous .
there were jobs to be done in the house : days when you cleaned silver photograph frames , days when you darned your stockings , days when you learnt a chapter of great events in history , a day when you had to go down the town and pay all the tradesmens bills .
and we are in a tight place .
according to foster , the gardener , some people called elworthy had it before the hengraves and before them mrs .
this one had an equally doubtful roof , and was smaller ; the beds were narrower and there was less air and light .
over his long robe of striped cotton he wore a discarded khaki tunic , old and stained and torn .
after a long discussion of poirots particular internal troubles , he purchased a small box of indigestion lozenges .
her voice was deep and rather attractive .
the greeks , i believe , had a word for it .
everything , said molly .
what was the actual cause of your disagreement , mademoiselle ?
when i saw it i wanted to live there as badly as i had ever wanted to live in any house .
race shook his head slowly .
the king of ruritania , and rudolf rassendyll was stand-in for the king and fell in love with princess flavia to whom the king was officially betrothed .
sarah thought that it would be a brave man who thought he could impose upon lady westholme !
thomas drily , but that doesnt make it a fact .
yes , because if it was daniels the prime minister would have heard the order , and would have asked the reason .
growled poirot .
also , i thought , i was going to have a literary agent .
kenneth marshall and i were more or less children together .
at the end of it she handed back the programme to him with a few words of thanks .
i hadnt time this morning .
she apologized , and the other woman made an exclamation .
then , the day being warm and sunny , he decided to make the best of his present situation and explore the amorys garden .
hubbard tentatively mentioned a sum which gave , she considered , ample margin , and celia agreed at once .
they both had well-brushed hair , suspiciously angelic faces , and perfect manners .
poppy ?
as she rushed from the room , mrs .
she is , as you say , fed up to be here , in fez , where there are no jewellers shopsand no other expensive women to admire and envy her toilettes .
but i must go round to this friend of mine .
je vous remercie .
but she was quite quick in the uptake .
though i doubt if his evidence will add anything to our sum of knowledge .
eva kane was the craigs nursery governess , remember .
anne had got paler .
' i don ' t believe it , ' she declared .
and then it happened .
his nose twitched .
i was all , as you say , on wires , the cat on the hot bricks .
here again was merchandise piled on shelves , coffeepots and sugar hammers of brass and copper , old persian silver , heaps of embroideries , folded abas , enamelled damascus trays and coffee sets .
they never think of anyone but themselves .
and yet that explanation does not quite satisfy methose pearlsah , sacr , my little idea ought to be right .
where are you going to have it , mrs .
stood for arabella tanios .
can i offer you a drink , inspector craddock ?
your husbands very well and , naturally , awaiting you with impatience .
that is quite right , monsieur .
i responded in kind and as we went on up the drive i was conscious of those blue eyes raking our backs inquisitively .
and what was her part ?
that does sound like a shot .
that , mon ami , you will hear in due course .
it was nice of you to come , m .
after all , he had told you he would have an alibi .
it rested with a far from satisfied expression on the little belgians long moustaches .
said the duke , with a tinge of acerbity in his manner .
must be effectclimate .
ive got to prove to you that dr .
she added : as a matter of fact , gervase is standing just behind your left shoulder now .
i know , she said sympathetically .
various distressing events then occurred .
and then comes the inquest .
i dont say so before the younger people , it might discourage them , but its trueyes , its a very wicked world .
ill ring up miss packard and ill get the address of the lawyers what lawyers ?
come , let us join the truants .
well , i was thinking more of illicitly imported drugs .
we never see a soul .
she said she was very tired and she went to lie down on her bed .
then she smiled and calmly walked over to the table by the armchair to pick up her cigarette .
japp lowered his voice .
there were three of us .
if you say so .
their noses twitched , she said , and then the smell came .
you ought to have been in diplomacy , remarked bundle .
it can be done , he said at last .
miss bowers ?
she drew back as though stung .
we suspect , but we do not know .
i didnt drop it .
where is my dressing gown ?
his features reminded her of someone .
its made plenty of talk in the ward .
what were a pair of pince-nez doing in carlotta adams handbag ?
can i come in , rowley ?
a woman who could be intelligent about everything else in the world could be a complete fool when it came to some particular man .
my lips are sealed , said adam .
it is now eight oclock .
it was a moment for immediate action .
on her shoulder was pinned a deep , salmon-pink rose .
it was not a war like the last one .
because the mere fact that a girl is absent for a few days without telling her parents , or the friends with whom she is living , where she is going , is not particularly unusual nowadays .
we have done extremely well .
did you hear your son jacks arrival ?
still , it is better to be on the safe side .
and so , you see , i put people off their guard .
there is something , some focus of evil there .
you , madame , could say nothing else .
then passing straight to the object of his visit , he invited the architect to make a statement as to his movements on the previous evening .
kameni was a fine young mantogether they would raise strong children .
but where was i ?
miss marple smiled alsoan indulgent smile .
under the circumstances , we were naturally not a cheerful party .
you will lunch with us , m .
nurse hopkins went across and shook the girl .
i wouldnt go as far as that , sir .
he never kept in touch with anyone .
five hundred for mrs .
the garage in the mews where harold kept his car was a private lockup that he rented and there was no one to notice who came and went or any reason to remember one evening in particular .
not that particular day .
if you ask me , the murderer of rogers would take jolly good care to be rolled up in bed snoring .
leidner made a gesture of thanks .
his own determined casualness and flippancyalmost gaietyupset me .
was one of those personalities a part being played ?
broadribb , i dont quite think that .
they were all very necessary , to reinforce the weaknesses on the debit sidein particular her own bodily weakness .
she was certainly no police matron .
are you sure , m .
what did you think ?
cook will have repeated it everywhere .
and youre smart .
yes , i thought he was drunk .
they were on top of the world now .
im so sensitive .
never thinks of anything else , said miss bellever grimly .
i dont know his name .
damn it all , charles , dont you see how cruel and unnecessary it would be ?
she was reclining very comfortably on a sofa and near her were books and some knitting and a glass of orange juice and a box of chocolates .
harry broke all that up !
she asked suddenly , who lived here before the hengraves ?
he paused and looked at edmundson .
himself .
lady stranleigh had been found dead in her bath and her death was due to drowning .
i have a very interesting work on political economy .
i can show you my references , the valet replied .
i believed that , for my sake , he would turn over a new leaf .
introductions completed , he gravitated naturally to the side of colonel raceand the two men were soon talking sport and comparing their experiences on safari .
oh , sonia .
but as i say , alison wilde never thought of anybody else but herself she was the sort of person who tells you what theyve done and what theyve seen and what theyve felt and what theyve heard .
thomas royde said rather huskily : dont be a fool !
all the phrases that we can use nowadays so happily to excuse guilt .
there was that silly bet , you know .
i thought it was just the sort of fussing way nurses have at the timebut i dunnoit may have been more than that .
thats what it looks like , sir .
but in that case began melrose in that case mr .
tuckerton , its not quite his usual style , and that makes it interesting toer she saved me the trouble of continuing .
im twenty-two and she broke off as the door opened and giles came in .
yahmose is an old woman .
you may say that its imagination , that ive built up an ideal , but it isnt so .
im fond of alexander .
thats why i hoped .
what made you select that exact time , major ?
am i sure , myself , about anything at all ?
you think she sent david here to get it ?
if i had not gone to ashfield and left him in london he would probably never have become interested in this girl .
dear monsieur poirot !
professor liskeard wants to speak to you .
giraud evidently did not desire my company and , from what i had seen , it seemed fairly certain that jack renauld did not either .
and it is a good thing that that is so .
but he passed on to fresh questions .
you have a wide experience of life , mr .
yes , but this timeyou dont understandim responsible .
slowly , unbelievingly , carrie louise took a step towards the door .
theyre not bad boys , mind you , but they need discipline .
george lomax accepted the information and laid his plans accordingly .
it makes me think of it too much .
in a minute or two it flitted back again and then the subdued chinking sounded again .
i was looking at the last person on earth i would have expected to see .
but her eyesthere was a kind of anguished grief in them that was the most moving thing i have ever known .
i took up the telegram and was about to pass out again when an idea struck me .
there was a bottle of one of them in his roomserenite .
the lack of motive makes it very intriguing .
they stood for a minute or two by the rail .
then why has he gone awaylike this ?
ah , yes , littlegreen house wont be long in the market .
it was a matter of gamblers luck .
a tall figure rose to her feet as mrs .
the whole things a nightmare !
alan , she said , alan carstairs .
there was a french family at fez that mrs .
neither on the body , nor in the luggage at the hotel , was there any trace of the papers relating to the mine .
if you would permit that i straightened your tie .
not quite as good as that , ivor .
id never seen her before .
you have come from a hot climate .
theyve managed to keep us apart .
sounds a damn sight more sensible , i agree .
twice in the course of the last week i have been summoned by telephone to an urgent casein each case to find that the summons has been a fake .
he looked at her strangely .
an early one that didnt count , and then a foreign prince or count , and then another film star , robert truscott , wasnt it ?
but then shaitana seemed to take rather a fancy to anne .
hilary leaned forward , staring at him .
the butler was already holding the front door open .
not necessarily the very remote past .
if i can help you in any way , said mr .
youll certainly find it real country all round here .
ive got to go out again at once , as a matter of fact .
it was the trick of the lady sawn in half that made me think of it .
going in for a what-do-you-call-it , a diploma in history or archaeology or something .
norman fell in with the plan readily enough .
everyone is coming by the four thirty train .
there is , of course , the real virginia of the letters .
enough for both to live in the momentthe world was a good place , a place of carnal delightssun , sea , skya discreet garbage heap .
a scratch with it means death .
haydock overtook me in his car at the corner of the vicarage road .
every twopenny-halfpenny hop calls itself that nowadays , but this was the real thing , held at the colossus hall , and all london at itincluding your lord cronshaw and his party .
elspeth mckay came out to the door to meet him .
the superintendent coughed .
well , this illness of mr .
fifteen mark easterbrooks narrative i liked divisional detective-inspector lejeune at first sight .
come , i will help you .
at _num_ : _num_ dorcas overhears her mistress saying angrily that scandal will not deter her .
she spoke authoritatively .
she passed from the warm sunlight into the shadow of the house .
yes , threats .
you need not die .
she threw him a look , but obeyed .
hardcastle continued to smile appeasingly .
possibly two guardian angels , said miss marple .
fournier shrugged his shoulders .
for us and not for them , agreed tuppence , abroad .
perfectly ordinary door , isnt it ?
twenty-five not from captain hastings personal narrative mr .
i cannot look into your heart , mademoiselle ; i do not think you would let me if i could .
now , as she handed him his hat and stick , she was conscious of his eyes raking her through .
to my surprise it turned out to be race .
have you been raising money on your grandfathers will ?
are you coming to bed , jane ?
naturally you would change your name .
shes really a very charming woman .
to put it vulgarly , ive got something up my sleeve .
allen had been found and i was struck at once by several significant details .
would he suspect catherine at all ?
gardner , he is getting very excited .
how are you going to manage ?
the comic , almost ridiculous , aspect that he presented disturbed her conception of him .
it would do you good , dearie .
pictures , music , books , i said truthfully .
there was no immediate response .
i hope you are well .
which seemed to calgary nonsense !
but there are many members of it at liberty , and they will take the only revenge they canmy life .
dinsmead , he said .
theres the french fathers disappearance to be cleared up too .
they are so busy knocking that they do not notice that the door is open !
yes , americans , they not take tea .
and birdsa woman came to call one day for subscriptions for the vicarage fte .
i have been drawing without ceasing at top speed since eight oclock this morning .
i should say so .
their handwriting is like hieroglyphics of some kind .
grainger could not be imagined .
frances said : you didnt tell me thati thought she got it for keepsthat she could leave it to any one she liked ?
the explanation of your change of attitude , mademoiselle .
heather never took anything like that in her life , he said .
that was my idea .
the chance is slight , but it must not be neglected .
your mothers alive , isnt she ?
i thinki think , mon cher collgue , that we shall get results !
we run a small business but we dont do much in the wig line nowadays , she said , though my husband does advise and get wigs designed for men who are bald .
" he handed me a letter from some lawyers in melbourne , hurst and crotchet , and a card .
i will be quite sensible .
macgregor ?
and nothing of importance has arisen since .
he bowed .
other things happened that were meant to fit in with the pattern of celia austinbut they did not fit in .
no , he was sure he had not got any enemies .
you avoid the tiresome customs business at calais .
the witch-woman tapped at a door , poked her head in , said , this must be the gentleman you wanted to see .
but they look nice and partified .
hercule poirot , very neatly and foppishly attired , his moustaches waxed to a stiff point .
my mother was english , id been educated in england , and i was far more interested in england than in herzoslovakia .
no , no , monsieur van aldin ; not impossible .
ii hercule poirot did not sleep well that night .
betterton wants to go abroad .
though perhaps just a weeny bit tyrannical on occasions .
what extraordinary rules , said sir stafford .
i forget which it is .
i hear you are going to see this wonderful show which you will never forget , it is a thing to be seen only once in a lifetime .
they say it behind my back , you understand .
quite good credentials , the usual permits , etc .
whos that out there in the garden ?
they swerved round .
he was gracious , mein fhrer .
have they been married long ?
mr barraclough sent you ?
im going for help .
but who is k .
i am only making assumptions .
she sat down again with her embroidery as we left the room .
its so bad for philip being here .
not really such a little house either .
not that it is necessarily going to be exciting as a life , but it will be exciting to you because it is your life .
it seemed to be made , when the light caught it , of some metallic woven tissue .
the lack of worry about finances was pleasant after all we had under-gone in the pastand possibly it went to our heads a bit .
this he tapped the scrap in his fingerswas torn from it .
race said coldly : can we have an account of your movements last night , mr .
there must be a waythere must be .
well , havent you got everything ?
have you notified the police ?
you cannot get round it .
ow !
buses there crowded , frequent and several routes go within a mile or so of lytchett st .
clearly any scheme for cross-questioning the lady was out of the question for the moment .
there may be a poisoner at work among us .
miss marple looked across the intervening space between her bungalow and his .
eight minutes past six , exactly .
what are you talking about ?
he purloins the sugar hammer , laughingly referred to as a perfect weapon for murder by mrs .
good god , midge , id like to take you right out of it all down to ainswick .
he spoke with sudden anger .
at ten oclock tredwell was with my husband in the smoking room .
a great actor does not cease to act because he is not on the stage anymore .
dont tell me that wicked woman upstairs has destroyed it ?
was he to come out in the open , or not ?
looking around , said the major .
said anderson .
its a matter of an hours work or so .
perhaps , said joan doubtfully .
robert gardner was lying on a couch by the window in a big room on the first floor .
she might , perhaps , have had a shock of some kind ?
ive had too much of it .
nobody appreciates dr .
in fact , the slight lack of balance a person shows when they have brought off what can be described as a long shot .
came into walters office to make her will the other day .
naturally , im prejudiced .
you mean things that dont really matter , but that get in the way ?
you are not under oath in this court , mrs .
she looked at him impatiently .
ah , we have here something i do not understandan unknown factor .
quite right , said colonel bantry .
it must have been an accident .
he scowled .
six hercule poirot said : so you see , my friend , the lies people tell are just as useful as the truth ?
screening someone ?
restless chap .
probably not , said mrs .
today , if you like .
thats horrible , said bunch .
in the meantime , he went on , everyone in the household has told his or her tale , mr .
the buzzer on hardcastles table sounded .
jack argyle has a perfect alibi for the time the crime was committed .
so sad being left a widow so young only twenty-two i do hope she marries again soon .
personally i believe that the murderer came from outside andover , but we must neglect no avenue of research .
the vicar , a gentle , middle-aged man , was always the last to hear anything .
when he was at yewtree lodge he must have heard about these blackbirds .
general grant ?
a sensational discovery was made yesterday at the mill house , marlow .
several things .
i recognized it for the paper on which he had written that list of peoplea .
and now , my friend , said poirot as we stepped towards the station , you see it all !
ah , i think crossfield has it .
it sounded interesting , and the hours were much betterthe dispensary closed down at six oclock and i would be on duty alternate mornings and afternoonsso it would combine better with my home duties as well .
i dont want my medicine .
its presence in tuppences coat was due to the fact that she had used it for pinning in some flowers a day or two before .
i dont know , inspectori dont know at all !
thats the problem dr .
what life would be with hori , she did not know .
hercule poirot shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands .
moreover , if i had accepted the marcheses offerit would have been possible for sir reuben to conclude a private arrangement with him later , thus allowing the goblet to pass legally into his possession .
after all , a woman should know her own husband when she sees him ?
armstrongs .
it is not a new idea , poirot reminded him .

a chambermaid was standing in the passage looking perplexed .
walking slowly along her garden that evening with the usual feelings of vexation rising in her , miss marple considered the point again .
she is violently jealous partly because your wife is a good-looking woman , sophisticated , and well poised , which is a thing girls often resent because they frequently lack confidence in themselves .

and very thoughtful for others .

franklin told you .

lady tressilian shook her head .
funny , after she was dead i never thought of greta muchafter id killed her she didnt seem to matter any more .
damn the smooth little brute , he had smiled !
after that , when you have satisfied yourself that you could walk out of this place at any minute you like , come back , sit in that comfortable chair over there and tell me all about yourself .
it will be diverted , as is usual on these occasions to bindley heath , clarissa interrupted him .
he would like to know .
oh , i dont mind , said lucy .
the window in the drawing-room was open .
oliver and michael weyman and alec legge were wandering about all over the place no alibis of any kind .
ratchett .

superintendent battle had opened proceedings by making a brief and businesslike report .

yes , as you say , from the ritz .
arthur calgary bought an ice-cream carton from her .
he appeared to grudge us our holiday .
she shook her head slowly .
good afternoon !
jealousy , he thought , plays the dickens with women .
as he came up to her , she turned and wished him good morning .
another point was absolute punctuality for the crowning meal of the day .
calgary was silent for some moments .
ah , well , i shouldnt be surprised if she were the one .
and we read that bitabout a woman whose price was above rubies .
in fact i never really settled down , if you know what i mean .

by all means , monsieur giraud , if you wish , said the magistrate coldly .
what can i do for you , mr .
as far as we could learn she knew nothing about it .
people do brood over bygone wrongs sometimes .
i left it behind in the end , because everyone was attached to it , and it was moved into the main sitting-room .
i mean , i dont think there were any goings-on , as you might say .
she would go out now to a chemists shop .
the suggestion took the doctor somewhat aback .
so far , hastings , he said , they laugh .
of course shes irish .
at nine oclock henry and mr jones will be here .
if it was someone else , why did they want to involve miss pebmarsh ?
i know why you say that , she cried .
i said , sounding suitably astonished .
as a matter of fact she does , monsieur poirot .
about _num_ : _num_ mrs .
then how do you account for this note , sir , which was found in the dead girls pocket ?
one of these people thatwell , its not as bad as it is nowadays because that , you must remember , was before people began getting all this violence idea .
sir bartholomew will be deeply regretted .
always had taste for acting and distinguished himself in that way at oxford .
the silly clinging fool !
that means there is much work to be done , and truly there is much that is still obscure to me .
and yet women were afraid of him .
lee , said colonel johnson kindly but briskly .
thats not quite true .
i suppose i must have looked surprised , for he suddenly burst out laughing .
to study three young and charming women , all so different from one another .

august , said megan .
its such a pompous name , thats why i remember .

lord edgware , who rose to receive us , was a tall man of about fifty .
i cant see why , i said , rather nettled .
all the same , it must have been exciting !
im afraid of his eyes .
you know its not too easy all sitting round and looking at each other as things are .
marbury was standing in the doorway of the room , clearly devoured with curiosity .
certain things she said rang strangely .
i dont know this , of course , inspector neele , but im pretty sure about it .
she gave a sharp half-glance at tommy , but tommy was talking to emma boscowan .
it was detective-inspector lejeunes suggestion if i remember rightly .
good morning , deveril , said the police officer .
but its so easy , isnt it , to make a mistake of one day ?
its raining , you know .
victim ?
you actually saw him leave .

the boys voice rose shrill and clear .
keep the engine going , and be ready to scoot like hell when i give the word .
they take days sometimes , said sir george , to find some miserable kid whos run off and hidden himself in a haystack .
that will give me a chance of getting inside and studying the geography of the place .
where have they been murdered ?
he held it now for a moment or two while he stood scrutinizing her closely .
she spoke quickly and breathlessly .
he wiped his brow in a harassed manner .
the invitation had been accepted by all .
back in his own room he added one line to his memorandum .
he went and sat at a table against the extreme wall , and immediately a waiter darted forth .
it was put there by someone else deliberately to throw suspicion on her .
this is serious , edward , really serious .
poirot sighed and said nothing .
it was half past two .
here we are , he confirmed as he took the autographs from the envelope and handed them to sir rowland , who had now closed whos who .
the lights getting worse .
but thats impossible , of course .
come now , tell me what happened .
i can tell you for sure in a minute or two .
the eyes were a deep vivid blue , the hair black .
i couldnt go on avoiding explanations forever .
same thing with the ladder itself .
in it was a bundle of faded letters and a folded paper .
she did not drown herselfshe was murdered .
mary gave a squeal of joy and clapped her hands .
id rather lost myself in a car wandering around the lanes .
bantry now .
' you arrived this morning at what time ?
elizabeth whittaker was standing there .
he couldnt see it at night .
then she saw nadines eyes fixed on her .

i knew whose they were , of course .
i dont believe in them .

sir charles whistled .
oh , why didnt we knowwhy didnt we guess ?
he was expecting the asiatic oil people this afternoon .
nothing there that sounded likely ; then i began on the ps , and almost at once i came towhat do you think ?
one of those sirops you like so much .
and following so quickly one upon the other !
sugden said quickly : we know she didnt do that .
he drew two letters from his pocket .
the grass was long there so that i realized how it was that the colonel had not seen her clearly and had only distinguished movements in the grass .
probably she was the one who planned the whole thing .
poirot , you are not serious !
no , you do not understand madame at all .
) but she was at least sixty-fiveperhaps more .
but he had confided that knowledge to one other person .
i longed to see china and japan and india and hawaii , and a great many other places , but my dream remained , and probably always would remain , wishful thinking .
but poirot did not answer .
the night before last aera friend of mine came to dine .
that sounds promising .
i know everything , monsieur .
i dont know what you mean , sir .
i accompanied her downstairs .
theres only one person ive been able to check up on .
tell me more .
these things are sent to try us , superintendent battle assured her .
the war was over .
i wanted to ask mr .
it was known that edward had secured victoria her job and several pairs of jealous dark eyes looked at her without undue affection .
but flus flu , and you cant ignore it when its there .
apart from his reference to major burnaby , he didnt speak of expecting anyone that afternoon ?
now what do you think that points to ?
that seems pretty obvious then .
whether any of this irrelevant matter would be of use , he had no idea .
let no one be blamed for my deathmary barton .
i promised pam , you see , id never say a word to a soul .
rather a gloomy place i should imagine .
harold determined that he would set about learning german .
one could not doubt that you and he were of the same family .
village parallel , please ?
i have made my investigations and failed !
let us talk of a less painful subject .
naturally i didnt approach the principals .
she saw several possible residences in devonshire but nothing that she felt was exactly right .
i waited breathlessly .
she thought : i cant bear iti cant bear itits not imaginationits true roddyroddy i cant lose you .
what about that ?
it certainly seems very absorbing , he observed .
this first-class donkey .
i am , as you may know , said poirot , a detective .
and aunt mildred said , mother .
liars !
i said it oughtnt to be any more difficult to do .
the bushes were thin at that point and the dog could be easily seen .
i only wondered what on earth the girl could have been doing .
aqua calda certainly ought to be cold waternot hot .
someone you know , he said to superintendent spence .
just a little in the bottom of the bottle ?
they were in rusty black with their faces hidden .
rustington found him so .
and after that hed gone straight ?
when he does do so , it is too late for m .
no dead woman lying across the bed .
id like to show you what is it , mother ?
farr , he said .
said lydia .
iperhaps i might come one day .
poirot said slowly : it is difficult to know just how to present the matter .
but there was a new independence about her , a new confidence in herself which i could hardly feel was simply because she was a year older .
you must look at women with quite a different eye from ordinary men , said miss marple , smiling pleasantly .
he took richard by the shoulders .
but i was no match for poirot .
' ' that ' s it , ' said the inspector .

the old ladys eyes twinkled , but she protested modestly .

it is much morehow shall i say ?
it was a considerable surprise to me to discover that laurence brown was a magnificent teacher .

emily was always ready to see anybody .
now observe my actions .
she often took to it in the early forties and spent a pleasant life , waited on hand and foot , given affectionate consideration by her devoted husband and ungrudging service by her daughters .
i see that here , he said , as he looked round the walls .
i dont care for the type myself .
i went for a walk .
that , said poirot softly , is the question .
no idea who the woman is ?
it is not dans son caractre , and when you have said that you have said everything .
the adventure of the western star _num_ .
oh , i should say so .
so convenient , murmured miss marple .
burton-cox _num_ dr .

the boots of albert continued to be active on the floor above .
i am suggesting that you were in the pavilion on sunday morning after twelve oclock when gudgeon brought the glasses out .
oh , good morning , said lord caterham .
it is as inspector crome says , agreed poirot .
gladys cram , said miss marple , with great emphasis .
i shall return by a later train .
so someone deliberately wanted to poison her ?
it is your belief , then , that this demoiselle from the milk shop is not speaking the truth ?
i thought it waited here twenty minutes , i said .
meadowes .
its definitely biblicalbut done by someone who wasnt quite sure what the words he wanted to remember were very oddthe whole thing .
but of course im a dull stick , no getting away from it .
that must have been most vexing , i said .
of course , i know , said lily apologetically , how very valuable your time is .
i cant imagine anything more unlike henry .
she had left everything she possessed to her daughter .
the experiment could only be fair this way .
clever in his profession , they say .
she was anointing it with some unguent .
i have a horror of doing anything conspicuous .

rycroft said severely : silence .
poirot did not answer for a moment or two ; then he took his hands from his temples , sat very upright and straightened two forks and a salt-cellar which offended his sense of symmetry .
why , that m-m-must have been w-w-w-wales .
its got to be divided up when he dies .
bobby winced slightly as he and george arbuthnot made faint recognitions of each others presence .
poirot said , your husband , madame ?
is it true that she had some very valuable jewellery stolen ?
there is something i want to ask you , he said .
happy the wooing thats not long doing .
and after a murder one has to put up with certain things which might not be very pleasant at ordinary times .
perhaps , monsieur , he murmured , you are aware by whomerthis letter was written ?
would you like miss gilchrist ?
coppins paused for breath and looked at lejeune with some displeasure .
i was only ragging you !
mrs pebmarsh , the blind owner of no .
thats understandable , said craddock .
i wanted , not to confront her with her guilt , but to get her to admit it herself .
i dont really think i could ever murder anybody .
a type that would exaggerate her ailments .
poirot stirred his tea cautiously and took one heroic sip .
what is thought locally of him ?
whether they enjoy having confidences screwed out of them by force is another matter .
you see , the van schuyler family is so very particular and exclusive .
look here , what time did i come home last night ?
it seemed no less incredible to mr .
he took her chin in his great square hand and looked closely into her face .
but youre wrong about there being no one worthwhile .
arent wearent we a hundred times better not knowing ?
dont be upset , edward .
it is clear , therefore , that you do not understand the a b c of the position .
secret plans , evil foreigners , marvellous cars with running boards and powerful engines , the joint threats of germany and communist russia , house parties , young men wandering round with loaded revolvers and plucky young womentheyre all there by the bucketload .
she hid her face in her hands , then raised it white and quivering .
good gracious , its getting frightfully late .
she has confided in you ?
he went on : im not much good at making polite conversation before breakfast .
so she is not at enderby .
an even money chance , id say .
i could be back here by sunday evening .
because anyone can see that hes a man whos frightfully attractive to women .
you have to guess exactly how and when the blow is timed to fall and you have to be ready to step in at the exact psychological moment .
sir eustaces orders are i understood the house was to let , i said freezingly , holding out my order .
it is undoubtedly the blessed saints who stopped the train .
all the same , i think it would be better began roger .
she came into the room and poirot deduced at once that his diagnosis of worry was true enough .
i was going , said lucky , but i had such a filthy headache that at the last moment i cried off .
quin had risen .
after which he relapsed into silence for some moments .
you didnt , he said delicately , happen toeroverhear anything of what they said ?
her hands were twitching nervously .
love can make devils of men as well as angels .
' no more did i , my friend .
and then , sinister and distinct , breaking the peace of the night for good and all , two shots in rapid succession .
i mean , he added , as she looked at him inquiringly , ready money .
he was a hard nutshrewd man , though .
ten fantastic story mademoiselle angle blanche was thirty-five at a guess .
father can find someone else to play chess with , said mary shortly .
thats round by the railway yards , isnt it ?
to my utter amazement he flew into the most awful rage .
lane was vicar .
she has now to put in time till carlotta adams returns from chiswick .
gwendas eyes were on leos face .
elise was watching poirot anxiously .
savage insisted on the will being drawn up then and there .
until then i would like to stay here .
only you could do thisi love you , victoria .
still , it no doubt did me good .
she spoke aloud again , addressing the atmosphere .
i shall look out for it .
a clock on the wall registered the fact that it was after midnight .
suitably rewarding those who stood in his path , most of whom had done nothing whatever materially to add to his comfort , he was on the point of being driven off , when a small boy rushed down the steps with a letter .
and even in the middle of her evident distress and agitation she could not keep a little smile from her lips .
hilary realized suddenly the cleverness of the plan .
oh , now im sure theyll be bringing out their autograph books !
she neednt have meant this to happen , you know .
i cant really be sure .
her glance went rather wistfully towards miss marple , who said : yes , it will be a very difficult situation for you , im afraid .
supposing i tell you that he did not come in that night at twenty past nine , but at twenty past ten ?
hawkeyed , haggard , with the gambling fever in their blood .
such things havent come her way before .
i swung back to the mirror .
he said : but , my friend , according to your theory , arlena marshall had broken with this mythical man .
montgomery jones once more shook his head .
the smile faded from the millionaires face .
slowly , because her legs were suddenly very tired .
i didnt realise .
the south african mail boat docks at southampton tomorrow , and on board her is a man who has come specially from africa at my request and who has carried out certain orders of mine .
lane to come here .
i hope not to trespass on your time unduly .
oh , its you .
does nobody else in the house have a key ?
let us now go into the dining room .
but at least the delphiniums knew a temporary deliverance .
i suppose , said tommy , you meanhe stands formoney .
do you think katherine will be upset ?
llewellyn-smythe had probably acknowledged in her own mind that she owed a great deal to rowena , and had at the same time resented what she had no doubt thought of as her bossy ways .
i can see , of course , that it would be perfectly possible to stab the old boy .
we heard it going down the waste from this wing , thats all , and thats when i said what i did to elsie .
i didnt really think he would be .
lord caterham felt reprieved , but slightly surprised .
there were other figures now at the door of the sheep foldblue uniformed figures .
then there is the matter of the footprints in the flower bed .
there is nothing personal about them .
after all , she and ii did not finish the sentence .
i was not at alderbury very longtwo years and a halfbut i always cherish the belief that i helped to stimulate her mind and encourage her taste for archaeology .
) toe .
it was eight oclock .
yes , there are things i should like to ask you .
inglethorp bolt the door after you ?
i know things it would be wise for you to know .
there were very few people on the platform and nobody i knew .
but i keep a sharp lookout .
well , after all , the situation bristles with difficulties .
this is room _num_ .
its a furniture depository place really , but they rent me a bit of space .
and just out of curiosity i picked it up and opened it .
sincerity has that effect , said miss marple .
and other words of that nature .
miss brewis might just have done it .
nicholson had a dark-blue talbot .
but as poirot said nothing more , he himself went on : seems pretty obvious mother was a pest !
she seems to want to .
curle .
the queen , who was celebrating her eightieth birthday that year , had asked the bbc to commission a radio play from agatha christie , and three blind mice was the result .
she died not long afterwards .
intellectual snobbery seems today to breed a particular form of envy and venom .
it is the only hope .
an ordinary kitchen knife .
and theres under the red robe , too .
tell her some story .
there is one other possibility .
elsa hardt and her husband , or brother or whatever he really is , come from new york , and take a flat in the name of mr .
he stared at the rucksacks .
ah , that was indeed a triumph .
curried chicken and rice .
well , said poirot , i see your dilemma .
you may have been unaware of it , monsieur , said poirot quietly , but i think it was true .
aunt ada .
the squirrel , my good georges , collects nuts .
idid youwhat happened ?
i want to change my mind , if i may , and accept your kind invitation .
at all these houses , and indeed at practically every house in chipping cleghorn , he delivered every friday a copy of the north benham news and chipping cleghorn gazette , known locally simply as the gazette .
so far she had staked prudently on colour or on one of the dozens .
his hair was very black and shining , and his teeth were aggressively white .
you want my professional opinion that what you need is sea air i knew youd understand , said miss marple gratefully .
elvira spoke without much hope .
oh , i was a lousy actress .
it was just like a bad melodrama , poirot felt , his own irritation mounting .
satterthwaite , as she resumed her progress .
and then , her eyes shifting to a point behind major riddle .
but if so , then the maid must be an accomplice .
after tea meredith had a hurried word with me .
all very undignified , i assure you .
you know it is my weakness i like to keep my little secrets till the end .
i am interested in picturesand likewise in first editions .
renisenb picked it up and stood looking at it as it lay on the palm of her hand .
quite so , quite so , said poirot , in a preoccupied voice .
whyi believeim almost sure that is a curio given to mr .
no , no , pas la guerrea memory of my days in the police force , a bullet of a rascally apache .
natural enough , too , if you only think about it .
that was james reilly .
poirot pointed to a round irregular stain on the polished surface of the writing-table .
all right , dinah sweet , keep your head .
i could tell you a lot more .
thesiger would have an explanation .
do you think mrs .
mcginty , died .
ii tuppence put down her empty coffee cup and settled back in her chair .
are you a man of good observation , doctor sheppard ?
what happened at that luncheon ?
then there was young hailey preston dodging about that day , doing his stuff .
she has not mentioned her reasons to me .
well , well , there was an accidentand harry is married to another woman now .
norton played , hastings , like a virtuoso on all these themes .
she was like a different woman for weeks afterwards .
she went on , do you ever find life dull here , eleanor ?
japps search was quick but efficient .
it has been rather upsetting , admitted the young lady cautiously .
were going over to merediths to teadont you remember ?
really , of course , because i knew some people once called kelso and some other ones called mabberley , and they were very alike .
even to marry a film star .
of course her family she shook her head .
she still carried the ragged black aba she had snatched up .
it is only more difficult .
miss carroll flushed angrily .
were going down to the country tomorrow .
it had been raining all day , he began smoothly , and then it suddenly cleared up .
madame looks ravishing in the eau de nil satin , suggested elise , her professional instincts reasserting themselves .
ii after some hesitations i decided that i ought to sound judith on the subject of allerton .
nothing here likely to help us .
that is the name of the present owner .
and what did mrs .
well , i suppose you might look at it that way .
i separate it from the last , because jealousy may not , necessarily , be a sexual emotion .
he was , i suppose , a very ordinary young man .
id completely forgotten that .
the yew tree and the moss-grown stones .
has madame then risen so early ?
thats what it ismurder .
then he turned back to face jeremy .
twenty-four years , monsieur .
there are no lethal weapons or drugs in the possession of any of us five .
and it doesnt seem to do much good either .
he repeated his former statement .
he started making desultory conversation .
if there was significance in the words , giles did not apparently notice them .
she wanted to get a message to you very badly .
but it was so hot !
so she too was a possible answer .
well , henet , and what do you think of my choice ?
when she got up to her mother-in-law and found her dead with a mark of a hypodermic syringe on her wrist she would naturally jump to the conclusion that her husband had committed the deedthat her announcement of her decision to leave him had produced a reaction in him different from that for which she had hoped .
nothing was ever found out about this man .
i wasnt thinking of suicide .
we dont always notice what the other ones doing and we certainly havent got time to talk to each other .
it seemed to her a very long time since the day when she had first sat here , soon after her return to her fathers house .
and clever too .
said : lets start a few new hares in the city .
a child could do it .
what you were asking me about the other day concerning my godchild , celia ravenscroft .
he took the picture , handed it down the staircase with instructions to someone below to do it up again .
do you hate him too , or are you so devoted to him that you dont want to share him ?
asked graham .
cried tommy .
well toast tomorrows breakfast sausages and share the chocolate mousse between us .
he wrote down the twelve names arranged in his own order of merit , then he wrote them down again this time placing one from the top and one from the bottom of the list alternately .
by and by he would return , beckon you towards him , take you up marble stairs of great magnificence , and lead you to some presumably sacred door .
he neither flinched nor paled , just stared at her with unabated interest .
she turned her head away , so that he should not see the sudden pain in her eyes .
laura warwicks poise began to break .
edward she saw at rare intervals , since he was always being sent to far-off places by dr .
no , i said slowly , struck by his words .
very likely , but who knows ?
she shook him harder .
most of the blinds were down , but occasionally the occupants of the carriages were visible .
let me get in .
you are in haste to be gone , mademoiselle ?
but he was clever enough to get away with it .
the fingers of the right hand were clasped round a small pistol .
but weve got to take every precaution .
from her words that morning , she had resented nannies criticisms of her .
joyful , contented , triumphant and silvery laughter echoed through the room .
he fussed .
then we must not look for the solution of the mystery there .
every patient , before mr .
i like to think so , said the general .
father begins it .
the old boyi suppose he is an old boy ?
i remain with assurance of my excellent sentiments , martine crackenthorpe craddock was silent for a moment or two .
rupert bateman , who was sir oswalds private secretary , went out the other way , through the window where jimmy thesiger was still lounging amiably .
cayman and she said , funny , hes the dead spit of a gentleman i used to be in service with .
the murderer is someone who didnt know about the quarrel and that mr .
you need have no fears on that score .
yes , indeed , and thats true , agreed the other .
archie and i were poles apart in our reactions to things .
it was very sad really , because he was truly religious , though inclined to be evangelical in his views .
as she unlatched the gate , a two-seater car swept past , and the driver , a girl in a red hat , waved a greeting .
on this island ?
oh yes , sir , angell assured him .
have you murdered her , too ?
someone is hoaxing us , cried dr .
though for many years she had had pains on and off .
evelyn spoke as though there had been the question .
ive been trying to find something for her to doi believe there are several things one can learn by correspondence .
but what conceivable reason could there have been ?
whatever did matron say ?
it was tenanted first by an old gardener and his wife .
as the door closed behind them , mrs .
her eyes , dark and snapping , gleamed with a wicked pleasure .
odd , said m .
ii vera claythorne spoke in a trembling voice .
it just said that the fancy tart id brought down with me wasnt my sisternot alf !
_num_ in storyteller magazine , march _num_ .
kemp said slowly : remarkably littlebut what there is isnt too good .
thats what he said it was , said miss marple .
i was fond of the young clodes , mary and george , and i realized that this mrs .
christie was first married to archibald christie and then to archaeologist sir max mallowan , whom she accompanied on expeditions tocountries that would also serve as the settings for many of her novels .
thirteen summary of the passengers evidence a small dark man with a womanish voice , said m .
theyre taking the master away .
indeed , he had had the idea that she did not smoke at all .
shes quite old and ugly as sin , really , but what does it matter .
oliver sounded at sea .
check up on staff generally .
' ' the whole thing is a mare ' s nest !
its just something someone mentionedbut i must have got it all wrong .
as he teed up on the next tee , he glanced at his watch .
i do not think he sleeps very well in his grave .
if i mistake not , now that we are on the track , other evidence will come to light .
at any rate , i remarked , you will have one bee less in your bonnet now .
she sent it reply paid .
oh , people always say things , said lola vaguely .
hardcastle nodded and picked up the small travelling clock with rosemary written across the corner .
you played into his hands nicely when you gave him the code .
lewis serrocold sorted out another letter .
at last he sighed and recrossed his legs and began : it is a little difficult for me to select just the kind of thing you want , but i think , as it happens , i know of an instance which fits these conditions very aptly .
he was a nice old boy and he was good to us and did as much as he could to help us here .
there is such a thing as unconscious self-revelation , though .
there is no error in them .
she looked at jason rudd .
i cant leave .
your eyelids are closing .
you go along there .
poirot was in a position to ask questions that would have been regarded with suspicious hostility twenty minutes earlier .
its the patterson gang .
see for yourself , monsieur .
in this case , he had a firm grip of the lapel of lord caterhams coat .
and you see where that leaves us .
ive no time to waste being ill , said my mother .
but the result will be that whoever feels most strongly will end by converting all the rest .
oh , of courseyour father he frowned .
no groans or cries or nothing like that .
i dont know that i am .
crump drew back to let her in .
that was me , said gwenda firmly .
plans of a submarine sold to someone or other .
well , for heavens sake , dont look so glum .
he fancied that poirot grudged him the credit resulting from the successful elucidation of the affair .
fullerton thought , had found her .
rather to miss marples surprise the alighting passenger was bess sedgwick whom she had seen go up only a minute or two before .
you know , mary , even here nevile has had the devils own luck .
i myself , or hastings here but tell me just what occurred .
or shall we put it , honest but expensive .
inside were pigeonholes and little drawers .
immediately after that very awkward chaffing reference to ellis being the perfect butlerthat extremely uncharacteristic utterance of sir bartholomew strange .
serrocold only arrived just before dinner this evening .
he could understand well enough from remarks he had heard from spences sister , from hints of what other people had said and from various other sources , that rowena drake was that dominant type of personality whom everyone expects to run the show , and whom nobody has much affection for while she is doing it .
he was all over meespecially as he thought from my clothes that i had money .
that dress would clean all right .
he was looking at me with an indescribable expression , his eyes green and shining .
and i shall admit nothing .
he murmured ecstatically .
no sex appeal about it .
and her lying there helpless ?
through his almost-closed eyelids he reconnoitred carefully .
she was thereat daniellis .
anthony eyed him keenly .
oliver , the well-known detective writer , was going to be there autographing her own books .
tell me just what happenedwhat you think happened , on that evening .
a friend of his used to bring it him from america .
its not fairnot fair .
but one thing she did have in common with herthough a cheerful person , she always expected the worst of everyone and everything , and was , with almost frightening accuracy , usually proved right .
can you get me a sleeper ?
well , i shant either , said dr graham .
he replaced the receiver , hesitated , then rang mrs .
first his flat had been searched , and now he himself might have been marked down .
is it not too strong ?
i was so glad to be able to give her some rest , some happiness , i wished she would stop working , but of course she felt it her duty in wartime , and she still seems to feel she should go on .
what are you writing down there ?
miss marple had finished the fleecy knitting and was now engaged with a crochet hook and a ball of cotton .
you went back into that room because youd left your gloves there , you said .
llewellyn-smythes letters for her and it seems mrs .
a mighty fine escape .
the man departed .
damn it all !
queer what tricks ones eyes play on one .
carrge looked pained .
pensions dont go far nowadays , but we do pretty comfortably living together .
she was a tall , thin woman with dark hair , rather prominent light boiled gooseberry eyes and a worried face .
maman , whispered marthe : i must go .
play , said betty .
and , of course , people do think that what mrs spenlow was wearing was rather peculiar .
i sent dorothy off for the doctor , and cook and i stayed with him , but after a few minutes i couldnt bear it any longer ; it was too dreadful .
i followed her as she led the way out to the converted barn .
shed gone up without thinking but coming down did for her .
always so damned pleased with themselves .
had he had a prophetic knowledge of what was going to happen ?
lazarus , i exclaimed .
most people dont .
but she did not believe her own wordsdid not believe for one moment that the calm blonde woman was an irresponsible lunatic .
you cant help not liking people if theyre not nice people .
tones , overtones , half-tones .
you mean miss henderson paused .
evidently she did .
surely theyd got the temperature too high ?
you , said macwhirter .
oh now , that is a good thing , exclaimed elsie holland .
a pair of scissors .
madeleine de sara was the most seductive of vamps .
and a third one of beautiful muscats .
iwell reallyi dont know .
did you show them into the drawing room ?
but its true .
i suppose youll want the latest ones ?
what is it you want me to do ?
and she is , i may say , a very persistent person .
the window was open , the gate of his cage unlatched .
the passenger space in the little monoplane was limited , and the small width of the seats was not such as to accommodate the bulk of mr .
the porter here noticed you walking down the road towards yewtree lodge .
chantry wont give her up .
kennedy arrived punctually .
toto this fellow farrar began , and then stopped as they both noticed starkwedder walking along the terrace outside the windows .
there was a figure ahead of himthe tall graceful figure of madame grandier .
we should have taken that as an omen .
she had a girlish adoration for him , but he could never touch the womanhood in herand that drove him mad .
just because she left their old tennis party a bit early .
at the same time , with the other hand i pulled down the washbasin .
he bowed them both to the door .
they strolled down to the lake together .
it had one object , and one object only : that audrey strange should be hanged by the neck till she was dead .
she pressed forward a dish of sandwiches , and tuppence helped herself .
youve always known , havent you , about everything youve met in life ?
some ridiculous practical joke .
he waited a minute and then went on : a new life that is what elinor carlisle is beginning nowand it is you who have given her that life .
tom betterton evidently thought it might be so .
wewe didnt mean any harm .
they seemed to wait for ages out on the airfield .
you dont know that you cant , mother pointed out , because youve never tried .
where did you meet him ?
you come down to ansteys and see if its simple !
a series of terraces led down to it from the hotel .
her mother ran away and caused a scandalremember ?
luttrell had just said was in all probability the literal truth .
you snatched it up , he reminded her .
i thought it did , said mr .
miss marple sounded alert .
i should put it this way .
the prisoner , returning to the house on tuesday evening , had been authoritatively told that there had been a violent quarrel between mr .
bland heartily .
many have tried to copy her but none has succeeded .
helped out by questions from sir james , he gave an abbreviated account of his adventures .
well , said tommy , picking up the daily mail again , do it .
explain the circumstances , hand over the necklace , and give the number of his own car .
unexpected , perhaps .
he called them his children .
i want to be with you and see our house going up brick by brick as soon as santonix gets there .
borden and his wife were struck down by blows of an axe on a sunday morning .
he paused and then remarked abruptly : what was it that i just saidnot my last remarkthe one before ?
good afternoon , madam , he began .
will be very expressive .
none of these is the man i saw last night .
nothing more , nothing more , lord caterham assured them hastily .
he looked round on them and nodded his head .
charles seemed anxious not to meet his sisters eye .
protheroe did some ordering at the grocers and at the fish shop , and from there came straight down the back lane where miss marple saw her .
miss waterhouse allowed herself to show a faintly pleasurable reaction to this compliment .
tell me , miss carnaby , did you ever have to carry out the threats you used in your letters ?
so much did she concede to the etiquette of the situation .
one really feels quite bilious looking at his pictures .
we hurried down the stairs .
sir henry , courteous and polished , had moved forward to her .
come to think of it , these words we throw around dont mean much .
how long have you got of it ?
i suspected the truth , esa .
the fourteenth , murmured the clerk ; that is rather soon .
yes , you are right .
this means that somebody saw the possibility of using the opening phrase of her letter to youto suggest something very different .
miss marple picked up the manuscript and began to read .
if you had had my experience you would know that five persons account of the same thing will differ so widely as to be almost incredible .
one of his partners , who had been standing near , moved nearer to him .
i never do put things in places .
the one as lives in the cottages in the village .
satterthwaite had seen him last .
so that is still your solution ?
she hesitated a little before going in .
i am a busy man .
lombard said doubtfully : it couldnt , i suppose , have been an accident ?
it was the duplicate of the box i held , save for the fact that this time the box was blue and the lid was pink .
look at that face .
im waiting for him .
rich and plebeian and frightfully stupid outside business , i should think , but probably dead sharp in it .
rather odd , he murmured .
you do not as yet know , lady eileen , what it is you are refusing .
in the end , he descended ignominiously and finished the journey on a diminutive donkey .
perhaps youve changed your mind ?
and i always think , colonel race , that men are so much better judges of other men .
he suggested to her repeatedly that it was four-thirty , and not four oclock when she heard the voices .
on his return to the house , he found mrs pritchard in a state of great agitation .
his good-natured face wore an unaccustomed frown of anger .
he made a movement towards her but she warded him off .
indeed , he felt the first act had hardly been played yet .
the inspector had risen .
youre a wonderful teacher .
i dont know at all , said miss marple .
behind this business , i am convinced , there is a cool , intelligent , resourceful brain .
whos the next ?
pamela wasnt going to woolworths , was she ?
he read it through in silence , then he looked up at me .
yes , from the carlton hotel , london .
the good mrs .
she called over her shoulder and presently the girl lily came in to relieve her .
youre coming to london with me and when ive done with you you wont know yourself .
ive a feeling , you know , that our lucks changed at last .
from rosaleen there came a small miserable sob .
the food was indifferent .
do not say les btises , my friend .
copleigh , wives or mothers or fathers even .
it still seems to me quite mad .
anyone else come ?
if youre thinking i did it , inspector sharpe , thats quite untrue .
come , sweetheartsee , here is your doll .
yet there must have been some reason .
and then jock .
so thats what he was after , was it ?
then theres micky .
hows your aunt ?
he said : are you suggesting that if there had been a young man in ruby keenes life , my friends attitude towards her might have altered ?
he was such a pathetic old dear .
we will do all we can to keep her name out of it , but it will be impossible to do so entirely .
so there may have been a connection between them ?
my force , hastings , is in my brain , not in my feet !
it is of no use recalling bygone days .
a new idea struck inspector craddock .
deceit !
countrified , it was .
there was a sameness about these trophies .
memory had come to him .
but i never thoughti never dreamedhow could i how indeed .
arthur badcock looked more like a chewed-out bit of string than ever .
browns methods are not so crude .
however , she promised faithfully that she would not breathe a word to colonel race , and we went on with our plan making .
young people have the courage of their ideals and convictionstheir values are more theoretical than practical .
we must lay out a little course , said lord caterham , addressing a daisy .
tell me more about the people in the houses there , i said , and what you see .
bacon grunted again .
that and displaying the wonderful amount of trades that he managed to combine among his various services to the community in which he lived .
he said to melchett : youre the chief constable of radfordshire ?
and nowon to the next thing , please !
there was a kind of cool efficiency in the way she was eating her breakfast and in the way she called to the attendant to bring her more coffee , which bespoke a knowledge of the world and of travelling .
youre all right , arent you ?
i would like you , miss jacobs , to tell me in your own words exactly what you saw and heard .
the analyst was asked by him to report whether strychnine was , or was not , present .
yes , admitted gerard .
regard the irises , he remarked in a rather loud voice .
hed never had any hopenot any real hope .
when was i taken ill ?
she is the daughter of amyas and caroline crale .
shall i send one of the maids to you ?
she is really fond of him , i know she is .
it was no longer the station wagon .
we know what that end was , because the letters were read out in court .
miss chadwick sounded a little unsure .
she was interested , was she ?
for the last twelve years or so , said miss blacklock with a slight twinkle , ive had an excellent motive for murdering mrs .
murder in mesopotamia ( _num_ ) nurse amy leatheran had never felt the lure of the mysterious east , but she nonetheless accepts an assignment at hassanieh , an ancient site deep in the iraqi desert , to care for the wife of a celebrated archaeologist .
lots of money !
it was all a long time ago .
bruce ingram wanted a series of twelve stories .
there were sounds of bolts and locks , of the moving of furniture .
that part of leahampton was known to house agents as the least desirable end .
i sat at the piano , and i didnt leave the piano until dear jolly came in with some rusty old keys and tried to fit one to the lock of the study door .
her shadow was welcome to see where she went and what she did .
there have been other places where we have stopped or through which we have passed , but special arrangements were made so that you should actually stay for a couple of nights here .
dispassionately , like a general planning a campaign , or an accountant assessing a business , miss marple weighed up and set down in her mind the facts of and against further enterprise .
but of course , once we were all in the servants hall , right the other side , we didnt hear anything at all .
i never saw him do it .
leidners room , killed her , and then called the boy back .
so you feel like that ?
i heard it from a friend of hers .
hed heard , somehow , in the city .
tim kendal frowned .
leidners story _num_ saturday afternoon _num_ an odd business _num_ i didnt believe .
she gave renisenb a glance which seemed to contain a certain scornful irony .
the mans gaunt face registers poirot for a moment , and then he collapses .
from four oclock no one had set eyes on lady stubbs .
she designed me , you know , for the conservatoire .
at any rate shes got a got a steady boyfriend , has she ?
he can get up .
we prepared to keep a nice , unobtrusive eye on mrs .
it makes you feel more and more inadequate .
the person who did not share my enthusiasm was the wretched max .
the question in the murderers mind will be , did she voice them to anybody when she first heard of richards death ?
so that you think weve got to accept what he says ?
lord caterham beat a precipitate retreat without waiting for a reply .
annoyed at this latest interruption , the inspector turned slowly and looked at the sergeant .
he turned and in a different tone of voice , an apologetic everyday voice , he said : a magnificent performance , sir charles , i congratulate you .
vandemeyer is trying to hook it .
jane looked at him more attentively .
i should think someone had gone out , i suppose .
and his glance swept quickly over janet rustington .
colonel easterbrook knelt down .
as for philip durrant , he seemed uneasy .
were you expecting a visitor ?
im afraid it may be rather unpleasant for you .
she was hungry and enjoyed her lunch .
the number on it , for better or worse , was no .
the hall was low and dark with a twisting staircase leading up from it .
well , i just wondered if youdyoull forgive me , wont you ?
i am incriminating myself !
of course , said tuppence , ive seen things like that before when i was young .
lily margraves voice was very scornful .
the same design - a triangle .
ive been hanging up my overcoat .
i suppose you had to do it .
but she sat there , motionless , for a long time .

that same evening , charles again being absent , mrs .
nine times out of ten its a case of good old sex .
i dont know , but they say as your blood grows the wrong colour or something .
the canon had taken his bag to the airport , had been turned away from the airport .
by jove , he nearly did for her !
it was all tuppence could do to restrain her jubilation .
he said , you dont want me to go to prison , do you ?
she made the coffee and took it out to the porch where they often sat on fine evenings .
weve plenty of time .
after a minute or two she said : do you thinkwould you likei wonder if shed like to come and stay with us for a day or two ?
and the house is fond of us .
two men in a bakers van were witnesses of the accident .
alistair blunt stirred a little in his chair .
they have nothing to do with each other .
i wish youd calm down , phil .
ratchett received the last threatening letter ?
hes running like mad .
you want me to hush it up , then ?
he said that there had been trouble lately .
anthony became suspicious .
we have to start immediately after lunch .
as miss bunner has just told you she was frightened to death when she saw that advertisement in the gazette .
theres a skylight in the next room .
now , doc , i went on , will you be frank with me ?
lets see where we are .
a small page boy was waiting outside her own door when she returned to it .
would it be possible to climb over ?
he was a delicate man .
you know what they saythat i may not get well ?
it is deplorable , said m .
but hed have to come up from the causeway past the hotel .
instead you will come away with me .
i suppose because she does not trust you ?
i meant to go to old mr .
then he began : im not ebenezer farrs son .
campbell clark in a pleasant voice .
iii the five people sitting round the table seemed to find conversation difficult .
miss blacklock reflected a moment .
only , he added , it quite often isnt anything to do with the business in hand .
youd think so , i agreed .
he nodded his head several times and went out of the room , leaving carla staring after him .
oh , we all drifted apart later .
everything , sir , was very much as usual .
' ' did he speak toyou about his dream ?
miss bennett moved around the desk , but looked towards the door .
henry looked pleased .
parker pyne was roused .
you mustnt be frightened , my dear .
so we went over to greenway , and very beautiful the house and grounds were .
come outside , he said softly .
from what youve told me im fairly sure of that .
hardcastle was looking up at the photographs on the wall .
hes got a pretty taste in love songs , too .
there were one or two good old family portraits on the walls , and some bad victorian watercolours , and some would-be-funny hunting scenes .
i enjoyed writing the miss marple stories very much , conceived a great affection for my fluffy old lady , and hoped that she might be a success .
if only my father could have died without ever knowing .
hercule poirot said : all along , all the way through , i have been led astraysometimes unwittingly , sometimes deliberately and for a purpose .
why , do you think there might be ?
then there was red ware , of an earlier period and grey ware , both plain and not painted .
it is ridiculous that you should ask me to come here and wish to ask me questions .
to put it in perfectly plain language he was what i would describe as an old dodderer .
kenneth marshall said : seemed to be sitting in the chief constables pocket all right the other day .
yes , i am your aunt .
he is still asleep , and i dont want to disturb him .
on the pretext of summoning her mistress , she runs upstairs , slips on a bright jumper and a hat with black curls attached which she jams down over the grey transformation .
what a monstrous idea !
well , i suppose it is just a draft .
i felt a bit guilty sometimes , but it wore off , fairly soon .
miss marple was born at the age of sixty-five to seventywhich , as with poirot , proved most unfortunate , because she was going to have to last a long time in my life .
he has not been identified .
a very charming-looking old lady with white hair came into the room holding a glass of milk .
yes , but they dont happen often .
i did not steal the diamonds !
he was afraid of wasps .
what would a woman look like in such circumstances ?
she retraced her steps back to the marquee .
he paused and then went on : i will start my journey at the moment when i myself was brought into the casewhen i had it presented to me as an accomplished happening .
battle turned to isaacstein with one laconic word : oil ?

she went to get married .
still , i gather she had already left when the catastrophe occurred .

she replied characteristically : no , indeed i havent .
everybody appears to be in the expected state of nervous agitation , high excitement , general fatigue , and strong irritation , which are characteristic of preparations for this form of entertainment .
he demanded : are you mad , or am i ?
remember , in this game , results are few and far between .
it tells you what it is that has driven her to take her own life .
rather gingerly , and in a way rather ashamed of his melodramatic fancy , he held it towards the bar of the electric fire but nothing resulted .
imagination , however , hercule poirot possessed in abundance .
did you know who it was the girl meant ?
apart from the smooth storytelling the other attractive feature of the book is the banter of the two main protagonists .
that domestic-service job where the deceased started her careersir robert abercrombies place .
for instancethe taxi driver .
ah , i did not say that .
lets say australia .
theres some talk of having a development of the land there .
caution !
surely it must be all right .
peace settled down on the car .
its all right , really , said molly .
tisnt as though it was the old bitch .
itsits not so simple as that .
no one has gone into the house so far .
some of the songs were not so bad .
a tactless woman .
so many things are difficult , said miss marple .
if , for instance , there had been a picture on the wall there , then , yes , there might be an explanation .
for mr .
perhaps hes going to australiatoo , said her mother , like we are .
or , im not sure as it wasnt no .
weston said : were coming downnow .
he seemed quite as usual and was actually moving one of the pieces when he suddenly fell forwarddead !
then bella brought a small green phial .
hes a very smart man .
and its believed that it wasnt the first murder hed done .
frankly , things look bad for him .
he knows that i would not do such a thing .
somehow when greta came back the strain came out again .
poirot , however , was careful to soothe her feelings tactfully .
in a forest .
thats always useful , said tuppence .
two things , i said .
jack , she faltered .
he came up to them , drew a chair forward and sat down , looking with grave interrogation at colonel johnson .
lady eileen tells me she saw the door knob of mr .
he could easily have travelled by the _num_ : _num_ , pushed the woman out of the train and caught a train back to london in time to appear at the dinner .
she was a good deal yellower of skin , she was plumper , her hair was more frivolously done , and she was less brisk in manner , but the eyes that looked out of a round and amiable countenance were the same shrewd eyes that gleamed through miss lemons pince-nez .
the rays of the midnight sun within the arctic circle have a peculiar action upon the skinthe actinic rays have certain properties .
then she got up and went into her husbands room , which for once was unlocked .
no , no , mon ami , we must be very incognito , you and i .
not clear yet by any meansbut he was on the right track .
we used to have a cat ourselves , a tabby .
was in the ouds at oxford , by the way .
oddly enough , he is not .
he listened with pleasure to the protests of the two women .
geronimo let poirot in , and recognising him as the honoured guest of two nights before , became at once voluble in a sibilant conspiratorial whisper .
that again was true , very trueif not in the sense that you understood it !
mrs fellows-brown experimented to and fro .
she always talks about being hard up , said mrs .
you have brought it on yourself were her words .
they had heard that deceased had fits of melancholy , that she was in poor health , and that while there was no organic disease , she was in a bad nervous condition .
arthur bantry ?
oh , quite out of the question , i should say .
give her a bicycle and she would go off for half an hour .
he said apologetically : criminology is rather a hobby of mine , you know .
have you heard that ?
you will see in a minute .
inspector craddock was very pleasant and friendly .
my whole life he was spluttering with excitement .
i told you there was nothing to it , said arbuthnot apologetically .
savagethe gentleman diedwhen ?
i was just a musical comedy actress in a small part when hugo met me and i thought his family curse was just too lovely for words .
it had had a cheerful , human quality .
was cicely mixed up with this woman giselle in any way ?
it was the egg-shaped head of hercule poirot , and the eyes of hercule poirot regarded with a good deal of interest the face of the young gardener who had now stopped digging and was passing a sleeve across his wet face .
it was the one place we were sure of catching him .
the riot act was read , daniel was told that he was disgraced both as a christian and a servant , that he had lowered the christian in arab eyes , and that he would no more be engaged by us .
its a record office where you can look up marriages .
how did you know that , mr .
because she cared for him ?
kay said slowly : so you havent been happy ?
it meantif anything at all was to make sensethat it was not colonel luttrell who shot mrs .
then , looking suddenly at japp , he rapped out a quick question .
louise mentioned the matter of mrs .
that girl is saneas sane as any one of you sitting here in this room !
it is in my room .
was he a good artist ?
you see , i was lost and i couldnt find don .
so i came out here to have a good cry .
judes hospital at _num_ : _num_ .
by the way , m .
have a cup of tea , ella , said marina as ella zielinsky acknowledged the introduction with a smiling pleased to meet you .
ginas laugh rang out fresh and clear .
why should arnold want to hide in the chest ?
somebody who hasnt heard the call or isnt on the plane or something like that .
fane , but it seems as she changed her mind and married the other gentleman instead .
an enormous and almost incredibly opulent cadillac , painted in two tones , raspberry fool and azure blue , swept (with difficulty owing to its length) into the drive and drew up behind major the hon .
he was in such a state of dither that it was hard to get a calm statement from him .
and thats not what im after .
presently the buzzer sounded , and a few minutes later roger leonides entered the room .
sixpence ?
what do you say , doctor ?
after a minute or two she said irrelevantly : you know , i like georgeeveryone does .
a nurse , i thought , or a maida lot of spies came over here in that capacity , and this woman was most unusual looking and walking up the road and on to the downswith a little girland the little girl seemed tired and rather lagging , and half-past seven , well , most children go to bed then , so i looked at the woman pretty sharply .
i am an oriental at heart .
there , to the little lady there .
from one of the drawers she brought out an envelope , extracted a paper from it and brought it to him .
and she said (julia produced a very good imitation of mitzis accent) : i go there and if they say to me you have to register with the policeyou are an alien , i say to them , yes , i will register !
this is howard raikes , uncle alistair .
we shall soon see if it is rubbish .
i fancy that you had seen her with john lakeyou knew how it was with them .
nom dun petit bonhomme !
he exclaimed incredulously : what ?
everything ive told you may have been lies .
f-l-o-r-e-a-t-e-t-o-n-a .
there was to be absolutely no publicity .
but surely there cant be any other explanation , inspector ?
benevolence , kindliness and charm were the most apparent qualities of his personality .
thank you for it .
im whats called a thoroughly nice girl .
does marina gregg ever use it herself ?
poirot said gravely : fundamentally , yes .
that the moth ball man had suddenly caught sight of the doctor , and that the meeting was totally unexpected and alarming to him , was another fact of which i was fairly sure .
the man is practically a limpet .
everyone was inclined to doubt whether her health would stand the strain .
sinister ?
presently , however , she stopped .
old people .
said patrick in sepulchral tones .
ive got a list here of about six .
i felt that perhaps she didnt know how stupid and unreasoning and violent jealousy and hate can beand how little it takes to set them smouldering .
he may have suspected .
i cant believe anyone didi feel it must have been some kind of accident .
time will show .
his calls became slightly absentminded .
he had no suave bedside manner , neither was he theatrical in appearance .
bullying us all like he did .
people used to come here and wish .
there was the cinema too , with a weekly episode of the perils of pamela .
and i always find storkleg so reliable .
yes , they were always shut in the afternoon .
she was looking from one to the other of them , humorous , charming !
i never thought shed done it off her own bat , said japp unblushingly .
he despised poor mrs .
i dont think my mother was socially minded , but she did yearn , as any young girl might , to have a great many prettier clothes and dresses than she had .
bundle again felt baffled .
there was nobody to notice the rather curious expression on the face of m .
i am a detective .
ten poirot left his third call until after luncheon .
light in my eyes .
occasionally her flow of conversation stopped whilst she reanointed herself from a bottle of oily fluid which stood be- side her .
im not a psychiatrist .
up to now they had probably been busy looking for possible sources of poison in the food .
eranything to suggest that idea to you ?
im going to ask you not to open it until the very last moment , midnight on the _num_ th , in fact .
i was just a bit jealous of her at first , that was all .
nearly three thousand years old that palace was , it appeared .
king victor !
he would do just that .
it wouldnt really surprise him .
he spoke to the minister in a britannic though idiomatic french .
i suspect in soho where she doubtless has underworld affiliations of her own nationality who can provide her with the necessary papers .
i do not see why anybody here should want to do harm to her .
v hester was dreaming .
unlikely , i agree .
and you see the beauty of the scheme , mr .
im sorry to have to tell you , miss ramsbottom , that your brother-in-law , mr .
i accepted it .
they were perfectly happy , i believe , until she died of pneumonia in _num_ .
suzanne sent me a cable when he was born : congratulations and love to the latest arrival on lunatics island .
they were two grave gentlemen , who had grown grey in the service of the bank .
wetterman that night .
armstrong had definitely arrived .
what a very odd thing to do !
yes , if you like to put it that way .
the true explanation leapt to the eye , did it not ?
but her evidence only lasted a few minutes .
he stood erect , squaring his shoulders .
he says they certainly didnt poison her , or anything like that , but his personal belief is that there was some funny businessthat she died as the result of neglect on their part .
she used to put em in to soak midday , and they stood there until the evening when she went to bed .
the best place , i think , would be marsden wood , she advised .
in the corner , to the right of the fireplace , was a big writing table , and sitting at it was a manor what had been a man .
thats funny , isnt it ?
he just sits back looking thoroughly pleased making plans for what hell do with rutherford hall , and he keeps saying that itll need a lot of money to develop it in the way he wants to do .
black coffee ran for a mere four or five months when it finally came to the west end , but it was revived twenty-odd years later , with minor alterations and it did quite well in repertory .
my dear mrs ross always comes in every christmas .
poirot murmured , have you seen anymore of mr .
one , i grant you , but both !
here is someone , thought hercule poirot , very remarkable .
two trees are in the line of vision .
as one grew older , so she reflected to herself , one got more and more into the habit of listening ; listening possibly without any great interest , but there had been between her and the major the gentle give and take of two old people .
what about the nurses ?
and now here you are .
they dislike newcomers .
want to see what she looked like ?
and the second questionthe pipe cleaner .
after dinner mark gaskell went out in his carto the seafront , he said .
it must have been something i saw .
' i mean to try .
tommy stood still for a minute , then hearing nothing went on .
entertaining thought that , isnt it ?
didnt seem to realize that the whole world was going through a period of crisis .
i wondered if that was why , said valerie slowly .
they had always loved hunterbury , both of them .
but you are sure , huish ?
but the police , my dear mrs .
i dont know what to doi cant go onive been so wicked .
it was tuesday evening .
and when all the records and all the papyrus rolls are destroyed and the scribes are scattered , the men who toil and reap will go on , and egypt will still live .
growled at meshowed his teeth .
indeed , she frankly admitted as much .
it seems a curious name to have for her if her real one is daphne theodofanous .
the girl was waiting for me .
there can be only two explanations of thateither dr gerard overlooked the syringe and it was never stolen , or else the syringe was taken because the murderer had not got access to the medicinethat is to say the murderer was not a member of the boynton family .
you would like , i think , to marry mademoiselle nick ?
theyve been firing shots in the room where uncle christian was killed , said gina .
for the first time , bobby felt , he was really seeing the man .
the man was a foolhe had been incredibly , unbelievably stupid .
it might arouse suspicion if you did not stay out till the usual time .
lot of cock , thought shrivenham disrespectfully .
this suitcase contains theatrical properties which i brought down here for an amateur performance .
christow , he observed at last , was a very able fellowa very able fellow .
most of the people were outside on the deck space between the observation saloon and the cabin .
oliver , rather pleasurably surprised .
all that is far behind us .
i will take the box to imhotep and tell him ill hand the box to him myself .
you did not tell the police about mrs .
bobby , she thought to herself , likes them helpless .
he was rather tired of sir georges thinking , wondering , and imagining .
angela was in some ways young for her age .
well , at any rate , shes got very good manners , said aunt matilda , which seemed a somewhat doubtful answer , the meaning of which sir stafford did not quite appreciate .
moreover there was a lot of ragging going on ; a kind of ragging i had not been used to .
and there was no one to whom she could go for advice .
deftly , poirot nipped out a paper and brought it over .
come in and make friends with her , said katherine .
i have nothing to say .
i heard that they discovered that she had cancer and they couldnt do anything about it so this happened .
latest .
hori !
all the police they have drafted inthey are taking great precautionsthey sayhave you heard ?
because if she didnt do it now , at oncetomorrow she wouldnt have the courage .
it came by the six oclock post .
oh yes , well get justice done .
blankets were folded in a neat pile , the drawers were empty , there was not so much as a hanger left in the cupboard .
he got up and left the room , returning a few minutes later .
that is what you seek , eh ?
you mean that somebody might have changed his blood pressure pills for something else , and that they poisoned him ?
you need not answer .
that is , no one came to the house at all , not the postman , nor anybody else .
his cottage is nearly all bookcases .
pearls stuffed into plaster castswhat is the storythe bust of napoleon , is it not ?
i know they are .
poirot said slowly : did miss arundell take this threat seriously ?
miss gilchrists hands began to shake and she tried to steady her voice .
it will be a terrible shock to him .
and tell me what it is .
in the big room the soft , muted notes had an almost eerie effect .
big unwieldy country houses are a drag on the market .
the inspector seated himself in the armchair , placing the gun on the table beside him .
thats ok , ma .
i mean , were all old friendsexcept miss marple , and she knows all about crime .
what amusement people can find in these painful proceedings has always been a mystery to me .
caroline peabody said : expecting any of your young people down ?
fergusons dispenser) ann reynolds joyce reynolds leopold reynolds nicholas ransom desmond holland beatrice ardley cathie grant diana brent mrs .
gipsies warnings in profusion , i said .
mary cavendish was standing where the staircase branched , staring down into the hall in the direction in which he had disappeared .
to have patience with stupidity is difficult for the quick-witted .
you see the beauty of that ?
he found lord whitfield striding up and down the drawing room .
miss marple was silent .
' well , perhaps when they ' re very young , ' conceded mr bonnington .
why didnt she speak to me ?
but his actions now were decidedly peculiar , to say the least of them .
yes , i said to him , you neednt think im going to say anything against my girls .
ohohwe couldnt .
i should think you do .
annesley ?
i suppose , said tommy , that theres no absolute necessity for a husband to be either ?
all the people will be there , and then hell tell us which of them did it .
i told miss shapland to say that wed ring him back , and sent her to find you .
you have an adventurous attitude to life , mr .
and your wife took the drink ?
funnyhed looked quite different , all of a sudden .
blakes young ladywhat comes down for the weekends with im to mr .
wasps nest out of the house came john harrison and stood a moment on the terrace looking out over the garden .
matter of fact we had a bit of a row over something .
i dont know where my wife is .
faced by a new front door in a blaze of new paint she pressed the bell .
it might , by a jury , agreed battle .
she had foreseen that bill , if not jimmy , would make objections to her participation in the possible dangers of the night .
she must have taken it herself .
peculiar drugs andwhat do they call it ?
you like gardens , dont you ?
it is the imbecility !
the doctor gazed at poirot in astonishment .
she had got a dominant , ruthless will , but he too had a will hidden beneath his meek manners .
do you see , watson ?
i do vegetables for mrs .
what will the documents show ?
do you suspectany particular person ?
that centre one there is known as heart of fire .
they came round the last cornercame to the deep pit and to something lying in it that had not been there before , the body of a woman lying in a wonderful pose , arms flung wide and head thrown back .
it is sad to think , said miss marple , that there are so many deaths all the time .
satterthwaite was too tactful to intrude upon her thoughts .
and they havent shown up .
these last were especially useful because when you went to parties you were not shamed by ignorance of such social activities .
it is as simple as that .
how many psychologists does one know to whom it might be said physician , heal thyself ?
hes one of the most positive people ive ever seen , i said .
i think there must be something in it , you know , because one doesnt let a servant go nowadays unless its something rather grave .
i said nothing then or at any time of the dreadful suspicion that had for one moment assailed my mind .
the thirteen problems by agatha christie copyright _num_ agatha christie limited (a chorion company) essay by charles osborne excerpted from the life and crimes of agatha christie .
he may have guessed what was in her mind , but i shouldnt imagine that he instigated it .
don ' t suppoge we shall ever know now who the old boy was- not even his name .
oh , darling , but you adore bathing and lazing about .
everything fitted in really , you see .
it pleased her .
quickly and noiselessly , bundle fled along the way she had come .
wellernot quite like that .
oh yes , i know .
pardon ?
should we feel like that with an ordinary woman ?
she went to all the neighbours and nursed them when they were ill .
but to return to where we were .
after breakfast he made the acquaintance of gladys , the third housemaid .
you mean , said ferguson , that im not good enough for her ?
for the moment she had even ceased to worry about her hat .
i stepped briskly down the stairs .
in this instance my attention wandered to the four people sitting at the next table .
exactly , hastings , the leg of mutton .
i think suzanne is right .
now we can all give a lovely performance of a quiet evening at home , said julia , and be quite surprised when somebody drops in .
hubbards compartment .
theres peter gaye whos a young atom scientist and hes suspected of being in the pay of the communists , and hes married to this girl , joan blunt , and his first wifes dead , but she isnt , and she turns up because shes a secret agent , or perhaps not , i mean she may really be a hikerand the wifes having an affair , and this man loyola turns up either to meet maya , or to spy upon her , and theres a blackmailing letter which might be from the housekeeper , or again it might be the butler , and the revolvers missing , and as you dont know who the blackmailing letters to , and the hypodermic syringe fell out at dinner , and after that it disappeared .
simeon snapped : the same goes for you !
im going out to pay a visit to my married daughter in iraq , miss jones .
ah , you think so ?
david might kill a blackmailerin fact , wasnt it just the way he would deal with a blackmailer ?
this had never been done before .
some women do .
she struck oil , as you might put it , when she came to the last one , which was for the year _num_ .
ill get someone onto that straightaway .
true patience ; true resignation .
i told the police sergeant , i told him what i thought we saw .
she has been extraordinarily kind and , whatever her faults , i should not like to appear to criticize her actions , orwell , to prejudice you against taking up the case .
i couldnt bear you to find out , so i went away .
first he went away and left my mother , and now , just when hes coming back to me , he goes and marries mary .
i had acquired a secondhand austin .
and they think to get rid of hercule poirot like that !
rather in a state and all about nothing at all .
thats where that forty pounds went right enough .
i want you to find out , said desmond .
never have i tasted such food as we had on that boat : delicious lamb , very tender , in little cutlets , succulent vegetables , rice , sumptuous sauce , and savoury things on skewers .
there was no one to whom i could appeal .
a craneyes , thats very suggestive .
too much would come out .
she can simulate emotion but in reality she is of the same cold , calculating type as her mother .
she drew on long gauntlets of what looked like a kind of fine mesh rather resembling a bulletproof vest i had once been shown .
as she was about to ring it , he arrested her hand .
shall we not all sit down ?
supposing then , that they have never been on the olympia at all ?
fullerton guessed shrewdly , too tight for him .
its distributed in a lot of different ways , nightclubs , pubs , drug stores , an odd doctor or so , fashionable womens dressmakers and hairdressers .
john ambulance association .
you know , sir , he said , youll get into trouble one of these days .
the doctor looked up with abstracted eyes , murmured , lovely , lovely , perfunctorily and went on sorting potsherds .
he had touched the right note .
quite unconsciously , of course .
well , dont say i didnt warn you .
i wish youd tell me when you come in , lynn .
and she telephoned to deirdre henderson .
i said slowly : as far as the pale horse is concerned , yes .
she is a woman who can simulate great emotional stress .
as we seem to be going to spend almost the whole of our time in the kitchen , we ought to have a wireless there , too .
oliver , when i was in malaya , you were with a service family then , werent you ?
asked robin tenderly .
you can have breakfast in bed , stay in bed all day if you like .
strangely enough , it didnt .
he must be a madman .
theodore gerard ?
poirot made an eloquent grimace as he drew a suspicious finger along the top of a book case .
and this confusionthis chaos , continued narracott , these drawers pulled out and their contents scattered .
i shall ask mr .
he looked towards craddock .
it is nigel chapman .
is it true that she was a foreigner ?
dont harbour the idea that i like murder cases !
i am suggesting that , having ascertained just what miss pierce (the only witness likely to be awake) was doing , lady westholme returned to her tent , put on her riding breeches , boots and khaki-coloured coat , made herself an arab head-dress with her checked duster and a skein of knitting-wool and that , thus attired , she went boldly up to dr gerards tent , looked in his medicine chest , selected a suitable drug , took the hypodermic , filled it and went boldly up to her victim .
not to butt in , nothing like that .
apparently it did .
and you , mademoiselle , were in the garden .
all sorts of people come here now who could never have afforded it before .
satterthwaite , frowning .
nor a coat .
charles will see to it .
we were so sorry about that .
she is a very ill woman , and her brain is somewhat muddled with the drugs they give her .
knew something or was concealing somethingwhich ?
there isnt really much to tell .
and so the case fell to pieces ?
we just came here because its a nice house to live in .
she conjured up a vision of hercule poirot .
the others stared at him .
with a good deal of amusement she watched his perusal of it , the drawing together of the bushy eyebrows , the snorts and grunts of violent disapproval .
his unusual obtuseness annoyed me .
i know who walked where , and who they met , and sometimes what they said .
yes , souffle en surprise .
in it , i gave full instructions to my cousin , maurice carfax .
i threw away an old hypodermic .
twenty minutes walk if you want to get there on a visiting dayor threepence on the bus .
and i understand that he came into a good deal of money on her death .
the telephone rangpoirot rose and answered it .
you mean he wasnt at the conference at all ?
i wonder what jane marple will say .
nofret staring out at the nile .
she was so lovely and so sillyand i suddenly feltwell , i felt it would be fun to be a gay dog again and have a flirtation now and then .
id like my tea .
they were just finishing their lunch .
timothy , shall we go to an hotel until the house painting is finished ?
i really hadnt thought i began .
but its the kind of thing one has to go through with , i suppose .
im going up to sittaford this afternoon .
you know what these wops are like !
im afraid hollywood makes onewell , rather arrogant .
there was also a little spirit lamp and a type of morphia hypodermic needle .
was ?
satterthwaite fixed his eyes on mr .
diligent inquiries at the railway station and elsewhere had elicited the following facts .
amyas must have committed suicidehowever unlikely it seems .
the young man went on rapidly : mr .
absolutely wonderful .
miss lambert , at the secondary school , says thats as it should be .
agonies of hope and despair , boredom , idle amusement , life and death .
thats their pigeon , he said consolingly .
yes , with your talk of crime this morning .
both miss vansittart and miss chadwick appeared on this occasion .
wed better have him in .
to you , i must seemshe hesitated a momentmad .
or had she acted in that blindnessthat darkness of the spiritwhen reason is entirely laid aside ?
for gods sake , tell me .
youve got a grudge against that girl , poirot .
, and i felt at once that we were going to be soul-mates .
dontdont , i said fiercely .
youre a qualified man , arent you ?
certainly , sir , said george .
welliercouldnt say as to the exact time .
gulbrandsen and mr .
well , we wont say much about that , m .
another dreadful thing !
he was dressing it and treating it , but it didnt get well .
the difference , of course , went into his pocket .
wait for instructions .
i can assure you that both timothy and i much appreciate it .
the other idea was that there had been a tutor who came to give lessons to the son who had been ill and away from his prep school for six months or soa good-looking young man .
but i want you to have a nice present .
it struck him that what was really odd was that he had so few thoughts about her !
brought on a tray with four sweet biscuits on a little plate .
to begin with its in a special inner pocket .
he shifted his bulk a little in the chair .
just a momenti must go up and see robert first .
for a moment or two she remained lost in thought .
but its something that doesnt fit in where it should .
poirot , his eyes wide with interest , got up and followed her .
packets of things ones never even heard of , exclaimed miss hartnell .
by the pricking of my thumbs postern of fate credits cover illustration and design by sara wood copyright this book is a work of fiction .
upward , her presence has no more significance than that of miss henderson .
she was capable of rudenessin fact she had an insolent rudeness , when she wanted to , that was unbelievable but if she wished to charm you she would succeed every time .
as i see it , this invalid gentleman gets all worked up about ruby keene being such a sweet , innocent , childish little piece of goods .
dear , dear , now , so it is !
julia !
i got all sort of mixed up .
i think at first she hoped that hed give up this other woman and come back .
said miss carnaby to herself reverently .
i should like to , said dermot craddock .
i saw at once how it was .
he wasnt a sentimental man , nor a romantic one .
three months before he had read every detail of the astonishing disappearance of captain richard harwell .
this was usually corrected by rosalind , who would say : but you are an author , mother .
he looked again at that pacing figure .
no discarded ball , no old perambulator , no little chair or a table .
inch , said miss marple , get inch .
so i toddled along here right away .
fortescue , it was among your fathers papers in yewtree lodge .
hes got a black eye .
this was very simple and can easily be understood by a reference to the plan .
its decidedyes .
yes , but shed never tell us .
consider for one little moment , hastings .
theyll do for me yet .
peter lord said quietly : thats all arranged .
indecision was written on every feature of the young mans face .
so those are what you call factseh ?
he talked volubly and at great length .
she rose from her knees .
at intervals , tuppence made other suggestions .
he has something up his sleeve , and i dont know what it is .
i shall never feel the same about it .
she stared at ursula as though she had never seen her before .
heres edward coming out to meet us .
but i wasnt going to have a nephew till october !
i couldnt help wondering if perhaps , after all , she had been going to meet mr .
and what exactly did you tell joyce ?
i want to know the truth , poirot .
of course i knew at once that you had made up your mind to marry him , said my brother-in-law .
lord mayfield laughed .
i still dont understand why , if hes mr .
he answered quickly and reassuringly .
you can bet whether mrs .
and it was true , sir .
ah , but it was a clever idea !
slipped up , said miss marple , nodding her head with satisfaction .
with a little shock renisenb suddenly realized how little they all knew about nofret .
and youre back again .
presently poirot was again jammed tightly on an escalator being carried upwards towards the surface of the earth .
you did not see her mistress , i suppose ?
owen griffith called in his car just before lunchtime , and the gardener was waiting for him with the necessary garden produce .
why , i really believe , midge , he said , amused , that lucy would feel she could get away with murder !
' ' precisely , precisely .
very soon , something will snap .
oh well , wonderful what country air and no late hours or excitements will do for a man if he can only stick it .
a queer look on his face .
i dont mind admitting that for once youve scored handsomely .
nobody noticed her much as she trudged along .
' we ' re hot smffi .
if youve heard the main facts of the case from sir william , ill just tell you what happened this morning , said luke .
she leaned on a stick and raymond supported her on the other side .
he had sent no word to his superiors , even through the indirect channels where he could have done so .
the two other men in the room looked first at grosjean and then at the agitated italian .
bantry said indulgently : i suppose they were film people .
plain dishonest , in fact ?
all you people must be very slack to allow her to be taken out of this country .
from henet ?
she would put no one in her husbands place , she said , and she would be buried with him in his grave in jersey when her time came .
i dont think i particularly want to drink bay rum myself .
you had worked with her and talked with her and sometimes had meals with her , and once went for a walk on the downs .
whereerwhere did i think i had seen you ?
yes , indeed , a man in your position has heavy living expenses .
there wasnt anything there in the nature of jewellery .
luke gave two specimen signatures and was given a cheque-book .
one needed something above ability .
aha , said jimmy .
redferns keen on sailing , too .
damn your consequences .
the nurses tone held distinct acrimony .
it would be as well , she observed drily to poirot , if i stopped now .
miss marple said : what did you do with the hearthrug ?
brown shall i see him ?
one savours its period atmosphere , its studied and deliberate melodrama .
however well mr .
not beautiful enough , she said in a soft dangerous voice .
nostradamus and all that .
so she slips out and gives you a nice little tap on the head to put paid to your curiosity for a while .
it might not have worked , of course .
i had slept well enough that first night , but the next night my sleep was troubled and broken .
she was usually fairly even-tempered .
i had not heard .
carol looked rather pale .
door was locked on the inside .
nobody standing about ?
i think there might be something very painful to learn and i am asking you whether you will be wise enough to say : the past is the past .
you said , mr .
dyou mean the fellow just choked andand died ?
well , i give in .
tuppence sat down at the telephone and was presently connected to the cleveland hotel .
that is why they all lie equally under suspicion .
i tried the middle window and found it unlatched .
almost anything , he thoughtand was shocked with himself for thinking it .
the atmosphere of a bygone day , a day of leisure , of refinement , of ladies and gentlemen closed round me .
what had he learned ?
then he came slowly back .
miss marple has done that more than once , said colonel melchett dryly .
dont want to run any risks .
for me , it is simple .
i said it came from the dining room , and susan said it came from the direction of the drawing room , and miss lingard said it sounded like upstairs , and snell said it came from the road outside , only it came through the upstairs windows .
of course unquestionably it would be better to telephone .
the wide open spaces .
its simply a question of an intelligence test and of your type-group personality .
well , it doesnt matter to me .
lawrence never even attempts to make love to mei cant think why .
poirot switched on the lightwhich was masked by a big alabaster bowl hanging from the ceiling .
do you tell fortunes ?
though i was fond of her , i was not going to have her dictate my life .
joanna took out her mirror and looked at her face long and earnestly .
van aldin nodded briefly .
i recalled the startled face of the girl who had stood in the doorway .
all right , lets do that .
ive got to go by the facts .
someone whose wife was an rc perhaps .
watch her .
lestrange is the lady ive got my eye on .
good morning , said poirot politely .
but if you could help me , hastingsyou and mademoiselle between you , if she will be so very kind .
so you see i was familiar with mr .
well , i dont know , sir , i expect she would lock it up in that purple case of hers .
and thats why she absolutely had to shoot the other woman .
yes , jeremy recalled .
should he knock ?
this is not the first murder that lies to the marquiss charge .
you never know what you can believe here .
oh , but you are madmad !
i dont expect to be thanked for doing my duty , i just do it .
yes , madam , i did , she said .
he thought so .
you see , as soon as i had given the tip about the rows and where the jewel really was , he was keen to pass on the news to his accomplice , and at the same time to keep us all in that room .
blake , that last weekend you had a visitoraerfair-haired young lady .
she pretended enormous interest in our discovery , and we told her all about it and even showed her the diamonds .
i signalled for another cup of coffee and looked around me .
poirot looked discreet .
they went into the small room at the back of the hall which was dignified by that name .
its just a few more questions id like to ask .
ive come here openly .
you ought to by now .
but in that casewe have to find out why .
i wouldnt have interrupted youonly that i thought it might perhaps have something to do with all this .
anything to tell us , doctor ?
oo-ee !
thats what weve got to concentrate upon .
she had been the one who had taken the flat originally , and shared it first with a friend , a girl she already knew , and then with another girl , the third girl .
it really is all wrong .
come , renisenb , i fulfilled all the conventions .
she pulled out a suitcase from under the bed and said : well , here you are , and youll excuse me stopping , but ive got the stew to see to .
lawyers ?
that damned pig-headed scot !
thats right , said tuppence , i remember .
he wished he knew a little more about ex-captain haymes .
are you certain that there is nothing which might link the four together ?
and they may remember someone who does not want to be remembered .
it was a lonely house , two miles from a village , two miles , as molly put it , from anywhere .
it is fortunate that the girl has money .
sir bartholomew had never spoken of her save in medical terms .
you want to help .
in her life up to that particular day , she had never had anything to fear .
i see now that everything will have to be gone intocarefully .
it hadnt got a name , hugo replied .
you meanyoure not going to stay at the embassy ?
harold was smoking a pipe and feeling that the world was a pretty good place .
what again !
oh , i should think about ten or twelve .
but wont your husband mind my butting in like this ?
that was about ten minutes or so before you heard the cry ?
they go their own way .
hogben had clearly said all he had to say and rung off .
hes the same swine dying as he was when he was in the pink of condition !
i mean , there are other dogs .
i was to learn much from alan everard himself .
but it is not my idea of ethical conduct .
i said , anxious like .
or discovery , or whatever you call these things ?
of course , if youve made up your mind about it , youll find an answer to everything .
captain trevelyan wouldnt have been an easy person to get to know otherwise .
so cold , so far away .
my friends and i had been let in rather badly over it .
you have been of a marvellous promptness , he observed .
it was he who switched on a reading lamp which resulted in a fuse going , thereby giving him the opportunity to leave the hall and go to the fuse box .
clarissa was still smiling complacently .
as to the man they caught in the grounds , i understand that his defence has consisted all along of a persistent denial .
what about the woman ?
always jewels .
yes , yes , but this is a bit more than that .
i must make a little confession to you , said poirot .
when she saw what she had done she gave her mother fifty-one .
with murder at the vicarage , a _num_ dramatization by moie charles and barbara toy of a _num_ novel of the same title , agatha christies other popular investigator , miss marple , made her stage debut .
and so on , and so on .
you see the sheet is torn ?
i had hoped you might be able to assist me .
you look after people when they arrivesize them up , of coursesome like to be left alone and others are lonely and want to get into the swing of things .
inquest is the day after tomorrow you said ?
were the foreigners aware that the sealed packet was in his possession ?
oliver shook her head .
i drank obediently .
i suppose you have considered the possibility that miss arundells death may turn out to be from natural causes ?
polonska , according to her own story , had suffered great bereavement in her own country , and that might have turned her brain .
the sunday accounts finished , and commissions written down for the coming week , the uncles would arrive .
fact one : on sunday evening nurse leatheran finds miss johnson in tears , and that same evening miss johnson burns a fragment of a letter which nurse believes to be in the same handwriting as that of the anonymous letters .
the merry shamrockbut it doesnt look very merry .
do you know , michael is delighted .
i remember pushing it aside to get an old pipe .
yes , i had the evidence of mademoiselle robson , of jim fanthorp , and of jacqueline de bellefort as to the first , and i had the skilled testimony of dr .
she really went to charlock yesterday ?
terrible that is , in all of these places , and more especially if its onion or cabbage thats on the fire .
it was based on a kind of emotional reaction or susceptibility towell , i can only call it atmosphere .
i feel im just definitely the most suspicious character on the train .
x at half past eleven , charles laverton-west was ushered into chief inspector japps room .
his modesty , i suppose .
theyre chosen for me , she said rather bitterly .
then , supposing we forget crime and go to a show ?
that is the husband of peggy legge is he an atomic scientist ?
no , no , of course not , he admitted .
better have them in now , said superintendent battle .
he went off to do art or some tomfoolery of that kind .
oh , dont speak of her to medont speak of her .
bob was in the hall .
he may be able to throw some light on the mystery .
i am not an authority on darning , but it did occur to me that the strange puckered blot of violently contrasting wool was perhaps not quite a success .
you see , we received a letter he broke off as sir henry clithering entered the room .
ill just slip on my goloshesand now where did i put my cardigan ?
kennedy stopped and reeled back as a jet of soapy water struck him between the eyes .
have you got a handkerchief ?
and he said , oh , tuesday about tea time .
i asked him questions then .
he knew a lot about this place , you know , went on henry .
raymond stood as though turned to stone .
fair to me ?
he went off and returned shortly with the once rusty but now more or less oiled key .
as she did so , she felt a soft touch on her arm .
you do not think it odd , asked poirot , that these strangers should come unprovided with a weapon , with gloves , with a spade , and that they should so conveniently find all these things ?
i hope so .
as in this case the time of death was accepted without question .
in the first the questions would be : but who is she , dear ?
shes the kindwell , you couldnt imagine her doing anything like thatanything violent , if you know what i mean .
you are quite right , my dear .
but the other man didnt give up .
go , henet , and i warn yoube careful of your words and actions .
that is not what we are discussing .
a few years ago roberts must have been guilty of indiscretion , at least , with one of his lady patients .
nasty .
where were you at eight minutes past eight this evening ?
fortunately , owing to the kindness of an unknown benefactory we were able to make a slightly higher offer .
you see , my dear madam , im afraid they will be prepared for that move on your part .
she flashed out : i dont know what you mean !
went in for the lusts of the flesh and enjoyed them .
she wore blackvery expensive black and a good deal of it .
bridget said , watching him : you meant to get married and settle down when you came home , didnt you ?
a most interesting man , he said , and asked how much work there had been for father lavigny to do so far .
to go down with guy pagett was the last thing i wanted !
theyd known each other quite well in the states .
sitting at the desk ?
schedule a ?
it led into a pleasant sitting room .
sarah answered mechanically questions that were addressed to her .
twenty-six i receive a letter my friend , you will know all when you get this .
ive fished and bathed and taken long walks and sunbathed i noticed that you had sunbathed , yes , said poirot politely .
the crime took place at least two hours earlier .
besides , major despard enjoys a dangerous life .
coleman might have entered and the servants minds would have no remembrance of such an event .
nothing , i am sure , is going on .
one always did have to make up gerdas mind for her .
but i was never the bright boy of the family .
parker pyne turned to confront an italian general who had been on the same boat with him from brindisi to beirut .
do tell me your problem .
nice english name .
blenkensop , or have you just come in ?
montgomery jones .
you said you thought miranda was like a wood nymph , she said .
there was a rather unpleasant business .
she turned hesitatingly to the man behind her .
but there was a most unfortunate accident .
a mashie shot or two would steady my nerves , i think , said bundle .
a bathroom , a linen cupboard , a double bedded spare room , an occupied single bedroom , a womans room with a double bed (mary restaricks ?
said miss hinchcliffe coarsely .
blore said : godthe revolver !
that woman had to diehere !
but well be able to identify it , of course , by the engine number .
got any enemies here that you know of , mr .
i think youll get more out of her than i shall .
and goodness knows what i was promising the women in the end .
at a registry office or something .
here is something a hundred times more interesting than pearls .
do come in , she said .
hwah !
anthony marston was standing beside blore looking over his shoulder .
it would be more to the point to have put through the first call from his house , i objected .
rathbone sighed .
the area of search was limited , and we were continually in sight of each other .
i dont really know that i do .
i have had a consultation with mr .
if not , i will call for you here in an hours time .
they do not think so , but i cook it and not tell them .
however , she doesnt seem to have had anything to do with it , and as a matter of fact she behaved very well , swam out to the rescue and was actually carried out to sea and only just rescued in time .
he was whining pitifully and his position showed her that he was badly hurt .
philip , he shook an admonitory finger at herno wild surmises .
if it is not all clear to you , you will then hand it over to your legal adviser .
you are quite right , m .
tina got up from her chair with a lazy , graceful movement not unlike that of the kitten to which micky had just compared her .
they have left africa , it is certain .
as you say , i am a woman who can keep her secrets well .
and what a useful thing it is to have that reputation !
presently the ambulance left and we knew that nannies body had been taken away in preparation for an autopsy .
i had a motive .
there was really no arguing with him if he chose to take that line .
she said if id get hold of five hundred pounds shed let you go on thinking so .
the window there had undeniably been forced , yet nothing seemed to have been taken .
leaving the doctor in charge , he had hurried down to the inn .
janet groom , shes gone home to her niece and the police have got the key .
i hope youll excuse my coming in like this , m .
he looked at his little notebook .
a crime with no complications .
caux , is very notorious .
it still bore its original jacket , a gaily coloured affair representing a lady , with smartly shingled hair and scarlet fingernails , sitting on a tiger skin , in the traditional costume of eve .
she falls into his arms , and the curtain comes down .
baker the other .
and even that hadnt lasted longer than a week !
but his headquarters are up near the museum .
graphically , with many gestures , he set forth the story as mr .
youll see , said sybil .
and you cant give me anything nearer than that , mr .
she is dead , poirot declared .
(did they have manslaughter in these foreign countries ?
bantry asked : was ruby keene very pretty ?
he glanced up at the framed nursery rhyme over the mantelpiece .
then , almost as an afterthought , she concentrated on the actual script .
oh i shouldnt say so particularly .
he uttered a pained ejaculation and turned upon his daughter .
she sat back and pushed a mop of hair out of her eyes , looking up expectantly at craddock .
do you understand me ?
madame daubreuil accompanied us down the stairs .
savages relatives were prepared to spend a lot of money on fighting the casewhich i gather they were not prepared , or indeed in a position , to do .
but last night the dream came again .
she looked ratherfunny .
masking it as far as was possible to one of her ingenuous disposition she sat down by valentine chantry and inquired : have you had a nice morning ?
there were no lights on , and that struck her as rather ungracious on the hostesss part .
really , i do think people have gone a little crazy about breeding dachshunds .
you must look after the family when ive gone .
once more a murder is announcedfor the benefit and enjoyment of miss marple .
thats right , he agreed .
i will , said james between his teeth .
time and again there had been a moment when hed held his breath and said , if this goes wrong .
valuable , said luke .
jacko could plan a thing and be sure he would not suffer from the consequences .
now let us talk this affair over , said m .
but the babbingtons really were christians ; they didnt poke and pry and condemn , and they were never unkind about people or things .
victorian to the core .
you werent at the party .
first i suspect , then i look for reasons .
want facts ?
blenkensops bedroom and remaining there for a quarter of an hour save one .
derekwhat could he know ?
heather badcock meant no harm .
and admiral cronshaw wrote : very good chapabsolutely sound .
we are fellow passengers , are we not ?
he might be weakor wild .
and by accepting any deaths that occurred as quite natural , it would influence a doctor to think they were quite all right .
it is terrible what you say there , monsieur .
they breakfasted and drove to le bourget .
he was indeed lost , without honour or renown , a pathetic little figure very far from home .
i will pay all your expenses .
giraud became inscrutable .
my friend is , of course , not known to you , he said .
theres hardly any mystery about it .
but as ive said before , in my opinion , shes very much all there .
from the dining room on my left there came the rattle of teacups and the short , dry cough of my sister caroline .
did you talk to him at all ?
second , i havent got a housekeepera couple of giggling girls run my house .
) ' ' no .
a public thoroughfare was always to her an observation post .
directed by him , the jury brought in the inevitable verdict .
dont suppose youll be troubled by seeing much of me .
when its a double suicide , one thinks of it as one death .
i think ive caught glimpses of her , said ellie .
yes , it is , replied richard , but the key to it is on my fathers bunch of keys which i have here .
that woman like a wilted cabbage , whats her namewills .
i dont think we can do anything more tonight .
and you took her to the pictures or a meal ?
gwenda , said giles .
just cora up to her tricks , that was all .
' japp asked .
and then emily brewsters foreboding took definite shape .
can we ?
in fact , you were all one big happy family ?
this title was previously published as there is a tide agatha christie poirot taken at the flood .
her eyes opened reproachfully at taverner .
copleigh indulgently .
did you read the book on the pyramid prophecies i sent you ?
i wont take a penny from you .
was one of the most comforting things she had ever heard .
flora ackroyd _num_ .
archie had the work he enjoyed , with an employer who was his friend ; he liked the people he worked with ; he had what he had always wanted , to belong to a first-class golf club , and to play every weekend .
widburn was dispensing honied words and limp handshakes .
weihavent got any tickets for alassio .
its almost a relief .
prince michaels servant , eh ?
theres that mention of a letter from a lady that tommy saw .
small though the actual quantity is , it comprises a large amount of the worlds stock and represents a value of millions of francs .
folliat , said m .
james behaved impeccably .
the agony column .
without much success , i reminded her .
he set his shoulders to it and heaved .
oh , yes , said stillingfleet , cheerfully still .
but the main lines were clear and had been closely tested .
you heard about mrs .
the blue cards , dont you think , partner ?
poirot suddenly assumed his lecturing manner , and addressed us collectively .
you must be doing this sort of thing all the time .
it was the usual cupboard .
thats rather a question , said suzanne .
it beats me , i said at last , what you expect to get out of that .
im sure were in a real den of iniquity , said tuppence with a pleased face .
three men stood in the doorway .
but there are two tragedies where the law gives no relief .
the car was left outside a farmhouse in a rather lonely spot .
i didnt think of it .
mon ami , that is your part , said poirot gently .
poirot murmured : if you will now tell me the facts of the case .
you will spell that ?
we were bound for bolzano and the italian tyrol .
but i do go up in arms against the silly old-fashioned prejudice that womens place is always the home .
weve both changed .
he also missed a concentrated solution of digitalisor something of that kind .
there is no better camouflage for dubious business than an atmosphere of the highest respectability .
butt or mrs .
im afraid that will be a disappointment to you .
and we all laughed a good deal .
it starts on monday , doesnt it ?
in a court of law , for instancethe whole thing would be ridiculed !
poirot retrieved it and in her agitation aunt kathie let a second bag slip , whereupon a tin of golden syrup began a gay career rolling along the high street .
the race is to the swiftestand often to the most unscrupulous !
the young have such innocent minds .
try and vary your methods as you will , your tastes , your habits , your attitude of mind , and your soul is revealed by your actions .
clayton shaking hands .
rowley scowled angrily .
mcgillicuddy was unable to relax .
i thought you might have seen about it .
very pleased .
she was shut up with him for an hour or more , and when he left she was obliged to go to bed , so white and shaken was she by the interview .
his eyes went from the chair to the closed door .
allen was in any financial difficulties ?
he would then reach for his tape measure , which was always at hand .
no , the man on board in the cabin next door does his work , pretends to force the lock in an obvious manner so as to draw immediate attention to the theft , really unlocks the trunk with a duplicate key , throws the package overboard and waits until the last to leave the boat .
poirot lowered his voice .
i shouldnt have thought it was your taste but oh , it isnt , i said .
that she got embroiled with some young man much younger than herself .
but he was so very nice , and so apologetic for having mistaken anyone else for me , that i feel sure he must have been telling the truth .
and it had better be you , henet , since youre so willing to die for any member of the family .
i understand perfectly , said miss bulstrode .
if i swear to you on my honour that justice and only justice has been done , will you not abandon this inquiry ?
no newspapers .
he put his hand on her arm for a minute .
leidner !
i waited breathlessly for an answer .
but theyll track you down .
i turned back puzzled and found her eyes fixed on mine with the strangest expression in them .
menace had materialized in the shape of inspector morton and superintendent parwell .
i am a medical man .
that letter was meant for my eyes alone .
miss leatheran breathed into that one word a whole gamut of pleasurable emotion .
i cant recall anyone of that name .
i remember thornley colton , the blind detectiveaustin freeman , of course ; freeman wills croft with his wonderful timetables ; and inevitably sherlock holmes .
i always mix up those two wordsand actually thinks herself that she has stolen the money .
well , well , she said , let us get to business .
chapter _num_ the thumb mark of st peter and now , aunt jane , it is up to you , said raymond west .
he turned a corner and two dimly-seen figures sprang apart .
yeseryes , said lord caterham as a matter of fact , i hoped , i mean , that i shall be delightedhis conscience drove him ononly too delighted if you will stay on for a little .
i only rescued our dear giraffe just in time .
in turn , american tourists , german tourists , middle-class english families , questionable ladies , impoverished russian aristocrats and weary discreet waiters all flitted across the scene .
it was an intimate dinner , herself and her father , john segrave , and a girlfriend who was staying with her .
shes asleep , isnt she ?
we cannot now call upon m .
i havent done anything about him yet .
now she dominates us all !
itll be a worm in a minute and i hate worms .
it might seem quite a natural thing to do on ellies having attained her majority and having had her marriage helped on by gretas good officessettle a sum of money upon her in a fit of gratitude .
who found himmiss pebmarsh ?
bobs ball was in the corner of it .
cars collided in the fog , i expect .
murder it is , said the inspector , with great satisfaction .
how sinister the country was , somehow .
its only a matter of time .
she didnt see father again until apparently a few months ago .
its so cold .
divorced him as quietly as possible .
iv pilar marched into the drawing room , her head held high .
lady coote has hysterics and faints in bills armsbill being the weight carrier .
yes , and he trades on that !
the other planwill not fail .
but then we thought of the sleepwalking story .
id borrowed it .
his aunts face was not encouraging .
once i felt that i was on the spot , i no longer suffered from the awful pangs of anxiety .
thats the kind of thing men always say to their wives , said mrs .
the eye he could see with was his right eye .
and habit dies hard .
i could find out , i suppose , said dermot craddock slowly .
that is what i will do to him , she cried , and that !
he went over in his mind all that had appeared in the papers about soldier island .
we appeared to be the only lunchers .
hes the sort of man who is willing to be proud of another familys ghost , and who isnt going to run the risk of having it driven away when hes paid spot cash for it .
their financial standing will have to be investigated , of course .
but of course , pilar continued regretfully , he could never have been so big as you .
black thursday , you know .
argentine beauties are notoriously jealous .
what can i do for you , inspector ?
olivers eyes sparkled with excitement .
i shall have a bathe right away .
he said simply : youre crazy .
kirkwood , what can you possibly expect to find at hazelmoor ?
there was still half an hour to go .
and this is always your home , remember .
she went out of the room to answer it .
if possible , dont even let her know i was staying in the same hotel .
theres a war on !
rafiel to go about things , especially when he was a successful business and financial operator .
can i trust you , julia ?
i should have seen him .
i have been told , by a man who is really great , one of the greatest scientists and brains of the day , that you area sound man .
im not coming .
protheroe said she was calling for her husband at the vicarage so that they could go home together .
oh , i wouldnt put it quite as seriously as that , said tommy , in his most noncommittal manner .
came here a month ago , they did .
then , as he struck , she may have uttered a half crytoo late .
ive fancied that shed gone too far for oncethat she was not only biter but bit !
i am so dreadfully fond of him , wailed emily .
i said , starkwedder replied , that i dont think mrs warwick feels like any more questions just at the moment .
because , he wagged a finger impressively , if you get across her , your cows will stop giving milk , your potato crop will fail , or little johnnie will twist his ankle .
if george had been in danger of criminal prosecution mr .
hes as much out of it as mr .
and the final coincidence which put the clue into my hand was strange also .
your lack of imagination is going to make you absolutely a sitting target .
poirot swept on , not waiting for a comment .
approaching them from the house was a figure that , seen side by side with miss greenshaw , seemed ludicrously dissimilar .
or anxious ?
but that i will not weary you with at this moment .
she was wiping her face with a handkerchief .
satipy has always had the courage of a lion .
i believe ive heard of it , sir , said inspector campbell .
he proceeded to rummage among his papers .
it seems to be all bubbles , said mr lazenby vaguely .
and , of course , it isnt what you might call nice for a young girl to be staying alone at a place like the blue boar , reporters about and all .
my men have searched that sixty-five acres and theres no trace anywhere of disturbed earth , and i should say that by now weve rooted under every bush there is .
oh , it was just that nobody seemed to know much about him .
i get a fourth share .
theres no heating in this room .
i say , thats pretty rich .
young people , i feel , should see plenty of people and placesespecially people .
you remembermademoiselle ?
you know , the very thought of that inquest makes me so nervous , i dont know what to do .
strange , that feeling of content , of peace , of clear singing happiness .
you know the person who killed louise bourget , you say .
' ' you are not bound to answer the question , of course .
your master sent for me when this tragedy occurred .
wait a bit .
pure balderdash .
dont do it , dear , protested lady mannering .
as i explained to rosaleen , we had always depended on gordon .
tommy said finally : definitely not .
of course , i suppose children were so unimportant that they only let them have the legs .
sheila said : im glad youve come .
she was just very stupid , said mrs bantry .
abdul says she is illcannot move .
she , too , must be removed .
what im really surprised at is that the old man didnt marry again before .
coincidences , said hercule poirot , do happen .
he cant refuse to tell us .
what about the clock , clement ?
neele went over to it and picked it up .
suddenly awakened from sleep , she had discerned two masked men bending over her .
no no , of course not , he wasnt there .
listen , he said .
he isnt really marrying me for my money if that is what you are getting at .
i knew that .
why dont you go and look at her now and then you can come back and talk about her .
prepare to behold the wonders of antiquity .
they were the voices of robin and mrs .
you cant be ashamed of something that justhappens to you .
when i emerged poirot had descended the staircase and was standing in the hall .
an idea struck him .
sixteen the birds fly south was that the car ?
henrietta said quietly : i have told you that i am not very truthfulbut when john said : henrietta he was not accusing me of having murdered him .
she said : it was all very upsetting .
youre the victims niece , the boy repeated with relish .
they suspect him , you know , of being in withwhat shall i call it ?
the house party hesitated in the doorway .
the comte went up to his bedroom and crossed over to an old bureau that stood against the wall .
he was a big florid man , dressed in tweeds with a hearty manner and a jovial effusiveness .
he had interviewed mr norton kane , and told poirot in confidence that the young mans manner had not impressed him favourably .
she likes to have control of other human beings and she likes to make them suffer .
caroline resented meand quite rightly .
an affectionate creature , but an absolute fool .

well , i was damned lucky once , said tommy .
where are you going to ?
theres nothing in it to trouble scotland yard aboutim not a penny the worse in any way , and its probably all due to a simple mistake .
vera cried : dont you see ?
a very curious characternot , i should say , a very nice character .
ive made a mistake , said old master , had to tear the whole thing up .
she smiled engagingly .
meynell had said .
yes , i think i did read it , you know .
in detective stories there was always an obliging scrap of paper .
george took hold of his masters finger .
she was watching the boynton familyor rather she was watching one particular member of it .
bishop bowed her head .
i loved it so much .
modesty forbade miss marple to reply that she was , by now , quite at home with murder .
i cant butt in like that .
what about the companion ?
i must have made some murmur of dissent , for she went on quickly : oh , yes , he did !
a terrifying mountain of a woman with beady eyes and a moustache gave him a beaming smile .
she had been painstaking but never competent at anything she undertook .
it isnt natural .
she brought documents to prove her identity ?
you dont get the tone unless youve got the volume .
shed take the car , and start early tomorrow morning .
im very sorry , sir , very sorry indeed that it has been necessary to do so .
colonel carbury drummed on the table with his fingers .
i had seldom known poirot clumsy , and i could deduce from it that he was in a great state of mental perturbation .
you cant frighten them , or persuade them , or diddle them .
spence , now , she says he was distrait all the evening .
her voice died away in a gurgle .
miss waynflete was continuing , a note of gentle admiration in her voice .
but there , i mustnt keep you gossiping .
his wife was brokenhearted .
it must have been about then .
did you load the pistol ?
she had had a faint hope , perhaps , that he would argue with her , that he would try to persuade her , but he seemed , quite simply , to feel just as she did about it .
for the best buders do not knock at doo yet indubitably this was a fu ' st-class butler !
someone hurried out from behind the wings , and spoke to lord rustonbury .
something interesting was happening or going to happen .
what would you ?
we didnt have sexy books .
there was a faint sound from violet willett .
they were elicited subsequently at the trial by a process of long and tedious cross-examinations .
he looked inquiringly at her .
and she did write from abroad .
meaning the policeand others , said kelvin significantly .
balderson and hodgkins , and he regretfully declined the kind invitation of lord caterham as he was leaving england almost immediately .
on the following day he remarked , looking up at the sky , that is a messerschmitt coming over now .
leidner had , deep down , a dislike of entering into the marriage bond , it is possible that she took this way of extricating herself from difficult positions .
produce a later will made on old emilys deathbed .
the way they are said .
that is not a normal feature of meadowbank , said miss bulstrode , dryly .
we werent she smiled suddenly at poirot .
inquiry at the office revealed the fact that tuppence had not yet returned .
a couple of bathers were coming up it .
your judgement is not upto-date , naturally , having lived in the argentine so long .
it was not until after everyone had gone that i discovered the safe rifled !
outside the window the sun was coming up .
sir ronald barked .
he arrived very white , very tense .
nothing can happen to me .
not locked .
alcohol , poirot thought , certainly loosens the tongue .
henet half-turned her head .
the doctor strode to the table where the drinks were .
poirot said : i mean that this is not a crime that was committed single-handed .
the false hattie would have lived out her life as the real hattie though doubtless her mental powers would have unexpectedly improved owing to what would vaguely be called new treatment .
but nicholson seems to have appeared on the scene very suddenly .
thats why i saysomethings up !
no , i will admit that .
you know miss marple perfectly well .
thats the lot , i think .
you thought that it was she who would nothow shall i say itrest easy in her grave ?
wasnt that it ?
sarahs thoughts ran along a familiar psychological track .
yes , i remember reading about it , said father .
reilly went on .
carrie louise sighed .
you mean this unknown woman that weve more or less postulated without even knowing theres any such person ?
thats why i want to keep you away from london .
was i any the wiser for what i had learned from them all ?
then he had said he was going out for a stroll before going to bed .
ill allow you natural causes in his case .
tell me , what happened out there ?
looked as though he might be keen on janet rustington .
he went back over the accounts of the inquest and the various things in the house .
so good had the performance been that he was left with the impression that so and only so could ellis have acted .
demanded theresa fiercely .
because , if it wasnt stephen farraday , it must be anthony browne .
so , at any rate , i saved a mans life .
but behind that vindictive anger was something cold and shrewd , something that appraised chances , a cool , calculating intelligence .
put yourself in georges place .
she suggested hopefully , remembering that nuts were nutritious .
a schoolteacher , he said , and there might be a bit of a stink about it .
i guess youd better keep this , nurse .
youre very unexpected , len .
i dont know what its all about .
they didnt speakonly the young lady got up and wandered away .
why didnt you say ?
poirot here , whose name im very familiar with (and proud we are to have him with us , im sure) , tells me that to the best of his belief you were shot at in the grounds of the majestic hotel the other morning ?
iv on her way back from the station , miss hinchcliffe stopped the car to pick up miss marple who was hurrying along the street .
its manslaughter .
i will now converse with the other witnesses .
and if youre wise you wont do it then .
then he said : i dont knowexactly .
hes a slow-thinking man .
kirsten lindstrom met her at the top of the stairs .
it can do no harm to try .
oneill ?
she had no doubts , no qualmsno pity either .
one has an idea sometimes .
she did not hear the sounds from below , of a chair being overturned , of a door opening , of mens feet running up the stairs .
i wouldnt have any confidence in him .
i thoughti thought it would be all over .
i think i know what you mean , mrs .
it was better , though , in the old days , when there wasnt all this caged-in glass business .
james blunt , the well-known dramatic critic , sir oscar hammerfeldt of the overton film studios , miss jane wilkinson (lady edgware) and others .
seems just like a bad dream !
i dont look at it that way .
i will bring you some fresh tea , sir .
i think she is mad .
monsieur poirot , monsieur poirot .
i suppose you are thinking of mrs .
a few days ago , sir claud received this anonymous letter , he revealed .
seventh month : pleasing appearance and nice manners so striking that am promoted to waiting on the sisters !
was it you rang up ?
you wont smoke , i suppose ?
were other people as wise as you were in that respect ?
do you think he let a confederate in ?
thats why hes been so long about finding a house of his own .
i never felt it , said mrs .
nobody mentioned coras husband much .
he swaggers round and does no work that he can help and pretends that anything that is asked of him is too hard for him !
she thought : their faces tell me nothing .
donaldsons were impervious .
we just want to get a clear picture .
they went round the house till they came to the study window .
she laughed in her usual hearty manner , to indicate that it was a joke , and applied a perfunctory glance to the nearest windowpaneperfunctory because she knew quite well that the front room was seldom used , mr .
then the clerk said : its mr .
it is an impression only yes , but it may be a very valuable one .
it tells menothing .
i shall not allow it .
but i remember him .
i adore actingbut im ham , though i look nice .
as i say , went on elsie , dr .
extremely difficult .
poor hattie has always been poor hattie .
netta edged away .
and they say how much they love my awful detective sven hjerson .
changing the subject he said : by the way , did you get a letter from helen ?
thursdays , sir .
uncle frank , it seemed , had got himself into a jam of some kind .
its all beautifully dovetailed , you know .
they were all there , lady astwell , victor astwell , lily margrave , the secretary , and parsons , the butler .
by the way , you must have been quite near where the murder wasthe a b c murder .
well , it depends how you look at things .
and you had quite a plausible story .
ah well , one goes through these things .
whittington took a cab and gave the name of an hotel .
i am waiting for a final piece of evidence .
i regret infinitely , madame , that i cannot be of service to you .
stephen farraday had a very good eye for faces .
an orthodox english summers day .
its all been very suddenbut i know youll be fond of martineand look after her if anything happens to me .
my opinion was that there was nothing to be donenothing , that is , unless mr .
bouc looked at poirot .
poor mum , she was all broken up .
rymer .
agatha christie deserves her fame .
miss henders , ' had excused herself and gone out on deck .
no , steve darling .
everyone took for granted that the man in madames compartment in paris was the comte de la roche .
i have an idea thatwithout knowing iti said something of significance .
yours affectionately , tuppence .
i will attend most carefully .
youre thinking of young ted gerard , arent you , sir ?
that first day that we came here , inspector japp and i , you were startled to see usalarmed .
and a fig tree that grew just outside the greenhouse .
its just nonsense .
i meant , had you ever been completely down and out over a case through your own fault ?
funny that the s .
and yet you could never envisage chaddy as headmistress of an outstanding school .
i am sure if she had come down from the berth above i would have awakened .
she looked bonier and more acid than ever .
that evening her gaoler reappeared with another tray of food .
ive watched you often and i know just how you do it .
oh , well , of course , in that case the three men left the room together , closing the door behind them .
one had to have help .
not over bright , but harmless .
lorrimer speaking , he said .
i am belgian , not french , but no matter .
bridget said quietly : i had an idea that you came down here in connection with the death of that girl , amy gibbs .
i arrived in london , just after the raids , and max , having met me at paddington , drove me to a flat in half moon street .
the whole things so absurdso fantastic !
and used the rivingtons as a means of getting to this part of the world naturally ?
jeffries , is a charming , innocent , high-minded girl , and the only way she is going to get any kick out of her life with you is to believe that she has reformed a rake .
and a nice steady girl , too , and not stuck-up , as she might have been with all the notice taken of her .
just after half past five now , he said .
perhaps you wouldnt .
i looked up his antecedents too .
i gasped .
i think that grey-haired lady is kind of distinguished-looking , dont you ?
he had encouraged me to make a perfect fool of myself .
how very agreeable of you , inspector , sir rowland replied .
heather was continuing in a determined manner with her story .
it was his wife who got in touch with the russians andno , no , thats something that happened since then .
what had she done with them ?
its getting late .
was the pretty daughter mixed up in it ?
he has lately been hearing news of your convent .
i never can think of anything to say , said jennifer .
i dont know if there were any galbraiths extant .
so fortunate to find you .
protheroe leave old hall for village in car .
no friction of any kind between him and the general .
i know now what you mean about your friend santonix .
he coughed tactfully .
and he had a lot of charm .
you have not received any letter lately from anyone proposing to call upon you ?
ill turn the sitting-room light on .
murrays side .
as sir oswald so often said , to reporters and others : i attribute my success entirely to my habits of early rising , frugal living , and methodical habits .
sattherthwaite had spoken his part .
she ought to sit at home and take care of herself .
there was an incident .
he got up , and so did she .
she felt sure now that it wasnt bassington-ffrench who had pushed pritchard over the cliff .
and suddenly , as had happened last night , a woman looked out of the childs eyes .
he heard himself speaking to her , saying foolish little things meant to be comforting , and ludicrously inadequate to the agony he had divined .
haydock spoke suddenly .
he saw it in the way the colour drained out of her cheeks again .
i thought that her friendship with patrick redfern had made trouble between her and her husband .
the door opened and inspector jameson entered .
everything pointed to death being due to accidental causes but there was not sufficient evidence to show what had caused the accident to occur .
poirot murmured : all cats are grey in the dark !
percy rapidly , but theres no doubt about it , mr .
madame joilet relapsed into indifference .
i noticed it because theres a superstition about that ; they say two spoons in a saucer means a wedding .
until i have had the position explained to me , i can hardly make promises .
dont mind me , said miss bulstrode .
everybody was in a good humour .
but i cant let you in on this .
a pretty young girl she was , so ive always heard .
wall-papers were the most foolproof .
but sordid robbery and assaultthat seems highly incongruous .
bantrys account .
whereabouts has he got to in his dinner ?
the living image of my great aunt sarahs belinda she is , said mrs .
a sad evening .
as you have justly observed , elise , day by day she gets whiter and thinner .
now the other , she is different .
then supposing he came in after us , he slowly closed the doorway behind us and sacrificed us there on the threshold .
to tina ?
she had been very kind to me .
and tuppence had said of courseshe wasnt doing anything particularshed go down to the school and take jane out and give her lunch and then go back to the sports and all the rest of it .
you are a great detective , m .
it will be proved or disproved soon enough .
it was fear that had lent that urgency to her footsteps .
your son will be taken from you at twdve o ' clock noon tomorrow , the twenty-ninth .
he wanted a different opinion .
miss grooms not so young herself and she has the rheumatism cruel bad when the winds in the east .
practically talk a foreign language .
miss greenshaw did not like spending money , and yet she engaged you and agreed quite willingly to the terms you asked .
he said at last : why did you take the pistol , lucy ?
his meticulous naturalism had now gone out of fashion , and since his death , he was little spoken of .
may i come in and speak to you ?
sergeant farrell and p .
he didnt care for the girl , cold-blooded young hussy .
preposterous , he said angrily .
the best answer ever found , she suspects , was transportation : a vast land of emptiness , peopled only with primitive human beings , where man could live in simpler surroundings .
i think she came ini heard the gate squeakyes , some time after half past twelve .
i have perhaps purposely put off mentioning her , because i was from the first a little afraid of her .
it was best so , she said .
edgar keith , whose name figured first in a list of seven reposing in tommys pocketbook .
the criminal brutes who induced my brother to become a slave to that drug murdered him just as truly as if they had struck him down .
you are a celebrated detective , m .
poirot concealed a smile .
demanded reggie carrington .
i work .
but you must be frank , added poirot .
only we didnt see when wed be able to marry .
ul ' s sake , i endeavoured to make terms with him .
miss marple unfolded the fragile paper .
thats what must have happened !
i even believe that he brought some pressure to bear upon the young man .
if you dont object , sir , he hesitated , we could give them a lift .
no more coffee ?
always one must know more !
satterthwaite thought : a thin story .
whats the matter with you , alix ?
the words were unimpeachable , the manner very well done , but an affectionate wife of as many years standing as mrs .
no , he didnt drown .
country squirestay at home sort of chap .
a syrup of black currant , said poirot .
translated from the russianabsolutely the most significent piece of drama for the last twenty years .
how extraordinarily fortunate , said emily .
if you please , mr .
im sure , sir , she said , ill tell you anything i can .
you see , she was passed over , as it were , by the mistress .
elinor said calmly : you are not particularly tied ?
supposing my utmost ambitions were realizedthat i was called to the bar , and rose to the height of my profession ?
its better to know , isnt it ?
ii miss marple had just ensconced herself in her favourite chair by the window when mrs .
one wondersone really does not know , one cant begin to imagine colonel pikeaway listened kindly .
as you say !
but we cannot break through to that subterranean knowledge .
he suggested that he and ewan should come over to maughold house at ten oclock the following morning , when mrs .
renisenb said suddenly : you mended my lion for melong ago , do you remember ?
did youexcuse meapprove of your fathers second marriage .
i knew just what he meant by that .
i think myself (ive no authority for saying this , you understand) that she went up to get the stuff , and that it was then she decided to do what she did do .
youre very late , basil , said his mother .
she admonished .
i came forward , didnt i , when i saw his picture in the paper ?
if only aunt emily were to die we could get married at once , and you could come to london and have a laboratory full of test tubes and guinea pigs , and never bother anymore about children with mumps and old ladies with livers .
thank you so much for all the trouble youve taken .
the police were always moving them on , he said .
hercul blinked a little , realizing .
no exceptions allowed .
no , he is in the telephone box .
would you like to fly , megan ?
poirot handed her his card , and a letter from the insurance company for mrs .
of course i didnt tell him that wed all been discussing nothing else for the last hourever since the poor girl breathed her last .
megan transferred her attention to joanna .
lucifer , son of the morningthe fallen angel .
but there are other claimsthere is , m .
but we must be sensible .
it must be years since i saw you last , said mrs .
she may have thought that it was a form of insidious blackmail , that perhaps he suspected somethingand that later , if there was publicity in the papers as there might be after belle goedlers death , he would realize that in her he had found a gold mine .
its rather a shock for a girl that age .
his back was stiff from sitting in a cramped position and as he stretched himself to his full height an onlooker would have realized that he was , in reality , quite a tall man .
said marie wonderingly .
she made a very full confession of all shed been doing .
were not staying here , you know , said pat .
i wouldnt like to say , said ardwyck fenn .
he went all to pieces when you mentioned that .
in the past tensenot the present .
you seeyou must seethat something had to be done !
he asked , sounding annoyed .
patrick redfern stuck out his chin mutinously .
i can only tell you this , they are both rich and powerful .
if you feel that you could undertake anyinvestigation i suppose is the word you would use .
poirot said , smiling , the good superintendent has asked you your opinion of your companions as candidates for murder .
youve heard what happened next door yesterday .
she was attending a meeting of the womens institute to discuss the raising of a sum for building a small additional couple of rooms .
a title has a kind of glamour still , i suppose , he said .
just as you like , of course , mr .
the exclamation sounded almost triumphant .
husband is employed in the building and decorating tradea painter .
it cant have any bearing on the crime , anyway .
never have i seen such a yawn !
weve got m-a-r-y j-o-r-d-a-n .
lance looked amused .
but i cannot see any such motive in m .
we cannot conceive of a life other than this oneof a life after death .
nobody , mr .
your wife is a very charming , a very accomplished woman .
no , no , i dont mean that butwell , a very frightening woman .
but then mrs pengelley made up her mind , without saying anything to you , to consult me .
the signal knock , the demand for a number , and the reply correct .
she is only one here among many .
it must have beenrather tempting .
but here , i believe , something entirely unforeseen took place .
lavinia had a very curious idea .
the thing will have to be put off , i suppose .
what was your opinion of her ?
dealing with miss mullins , i expect .
but if there should be a shortcut to power .
hed given me the thing i wanted most in the world , and he would never even know about it !
he had noticed herher grey flannel trousersthe scarlet handkerchief tied loosely around her breastthe vermilion mouth and the fact that she had chosen a cocktail in preference to tea .
so thats what you believe .
poirot regarded miss amory quizzically before he asked , you have no doubt , then , that it was dr carelli who stole sir clauds formula ?
sheppard , mr .
and george is a real doctor and everything is quite above suspicion .
the look of strain and tenseness of muscle had quite disappeared , linnet was happy .
shed take double the number , sir .
ill take my chance , but im damned if ill let this slippery old fox get away .
upward .
it might have been she and not inspector curry who was in charge of the investigation .
hercule poirot murmured : and you see there an analogy to the death of mrs .
a pattern confused at present but which will gradually become clear .
she paused and then said : but it gave me , i will tell you , a strange pleasure when i found that my son jamess greatest friend at his school was a boy whom i found to be edmunds nephew .
others have had the same idea .
youre joking , m .
the two detective officers went off together , campbell looking smart in a lounge suit (he had an excellent figure) , and chief-inspector davy carrying with him a tweedy air of being up from the country .
was this peter lordthat freckled , cheery young doctor who had been so kind and so friendly at hunterbury ?
ive seen some and i know .
cooks of any seniority were always mrs .
put it between four oclock and twenty to five .
ray stared at him .
it was pure chance that mrs .
as you say , it was only to be expected .
ultimate destination santiago .
an invalid ordered country air ?
november to third november .
yes , mother .
some friends of ours , the rivingtons , brought him down here one day for lunch .
his tone was reproachful and she flushed and bit her lip .
time passed .
im terribly interested in his work , but of course ive no special qualifications so it was out of the question for the expedition to pay my fare out .
but in the very nature of things he cannot help throwing light upon himself .
it is that .
then upstairs .
i drive down here alone and on the way to the house , i get a creative fit .
that was after she had a fall , was it not ?
jimmy still stared uncomprehendingly .
thats the question .
oh , yes , no doubt as to his identity .
the two men smoked .
you , countess , in your society gown , i in my white tie and tails .
she put it in her handbag and started out to keep the appointment she had made with mrs .
so thats victorian , really .
and he added , smiling with the arrogance of a young man who knows that he is vastly superior to any other person in the world .
all along it was ever present in the back of my mind that some one of these people might have knowledge that they had kept backknowledge incriminating the murderer .
theo turned from the window where she had been standing looking out .
and you hadnt only got to hear them once .
' she demanded impatiently .
somebody might get it away from you in the crowd at the fair .
i didnt do anything .
wellwell .
(thats just a silly joke we had .
ididnotknowshewasonthetrain , he explained , spacing his words elaborately , as though to someone dull of intellect .
you wipe the pistol and put it in his handwipe the door handle so that your prints shall not be the last .
only a matter of fifty quid , but it all helps .
was she now all passion spent , nothing but an exhausted shell ?
egg makes a great parade of her feeling for sir charles .
len , she said , you were rather terrible tonight .
he bent over the bed where the woman was lying peacefully on her side .
do you think he heard us calling his car a yellow peril ?
what had he looked like when he followed veronicas tall , triumphant figure out of that window ?
rogers , macarthur , rogers , miss brent , wargrave .
you see , he explained , as he put away a stiff whisky and soda , i thought it was nick .
we must go to her hotel .
and that is partly why i said what i did just nowthat carlas transportation to different surroundings might have been in some respects a good thing for her .
probably monsieur had never spoken that sentence in english at all , and , even if he had , it proved nothing , for madame daubreuil spoke english perfectly , and generally used that language when talking to monsieur and madame renauld .
gg _num_ , passed going direction st .
yes ; that gives one to think .
when youve finished playing with those things .
the trouble with you is , hester , its taken you longer to snap out of it than most people .
bill knows about it ?
of course its all very well for the people from the development at this point she stopped .
those social amenities satisfied , mr .
whitfield sent down grapes and peaches from his hothouse .
ellie loved riding .
she took a document from the drawer and showed it to the inspector .
land for industrial and building purposes .
some day i will kill you .
bell ?
and did he give up tea-planting because his health wouldnt stand it ?
hows that ?
but if we hadnt come to live here and ask questions and wanted to find out , it wouldnt have happened .
as she did so , dr carelli entered by the other door , carrying a hat and a small suitcase .
ii dr .
no , i meant the children that ive seen mentioned in some article here .
i wish it were something of that kind .
there are some old ones in the cupboard here .
but what i really meant was that the whole thing hinged upon one old woman being so like any other old woman .
she could have been killed , as i said , by a religious maniac , and she could have been killed by her stepdaughter .
how little i really know you !
i dare not , m .
yes , about then .
twelve i the meal was over .
she never minded discomfort if she could feel she was saving money .
i should have liked to be surebut no more of that .
thomas royde shifted in his seat .
so you do see , dont you , that if this wicked person has got a crime planned , arranged , and shortly about to take place , he couldnt afford to let major palgrave go about telling this story and showing that snapshot .
my drawing-room had a suite of blue satin chairs , to which i added by degrees a sofa and a rather grand gilded armchair .
perhaps a house that has once had a murder in it is never quite the same afterwards .
tuppence felt very uncomfortable .
he decided there was only one way outto use the coniine himself .
he was upset , of course , but no one could have been sweeter .
it was disfigured by the shot he had fired into his head .
yesterday the person a had a very near escape from death , the kind of death that might very conveniently be called an accident .
latest developments .
i hope not that whats-its-name one where they always send you crooks , he observed .
poirot looked across at her with twinkling eyes .
i trust him .
the list i have just read , said poirot , is a list of suspected persons .
bundles watch had stopped , but she judged that over an hour had passed since the russian had brought her here .
no , no , my dear sir .
then some dagos came monkeying around .
lord mayfield is very emphatic as to his innocence .
it would underline the point that it is unwise to make jokes about murder , said poirot drily .
though professing himself willing to remember anything he could , his recollections of the previous evening were of the vaguest description .
when she was talking i got a picture of a manand it wasnt a man like ellsworthy .
he was quite high up in the treasury , you know .
strong foreign element .
they chatted for a while .
cleat is the local witch .
franklin agreed that the laboratory was usually kept locked and that he usually had the key in his pocket .
george heaved a sigh of relief .
of course , anyone might have gone out walking from there .
butyesmost certainly let us tackle him .
a snare cunningly laida net with cordsa pit open at his feetdug carefully so that he should fall into it .
she hadnt touched it herself .
ah , you said that ?
it was an alarming experience , admitted miss blacklock .
by the way , how did you hear ?
he was spare and grey-hairedbut he had not the lawyers imperturbability .
the papers were safe so far , but i couldnt take the risk of leaving them there any longer .
the important thing is , that well know were on the right track .
when she got up and went away , so i supposed shed just slipped or something .
john st .
i ran a column on your garden in the sunday mail for a year in my younger days .
i keep an open mind .
for answer ackroyd groaned and dropped his head into his hands .
lucy said demurely : thank you , mr .
and then an open window .
it is most rare that anyone does an action that is not dans son caractre .
' he ' d been here for years and years .
six concerning an ink stain mr .
it was a hot , clear summers day .
ive no doubt that i was shadowed the whole time .
strange , privately ?
she opened it without much interest , but she found its contents intriguing : at delphi you can no longer consult the oracle (so it ran) , but you can consult mr .
nothing so far has contradicted my little ideathat is why .
to my knowledge i have not this lady seen before .
what would she hear ?
if she had had any doubts , they were swept aside .
it gets me down .
philip lombard said : i dont fancy you will , blore .
nothing must be said to emphasize the fact that the host had himself transgressed the stringent rule of the house .
besides , he added with a sigh , my daughter wont let me .
theres no sense anywhere .
to tell you the truth , i thought of using some of the characters at the house party at melfort abbey .
rose emily templeton was given as the wife of edgar templeton of tudor cottage , chipping somerton .
nadine sat down beside her .
we never seem to stop running into each other .
busybodies wrote letters to the papers about it .
why say it even if it were true ?
he sprang up and helped her to a chair .
besides , william p .
somewhat surprised , i got up and went to it .
heregive me that hat .
i was brought up very carefully .
perhaps he will do one some day .
damned young ass .
cant you feel it yourself ?
because he could visualize almost all of these people as a possiblethough not a probablemurderer .
you were rightand i was wrong .
its this appallingly healthy bucolic life she leads that makes her so energetic .
im a very good wife .
all right , all right , its true enough !
its the sort of half-baked idea one has when one is young , but fortunately one doesnt carry it out .
as long as i live i shall never forget the hopeless agony of phylliss face .
i thought you called for something , madam .
it would have been rather a nasty shock to him if hed come across her on it .
tanios , mrs .
a few days at the majesticthats what we need .
burton , that you might help him to bear up under the shock .
lonely women in shops might conceivably have been warned .
she looked around .
it might have been me .
day after day with nothing to do , and val so absorbed in business .
its all right , i tell you .
dont you think we have rather burnt our boats now ?
this panel business too , said nick , reflectively .
' i do not like all this !
gathered from old mans manner that he was suspected .
odd rolls of wallpaper were cut and pasted over boxes .
he could see all right , but he could only see with one eye .
thats how she got taken to the police station .
always darkest before dawn , i said reassuringly .
looking out of the glass pane she saw pat fortescue walking up and down the terrace outside .
quitequite , said poirot soothingly .
she really meant it , you know , it wasnt just a gesture .
ii think hell kill me .
my father has been to edinburgh to give a lecture there , and we have stayed with friends also .
mark said deliberately : common or garden gold-digger .
honestly i couldnt say i thought so !
fifty-five at least , said mrs .
so you know that , do you ?
just press the bell , will you , emily ?
you couldnt possibly have seen who it was , said the inspector sharply .
they can tell roughly , you know , how long a man has had a scar .
i cant go through another night !
never been down here yet he hadnt .
yes , when lady ravenscroft was ill , and had been in hospital , zlie came back and was sort of companion to her and looked after her .
but do you think i think nothing .
go on , battle , he said .
ireally it seemed quite natural to say all these things .
four of them gave up their secret .
tell me , my man , he said .
no , i said slowly .
personally i should loathe anyone reading aloud to me .
i came to the conclusion that mrs .
i knew amyas crale and his father , richard crale , and i can remember enoch cralethe grandfather .
price ridley was among the last to hear the news .
she may have seen somethingthe major administering a soothing cup of beef tea or gruel ?
bundle puzzled over that point now .
in them there had been mention of a young man .
at that moment the knocker was sounded .
yes , bill , h-i-p hip , b-a-n-d band .
its only to go to the funeral in , said tommy .
raynor began , then paused .
he described some of them to mereally most peculiari hope , i do hope , he is not insane .
colonel race departed silently to do my bidding .
never did like the idea of her being killed before ten twenty .
right back to the time of the armada , it was .
about the chances of the weather lasting .
courtship is , after all , a recognised stage in all animals .
she said : i didnt realize it would be ahospital .
nothing professional , that is to say .
thewhat one used to call the factors at schoolare the same .
his inquiries were not fruitful .
i was just a mite hasty .
between them they lifted the limp body , carried it across the deserted corridor (in the distance marcus voice could be heard upraised in furious anger) and laid it on dakins bed .
i remember one day we made an excursion to banbury .
he said very gently and softly : leslie ?
to the detriment of somebody else .
blood was dripping slowly on to the floor , but the wound itself had long ceased to bleed .
i was a fool .
ive just seen a murder !
i look always on both sides .
miss sainsbury seale , i knew , took a _num_ -inch stockingthat is to say she would take at least a _num_ in shoes .
she was staring at him , wide eyed horror struck .
i am devoted to her , but half the time i dont listen to what she says because it just doesnt make sense .
minotaur .
every time you go to a friends house , you find some kind of a notice in the loopress sharply and release , pull to the left , release quickly .
shes trying to think it out while i came round to you .
they told you the indian story , didnt they ?
no oneexcept the waiter , of course .
you still can if its a suicide pact .
it isnt the people who ostensibly lead the rioters that were after .
nonsense , john had said .
well , he reflected , now i come to think of it , she was a bit quiet .
here , hilary found , they were to resume european clothing .
chicken coops in the grandiose manner all over the countryside !
he was a little startled to find her eyes cool and amused .
we shall get there , said jessop obstinately .
you say you heard a ring at the bell some time after your wife left the room ?
the pearls still make a convenient excuse , even though they have been returnedbut miss bowers is not likely to advertise the fact .
i mean i didnt really know him .
life is very cruel , said james bentley .
curtin shook her head .
im a simple fellowand i cant pretend to understand these thingsbut i saw what i sawand because of what i saw , sylvia and i are together in the old-fashioned wordstill death do us part .
fond of her ?
you are a man who appreciates good acting when you see it .
burton left the severe rectangular room .
it was an evening bag .
but i wouldnt trust him a yard .
yes , thank you , darling , she replied .
now he saw the red mount slightly in her cheeks , but she replied composedly : no , who was that ?
they both embroidered him a cope or something , and he wore the durrant womans first .
thats a most offensive remark , inspector .
he was still lying on his face on the turf .
if so , our best bet is to go round the house agents .
georges jaw dropped .
sounds very russian , murmured miss marple to herself .
that was only mrs .
she beckoned him to her and spoke in a whisper .
taverner summed it up .
i presume all goes well with them .
she took some aspirin , though .
the domestics had withdrawn tactfully , and the crofts had been asked to accompany the police .
so you think that if joyce reynolds came out with a tale that shed seen a murder committed , youd say she was probably lying and you wouldnt believe the story was true ?
the ac gave in .
baker and hilary she displayed a certain amount of contempt as towards people unworthy to associate with her .
he said nothing else , but to joyce that oh !
poirot turned to meredith blake .
on the next two rows there was sister stubbs , a small sister , gay and pleasant to the girls , who often called them dear and , having lured them into false security , lost her temper with them vehemently if anything went wrong .
barron she hesitated .
outside in the hall there was a diminishing hum of voices as various people took their leave and departed .
it would only sound like the pop of a cork .
the glass of pilsner on the tablenothing in it that there shouldnt have beenneither then , nor later .
plenty of evidence once you look for it .
one must look forward all the time .
and i shall knowin spite of you all .
i never remember anything more frightening than being conveyed down the flight of steep stairs to the hall .
the lad rose from his seat and shuffled unsteadily to hamers side , where he stood on the edge of the platform peering into the tunnel .
thomas .
could there have been anyone else ?
but there was nothing young or beautiful about this woman .
i had one long , final argument with my uncle .
a picture of the kings palace in montenegro , another of the great exhibition .
and weve got to find out and were going to find out .
in due course we went up together , visiting sites in the north of iraq , between the lesser and the greater zab , until we arrived at the picturesque mound and town of erbil .
presently rosalind was there again .
he lived in an apartment five flights up with no lift .
good morning , lady frances .
leaning back against the rocks , she talked , telling him of her life at home in yorkshire , of her dogs and the aunt who had brought her up .
my friends , he said , we must telephone for the police .
the rain had stopped now , and the sky was clearing in that sudden way it does .
i took the boys up and started to lay tea .
anne barely knew him .
she was really alarmed now .
clair jones .
i feel im being put under the microscope .
ever since the date of the fte everything that my wife has eaten or drunk has tasted odd .
thats the difficulty with our dr .
they were both quite right .
perhaps theyre in an igloo somewhere , or in a tent in morocco or in a chalet in switzerland .
you are now your own mistress .
she looked from clotilde to lavinia to anthea .
but , you see , mere men being in charge , weve got to be careful .
everyone was so happy .
y-es , said pilar doubtfully .
theres a sofa there .
he noticed it again now .
i really find it all quite interesting .
(and , talking of that , how much crime depends , too , on that psychological moment .
good god , man .
you just said it would be awkward for you if this man was identified .
well , i dont like to leave you too long on your own , dear , in case you get moped .
rathboneedward !
was this nonsense , or could it , perhaps be true ?
that popped out so pat that i suspect hed got it ready beforehand .
a mixture of fear and guilt had wrung the truth from mrs .
not exactly a grudge , butwell , james told me only this morning that hed dismissed him .
she had her vision of what a school should be and she had pursued it unafraid .
she added , not even the people who are nearest to you .
i didnt like it much myself .
i am glad because that shows that you love me .
yes , celia told me .
her eyes flashed with anger .
why , then , hercule poirot ?
but then , youre a very powerfully built man , arent you , sir oswald ?
there was a little stir of interest , but m .
i have the utmost faith in you , said mr .
dont be a fool , rex !
supplied on prescription or can it be bought freely ?
no , i suppose not , agreed elvira .
this is murder .
tommy sighed .
anyone could walk in .
he said very softly : cest la fin !
marlene giggled .
sergeant pollock looked at his superior officer curiously .
its daft , i agreed .
mrs bartletts laugh rang out .
and that is that , said poirot to me , as we left the suite .
i want you to tell me because im sure you must know or perhaps have a very good idea how it all came about .
come back to the boat , madame , poirot said quickly .
noshe was murdered .
edith de haviland got up and said : i think weve discussed this enough .
until the last minute i keep everything here , he tapped his forehead .
difficulties soon began .
in the doorway she paused a minute looking at the group at the far end of the table .
seddon gave a deprecating cough .
he said : have you received any anonymous letters in the past year , lady alexandra ?
katherine smiled thoughtfully .
yes , you have something more to tell us , said poirot firmly .
what is it that you want to know ?
you could not guess , i am sure , what my profession is , mademoiselle ?
he said : i dare say you have guessed , miss waynflete , that the reason of my coming here is not merely to write a book on local customs ?
you see ior rather my friend , jimmy mcgrath , has been very neatly done out of a thousand pounds .
the sounds came from the librarya violent crashing of chairs being overturned .
langton would never .
writings not particularly enjoyable .
i always knew there was a catch in it .
i cleared away the lunch things and laid the table here as you see for supper .
in any case , i am above suspicion .
some other bloody careless electrician , he said .
i told you that , and yet i dont even remember telling you that .
summerhayes kept it , she would have kept it innocently , and so her fingerprints should have been on it .
victoria , not at all averse to free hospitality , consented gladly .
the superintendent jerked harder than ever .
the doctor went on : youve a feeling , havent you , that somethings wrong ?
i will take it to her myself and explain the whole circumstances .
there were other times , i think , when she didnt want to talk about her .
her dark hair was cropped closely and shaped to her head .
its when you want to do things economically , they wont play .
theyve got names underneath them too .
(oh dear , thats a very long time ago !
those sheep who told you about the sheep ?
starkwedder got up from his footstool and went across to richard warwicks body .
james eccles .
the only person he goes for is the postman .
seizing adroitly on the name , poirot said : well , mrs .
tell us some more , please .
poor bunnynot long to live anyway and perhaps a painful end .
how is it that nobody in the house heard the shot tonight ?
she must not leave .
it occurred to me it would be easier to write to my mother from abroad .
thank youmr henry winterspoon .
but i suppose even you couldnt persuade your wife to keep out of danger .
i do and i dont , said inspector neele .
have you not tortured me enough , all of you ?
he had heard of strange cases where girls apparently just as sane and well-balanced as margery had done the most amazing things .
all was in readiness .
i knewi knew that he wouldnt see what i was seeing .
she laughed and said she came of a gambling family and i could .
it is not a thing of direct information , it is a question of what you believe .
they stood in a little group on the ground , shivering a little .
well enjoy the delightful society in this hotel a few weeks longer .
actually i think the pensionnat was run by you , mademoiselle meauhourat .
i know what you mean .
the two essentials for a story were a title and a plotthe rest was mere spadework , sometimes the title led to a plot all by itself , as it were , and then all was plain sailingbut in this case the title continued to adorn the top of the page , and not the vestige of a plot was forthcoming .
because i once did work for m .
i agree that the marriage is not a suitable one .
as she placed it on the table , m .
' yes , his own .
he looked up at the house , but it was dark and silent .
he is , as you have perceived , honest .
he had always kept it , and in it he kept two poems she had written him .
paynter , but acting in obedience to the suspicions dr .
i hastened out of the room and just got up the stairs before parker opened the front door to you .
of course ellis told me you had sent for her and questioned her , but i gathered it was all something to do with bryan martin .
trotter swung round .
i was dummy .
not if she married the right person .
the inspector turned back to face mrs warwick and the others .
they passed on to tim allertons cabin , next door .
only i dont think i rebuff herin fact i am quite sure i dont .
i dont say hes your man but if you are going to suspect someone i say hes by far and away the most likely .
the funny thing was that im almost sure id met her somewhere .
i was conducting a case .
that is well then , murmured the comte .
which way ?
violet willett had fainted .
a poacher , in and out of prison , capable of anything .
ruby necklace worth fifty thousand pounds missing .
i know how to play this hand .
then that idea of yours might come in useful .
they think somethings wonderful , or they think somethings devilish , or they think its something terribly important .
but it isnt funny .
but unwittingly , he left her to face the music .
you might put it that way , perhaps .
and what did it say , said mrs .
go ahead , joe , said the bigger of the two .
henry hailsham-browns first marriage was unfortunate .
mr starkwedder picked it upthis gun .
was that a usual proceeding of his when he had guests ?
the other mistresses , they are at least polite .
she was quite incapable of not telling exactly what was in it .
i accompanied him out to his car .
it had a village shop and a post office and about a dozen small houses or cottages .
weve got to answer that before we can get anywhere .
i wonder who did it .
i am not quite sure i yet understand it .
is this a new kind of witchcraft ?
then one things quite clear .
and now we come to the willetts .
dysonlucky ?
but ive come across people like that .
upwards house , the fair-haired woman that edna saw , was mrs .
she always seems able to do anything she wants to do .
you have been warned , she quoted .
about six feet of grass separated it from the path .
cheer up , poirot , the luck will change .
yours , the one ive got now , was restrung .
i love the man , the real , human man .
he felt dazed .
the pistol !
all right , ill tell you .
really , nobody could be nicer than she was .
they were so angry !
i would have given him the money if he would have taken it , but it seems that kind of thing cant be done .
here ladies sat and did their fancywork , and if a cigarette was ever smoked by a favoured member of the male sex , what a shaking out of curtains and general airing of the room there would be afterwards !
who was to have hadthe accident ?
there was stained glass at the top of the windows .
she was at the funeral , was she ?
why , if you dont mind , id like to join your party this morning .
' delicately , poirot cleared his throat .
it is possible , you know , that it may have been there for some time .
somehow that made a difference .
i like ancestors .
one can take ones choice .
that is correct , i think , said mr .
frankly , nigel always gave me the creepsand at last i see why .
i tried it out .
nash was patient with her but firm .
quentin placed the port in front of him , and withdrew noiselessly .
well , then , said jane helier , she was all right .
and you rang the bell , didnt you ?
you want me to go , dont you , hilda ?
yes , i said mildly .
aime griffiths play can be summed up in her own words .
why then did the murderer take it away ?
i see now that it was but the careless and charming levity of a child .
that was japp .
tell him that that isnt true , jason .
they would not have wanted an interview .
he looked with some curiosity at colonel pikeaway .
advance now , george , advance , and put your hand on my shoulder .
thats only mywell , its only my idea .
because i was a coward , she said .
ratchett described him to me .
the great thing is to be able to say that her majestys government , etc .
and all this week north of the thames , gaumont cinemasthe walls of jericho , featuring olga radbourne and bart levinne , said father .
so youve seen sense at last , snapped the old lady .
i asked them to stay in the drawing-room until i was ready to take their statements .
or else he suggested it better than i could have believed possible .
the difficulty was that archdeacon simmons was arriving this evening and archdeacon simmons would expect to find a host to receive him .
miss bulstrode followed kelsey into the hall .
the papers are safe at the air ministry .
and then poirot noticed a decorative basket of small round dog biscuits .
he will arrive by the _num_ : _num_ .
i took it , for the moment uncomprehending .
he spoke comfortably and cosily .
morning , claude , said mr .
perhaps she is afraid of miss pettigrew .
would you mind very much if he joined us ?
the face was pleasant but weak and his manner seemed oddly apathetic .
now ive come back im not the same person who went away .
i suppose it must have been about ten o ' clock .
oh , well , she said at last , it would not have done .
had felt that depression that reaches its nadir at _num_ a .
he may have died without knowing who his assailant was .
ill see you home , he said .
we had reached the door when the girl spoke .
i met him here for the first time two days ago , sir rowland replied .
no , chloral .
perhaps because he is screening someone , suggested poirot , watching her .
the maid ?
she thought that she was just the person for rosalind , would be sorry for her because she was shy and nervous , and would look after her .
just tell me , once more , are you quite sure that agnes never mentioned to you being worried over anythingsince mrs .
then he said suddenly , mrs .
we will go round at once , my friend , he said , and lovingly brushing an imagined speck of dust from his hat , he put it on his head .
rebecca arnholt , owing to the calamitous deaths of two brothers and a cousin in an air accident , was sole heiress to immense wealth .
do you want to see mr .
quite so , he said ; quite so !
seddon winced .
neat , said colonel carbury approvingly .
queer that that had not worried him beforehand .
and the name of your yacht , mr .
did you really think i was the kind of girl to roll about on the floor and whine for mercy ?
perhaps these are the missing onesor perhaps perhaps what ?
you mustnt be impatient .
ah , my friend , i am like a giant refreshed .
it was not daylight yet .
' mrs gold came straight up the beach .
anthony returned her glance keenly .
we told a good many lies , said zlie .
on the other hand she had no imagination .
ive had a return of that pain after food lately , remarked ackroyd calmly , as he helped himself to coffee .
adele and elaine , and a minute or two later lance arrived .
driven to the stage where he would take his own life in despair .
suspect whom ?
come ?
i wondered what shed really thought of our house .
it was satisfactory to come home and find everything just as usual .
i was passing through this neighbourhood and i ventured to call upon you here in the hope that i might be allowed to pay my respects to sir roderick horsefield .
good afternoon , miss plenderleith , said japp formally .
i assent .
i want you to think of this place as a stage set , inspector .
she was wearing a white tennis frock and a pale blue pullover .
of course , from the moment that the girl in manchester was proved to be a plant everything was altered .
as she went out sims said to him , i didnt quite get what you said through the telephone something about the girl having a friend .
no , nothey are subtlebut not so subtle as hercule poirot .
we cant have the whole show a fiasco because of these idiotic womens local feuds .
some of the best years of my life , too old miss marple inclined her head .
theres a bit i didnt hear , said colonel pikeaway , the bit about lohengrin .
was she in a nursing home or did she live with a companion orshe never married , did she ?
or distressed ?
anyway , said rosalind , freddie was very brave about it .
he explained that he had left me at deaths door in athens .
oh , lucy , dont .
satterthwaite impressed her favourably .
i should make mine a special mission , i should .
oh , you think perhapsyes , i see .
oh , i daresay i was a fool to do anything of the sort .
some story that the husband shot the other two and then shot himself .
tell me now , m .
however much we wish it , we are powerless .
but , grandmother , that could not be !
it wont , tuppence assured him positively .

he had to go off on that kurdish business .
so there it ismaybe underhays buried up country in the midst of equatorial africa but maybe he isntand if he isnt mrs .
have you seen the little fellow safely back to his cottage ?
she repeated , you do not understand .
at first , as i told you , i was inclined to suspect her of being concerned in the crime .
i thought this was your car .
even now , i said , i can hardly believe it .
dear sir , ive just thought of something .
she piled the tray with the remains of supper and carried it over to the sink .
i finished the second coffee soda and demanded a maple one .
and yet it was stupid of me , renisenb went on .

she came to help tuppence to her feet , but tuppence rose unaided .
shall we come into this room here on the leftmr .
it was as simple as that !
and the waistlines rather penetrating .
we could go and ask dr .
the head of the assassins .
i myself nearly had the same idea .
it was for blackmail !
i shouldnt like to say more .
she talked a lot but she didnt really know much .
she wasnt clever like ann , nor as clever as her little brother leopold , either , but she wanted to be .
theyd all know , said huish .
jane plenderleith made an impatient gesture .
aunt ada was silent until tuppence had gone out of the door with miss packard and tommy followed her .
when they came i slid the blotting paper up a little , exposing the bottom of a document , signed my name and caused them to sign theirs .
quite , said roddy .
is it good soup ?
left everything to the opera girl , said elspeth , because of her devoted care and kindness .
yes , i think perhaps she has .
tucker keeps her home nice , clean as a pinyoungest of eleven , she was .
a prosperous appearance .
had she not openly avowed her intention of marrying for money if she ever had the chance ?
never moves out of this place .
but it is possible .
a mean little smile crept across pierre vauchers face .
hes next door to me , and i dont like it .
so that is that , i remarked , as the door closed behind the young secretary .
about any love affairs the husband or wife had , about any money that somebody might have inherited .
brown !
he came forward into the room smiling in his genial way .
everything had happened too quickly and too improbably .
the inspector smiled rather ruefully .
miss marple smiled but made no answer .
still he considered a minute or two she had a kind of intensity about her .
anyway there it was and he said come up and see the studio and so i came up rather a rickety staircase .
you wanted to pick my pocket .
her clothes were always just right and she wore them well .
i rather think that i shall be invited to take part in the orgies at the next meeting of the satanic games whenever that may be .
did one of an old great-aunt of mine .
he was fairly certain that he had extracted all that mrs .
isnt there a possible link there ?
he took the wrong bottle off the shelf in the dark .
shes certain i did it .
me i am not an englishman , said hercule poirot .
theres a place round the corner where theres usually a taxi driver got his cab parked , having a warm up and a drop of something to keep the cold out .

they came to me because they were in love with each other and wanted to get married .
his voice was virtuous in the extreme .
its not true , richard , lucia cried .
she looked inquiringly at inspector neele .
inquired sir oswald coldly .
you neednt worry , said susan .
i knew nothing about egypt and said so .
distressingsadly distressing , said sir george packham .
i mention these things , he said apologetically , not because they are relevant to the storystrictly speaking , they are notbut to convey an atmosphere , the atmosphere of young mrs .
delighted , said horace eagerly .
they all went out with miss king , said lady westholme .
but you do not approve of it ?
you can send me a bill for the consultation fee .
the capting he rented this place , i came in to do for him every day , and i dont mind telling you , sir , that i had been hoping that by the end of the winter the capting would have come round to the idea ; and that me and rebecca would go back to sittaford with him .
let me see clarissa began to stammer .
i suppose theyre normas friends .
what happened in the house ?
the patterns of curtains , carpets and chintzes .
truths !
hes a good dancer .
i think you are one of the people who would appreciate her pluck and her spirit .
renounce the devil and all his works in my name , said celia .
ereryes .
he nudged his companion .
but the first appearance was deceptive ; there was a subtle distortionan amazing brilliance and clarity in the light .
aa spanish girl ?
well , the fact is , my aunt said she wanted to see you , and i was to come along and tell you so .
and really , thomas , i cant help sympathizing with her .
but youre not going at once , cried flora .

cried ridgeway .

shes a regular spinster .
' ' there was nothing sensational about it .
sweetly pretty , i say .
she says not and she should know .
you know that if i could speak now i would .
it always annoyed rosamund when people had no clothes sense .
but john would never be there again .
my mother told me later that my father had been much disappointed by the reception of his gift .

she unfolded a copy of the continental daily mail .
he is known internationally as an authority on opera , and has written number of books on musical and literary subjects , among them the complete operas of verdi ( _num_ ) , wagner and his world ( _num_ ) , w .
noas i tried to ask a questioni will say no more .
she clutched at a table for support .
cavendish did not believe her .
some old friend he hadnt seen for a long timehe could have gone off with a friend to the friends hotel or the friends house , but he wouldnt have stayed there three days , would he ?
that girl annie was no goodskirts up to her knees and wouldnt wear sensible woollen stockings .
nowadays , even the fishermen dont know about it .
the boy stood on the burning deckwhooshwhooshwhoosh(the flames , you see) whence all but he had fledfor that bit i run to and fro like a dog .
it took a little getting used tothe knowledge that someone had tried to kill you .
she wanted to turn a few things over in her mind .
i dont know , she almost whispered it .
theres that big clock in the corner , grandfather they call it , and theres the cuckoo clock on the wall .
are you thinking of settling in this neighbourhood ?
you see , it was not so very terrible .
i was being carried away by my feeling for period .
cried poirot , disappearing into his bedroom , and reappearing with a hat .
opening the door into the corridor , he called for the conductor .
you can hardly expect her to be able to read .
dont you worry , captain hastings .
there are tall bushes growing just over the edge .
welman , at any period of her life , make a will ?
vandemeyers sudden and inexplicable agitation .
she was louise birell when i knew her .
en vrit .
one cannot get it here .
should she risk all and cry out an appeal for help ?
merrowdene explained , when they arrived at the charming old-world cottage .
his face took on a worried expression .
because , said philip , there are lots of ways of finding out things , of knowing them quite certainly once and for all .
yes , strangled !
she screamed .
and youre all right ?
miss marple said gently , its very fortunate for her that shetook an overdose .
bridget got in .
one feels just the same .
he half held out his hand .
in fact these crimes were exactly what they seemed !
ill kill myself , she cried .
when i realized the possibility of mademoiselle bruns being an imposter , and added to that the fact that her face was familiar to mrs .
well , the reynolds were there .
alloallo .
i told her something about papas life work .
i only had one nephew and he was called william .
probably be barely able to support you .
thats the stumbling block , said sir charles thoughtfully .
now , where were we ?
abbot , the solicitor , and young dr .
it fleeted across poirots mind that it seemed to be cornelias fate either to be bullied or instructed .
carry on where i leave off ?
when i came back emmott told me what had happened and i went back in the bus to get the police and dr .
now i wonderthat reminds me what does that remind you of ?
hand in glove with the great detective , and not a hint as to the way things are going .
you say he is very rich or you say he is enormously rich , and your voice just goes down a little because its so impressive , isnt it , when you meet someone who is immensely rich .
the inspector queried , turning sharply to her .
she used to follow annette around like a dog .
i really just went for a walkin regents park .
he told me to tell holmes (holmes is the butler) that a gentleman would be calling at nine-thirty .
by contrast , the noises on the train seemed unusually loud .
bateman created a further diversion .
she moved uneasily .
bantry drily .
the sound of a car came through the open window .
ii at the savoy hotel mr .
you see , hastings , we must now start again .
he tried out his murder before committing it .
brenda ?
he was grateful to her for that .
the eyes that met poirots were hard and unflinching .
how long would it take ?
i wasnt really his type and i knew it .
pity , too .
i wonder what kind of freudian complex he would put that answer down to .
and was a feast indeed .
alfred said : he treated youall of usdisgracefully .
emily waters , thats who she reminds me of , miss marple was saying to herself , with the satisfaction it always gave her to match up a human personality with one known in the past .
youll be very surprised , really , at what im going to say , said mrs .
tommy got into trouble with him ?
elstrees in north london .
old achmeds all right .
true enough , there was no sign of any such thing .
you agree that you have seen six figures representing the italian comedy ?
we went for a walk together .
ryland had probably been suffering from the enemy of his racedyspepsia .
boucs shoulder .
what do you do with the money ?
lord kidderminster was consulted and was all in favour of encouraging the young hopefuls of the political world .
getting no reply , she fetched george , and insisted on the door being broken open .
it was a shock , of course .
its gone to brothers , to nephews , to second sons never to the eldest son .
sometimes , when you talk to her , she might be a woman of twenty-five .
third , that they were written by someone who deliberately copied her handwriting .
it was the direct consequence of her own actions .
by the time we had got to the third glass of sherry , griffith was telling her about some obscure reaction or lesion in such scientific terms that nobody could have understood a word of it except a fellow medico .
very correct , poirot thought approvingly .
however , the dedicated poirotist may wish to note that the great detective is returning from a little affair in syria at the start of murder on the orient express .
you understand that ?
' dear me , that ' s too bad .
she did not feel as the evening progressed that she was getting to know dr .
but to write it down beforehand in that methodical mannerinsanity !
also , since she is doing england , she must certainly spend a fortnight at the seasideas a good tourist , if nothing else .
i was quite unprepared for the effect of my question .
and remember what marriot once said about the amateur point of viewthat it had the intimacy .
you do not know that mrs .
that , i said , is one of the cattiest things you could say about anyone .
what does joanna say ?
now we come to what i may call the dividing of two separate threads .
to be in the sketchwonderful !
yes , marriot , it has been a very dangerous job .
she said : mark thinks i ought to have seen what was coming .
what really worries me is yesgo on several wealthy women have been among the devotees .
iveive barely spoken to her .
she looked startled , and jack ran up to her triumphantly , crying out : you heard it this time , anyway .
and what then ?
anne meredith went over to the fireplaceand saw that mr .
haverings movements on the night in question had been checked and verified , and it was proved beyond doubt that he had actually arrived in london by the train in question .
but listen , my dear alix , i want to ask you to do me a great favour , if you will .
it was not quite as large as no .
i suppose its all on account of me and my bathing dress .
a dance ?
she said sharply : suicide ?
one sees , perhaps , motives that the ordinary person would pass by .
now what is the earliest point to note down ?
he added , i think you know that , madame , as well as i do .
some chord of memory vibrated in bundles mind .
she felt wakeful lying on her big four-poster bed .
the room was still untouched , and poirot idly gathered up the cards , shuffling them with his tiny , fastidiously groomed hands .
he said , glancing down at the typewritten sheets in poirots hand : done anything with those cases , sir ?
i found myself telling her all about it .
the trance and the white cocks and the brazier and the pentagrams and the voodoo and the reversed crucifixall that was for the crudely superstitious .
someone should stay hereyes , i am sure someone should stay here .
she ticked them off from the list as colonel and mrs .
there was something queer in the way he said the last word .
father came back pretty certain that there was no gold there .
a mixture of a hospital nurse , a secretary , a companion , an au pair girl , an uncles help ?
at the age of eighteen he became a junior clerk in a big business house .
no , she would have a gay wallpaper .
' we have on board with ' , , m .
she said to beatrice .
depend upon it , it was a woman .
it will be between you and me only .
a soothing murmur added itself to the clamour .
never say to yourself that anyone is above suspicion .
she pushed sir rowland towards the sofa , and moved away .
he thinks her good fun , that is all .
lately i have felt very badly the need for a problem .
youve got the keys still , havent you , poirot ?
exclaimed craddock .
he had known the claytons for some years and major rich also .
that is just what i cannot say , mademoiselle .
i said , damned fool that i was : we must think it over carefully .
let us not confuse the mind .
a sulky-looking girl in a pink overall with a flight of bluebirds down the front of it took their order for coffee and cakes with a yawn and an air of weary patience .
it neednt be the channeli shall make it the french coast .
and he would say no more on the matter .
that , my friend , is the story .
think of that !
it is this man sandford who got the girl into trouble ?
im going donkey-riding .
thereabouts , said albert davis , the other steward .
i can only assure you , madame , that i am leaving no stone unturned .
she barked out short sentences rather than spoke them , and was generally of somewhat alarming aspect .
poirot murmured : alas !
only it did seem curious , didnt it , that the jobs people found for him so often seemed to take him out of england .
starkwedder replied .
you ought to be careful , dear , said dorothy .
just as she got to the door , she encountered a tall man with grey hair and a puffy face , who uttered an exclamation of surprise .
she thought : im alive again , sane , whole .
that , no one will dispute , is easily compassed by a person of the smallest physical strength .
the trouble is , she said apologetically , i didnt really listen very closely .
the talk spread and grew .
he began to study them .
now , i promise that anything you say to me will go no further .
leidner , i said cheerfully .
and he is saying to her that his father killed his mother , and that , pour a , he has changed his name .
backed clarigold .
and hes not a professional man ; it wouldnt ruin him , or anything like that .
their heads crushed inthe big counterweight must have fallen on them .
i suppose they could have if they had chanced to come in while i was out of the room .
people with a grudge against her ?
the kitchen !
yes , madre ?
six what was the marchmont woman doing here ?
the lapse of time , and her absence , will defeat all suspicion .
noi was putting my tools away , was the gardeners reply .
and monsieur your husband , is he down on the beach ?
ralph !
inspector craddock said diplomatically that it was certainly a theory .
but hes always keen on seeing young people enjoy themselveswatches the tennis and the bathing and all thatand gives parties for young people here .
on one door was painted the legend clerks .
you may say that i had gone to ask megan to marry me in an absurdly complacent frame of mind and that i deserved what i gotbut it was not really like that .
you know that one of the letters was written from chimneys ?
lombard said : precisely .
and there is the third rare motive , murder for an idea , which implies some form of mental derangement on the part of the murderer .
so your sister took the job ?
he seems to have acted very well , with promptitude and presence of mind .
theres a difference between simplicity and darns and patches .
she may have gone up sittaford beacon to see the sunset , suggested mr .
then he opened the drawer of the table .
she was a tyrannical old martinetshe was a mental sadistshe was an incarnation of evilshe was crazy .
one can go a few steps further .
but you didnt think it would be miss maggie .
in the taxi , he sighed and wiped his forehead .
mcgintydown on her knees scrubbing other peoples houses , mrs .
the dr .
you thinkyou think it isnt over yet .
careyit wasnt what he said because he hardly said anythingand that of the most ordinary nature , and it wasnt what he did , for that didnt amount to much eitherand yet you just couldnt help noticing him , and everything about him seemed to matter more than it would have about anyone else .
and from now on , order would reign .
tuckerton .
i mean , i really couldnt see the purpose in that .
it is even in some ways beneficent .
yesat scarborough .
hercule poirot went on : from the moment that i started my investigations there was always the strong possibility that elinor carlisle was guilty of the crime of which she was accused .
ive been waiting for you .
i can tell you , monsieur .
got plenty of stores in , i hope ?
nine young mr .
he was telling me how he founded his first newspaper .
that isnt what i asked you , miss bence .
, and a good deal more which , it appeared , was the same thing , only differently arrived at !
but he worried me horribly .
general ravenscroft went out and i went after him .
then , indicating an old man who was at work upon one of the flower beds in the garden , he asked : was that old man the gardener here in your aunts time ?
to think of the capting being done in !
his tone was mocking , but i fancied that an undercurrent of seriousness lay beneath it .
i dont mean a fortune or anything like that .
sixteen the inquest i miss marple walked slowly along the village street on her way towards the market place where the inquest was to take place in the old-fashioned georgian building which had been known for a hundred years as the curfew arms .
miss bulstrode was faintly surprised by the tense , although she did not show it .
we havent got a body , and if we attempted to detain de sousa in this country wed have a hornets nest about our ears .
had to walk a couple of miles to the nearest garage and they werent good for muchjust a village affair .
said georges , rather taken aback .
zero hour will be twenty-five past exactly , said elvira .
i make it a rule to be in bed by half past eleven .
attitude ?
the weariness had gone out of olivers manner .
i soon discovered that miss lawson could not have seen theresa at all clearlynot clearly enough to recognize her features .
the doctor spoke out sharply and authoritatively : you are asleep , lady astwell , but you hear me , and you can answer my questions .
modernize that !
and yet it was all wrong , said garroway .
no , no , i protested , laughing .
of course youre fond of him .
you must have lots of real gardeners .
poirot , quavered the clergyman .
and he had thanked her and said no .
but could any drug make a man have the hallucination that he was strangling his wife ?
you look worn out .
but it would have meant so much he broke off , stiffening all over .
he answered : yes , travelling by train is rather trying in this weather .
and supposeexcuse methat it was ?
xiv poirot looked round him .
some nice young constable had called round for them .
it doesnt mean that they died together , but i think they are together .
one day he announced real fresh herringsfrom the east coast .
but miss vansittart he hesitated for a moment , his eyes going to where miss bulstrode sat listening to them .
how do they get to know ?
no , said lejeune , thoughtfully .
young men of promise , young men of achievement .
he said , and smiled .
courez !
my dear luke , i simply cant believe it !
ryder was not strictly sober .
can you tell me something about them , perhaps ?
im very glad , said leo , that you have got this idea for the future .
this first decade of her writing career found christie searching for a formula that suited her talents .
but how did the fellow get in ?
bill groaned .

this meeting was in many ways a meeting of a different kind yet it promised to be no less historic .
you will not take the one from cookshe is too expensivebut i assure you this one is very respectable .
one or more of those passengers killed ratchett .
gardner was back by then ?
we must find the motive if we are to understand this crime .
there doesnt seem to be anything that warns girls against a certain type of man .
yes , go on , said miss marple .
henrietta said vehemently : and that was so unimportantso completely unimportant .
would there be time in that ten minutes for you to run round the outside of the house , change your shoes , climb in through the window , kill ackroyd , and get to the gate by nine oclock ?
nowone wonders .
charles moved his chair an inch or two and looked round the caf in a casual manner .
davenheim left the house ?
you havent had it modernized and redecorated ?
without caring a pin for me , she would have liked me to be continually dancing attendance .
theyre certainly not mrs .
someone ought to have seen how hard it was on me .
celia and i will have the rest and were going to be happy together .
hercule poirot said : you have a young gardener , i noticed , whom i think you must have taken on recently .
with a hoarse cry the young man dropped onto a chair , flung his arms out in front of him on the table , bowing his head on them and muttering : oh !
' but i can ' t !
no fire without smoke .
the terrier had continued to bark in some sequestered spot .
clayton , richard had met some years previously in persia .
the melancholy-faced fournier was looking quite eager and excited .
the black angel , murmured mrs .
whenever george goes away i get better .
said eileen rich .
it was the tomb of the great noble meriptah and her father was the mortuary priest responsible for its upkeep .
sit down here .
i will explain everything .
simply in this way .
the house was very still excuse me , interrupted the superintendent , but can you give me an idea of the time when this occurred ?
its possible , i think , that she also tired of them rather quickly .
a gardener at the embassy , a servant at the consulate , an official at the airport , in the customs , at the railway stationsall hotels watcheda cordon , stretched tight .

thats what nurse hopkins advises .
poor dr .
the man i was trying to present would not have gone into sordid details .
he isnt to blame .
i expect horace will have come round long before that .
she was a good-looking young woman of perhaps nearer thirty than twenty , her looks depending more on skilful grooming than actual features .
or whether shes left .
ah , no , in that matter i take no interest .
i suppose he had no expectations from anyone ?
not the sort of place i would choose myself .
cant go .
good job they made of it , he said under his breath .
the crime passionel !
holmes packed up the manuscript in the small brown bag he carried , wished anthony good morning , and departed .
hercule poirot said : that is what i have been studying ever since i arrived here .
the doctors smile had been that of a grown-up amused by the cleverness of a child .
lord said : whats the good of life , anyway ?
on what local light do we call next ?
jackson on cosmetics _num_ .
of course , major metcalf .
today , her hair , richly blued , was piled upward in a multiplicity of rather artificial little curls in a pseudo marquise style .
i told you so before .
he looked with distaste at the counts exquisitely manicured hands .
actually finding a real clue !
poirot watched me keenly .
too nicely brought up , no doubt !
father , would you please tell monsieur poirot that we no longer have any need of his services ?
sometimes theyre worse than they seem .
this is very sad news , but you will excuse me if i say that i do not see how it bears on the subject of your inquiry ?
there were no children of the marriage , and his wife died after two yearsthe result of a fall downstairs .
in front of him were two figures .
i dont think i passed anyone until i came to the red lion .
a scream .
i wonder some arent had up for libel all the time .
helen saw it the same way as i did .
they were in evening dress ?
dear uncle roly , he always wants to spare me everything , clarissa told the inspector with an enchanting smile .
then she said abruptly : you know my sister .
he turned to hugo , and handed him the stick .
a tragedy of love may not always belong to romeo and juliet , it is not necessarily only the young who suffer the pains of love and are ready to die for love .
we will go and look presently .
neele was trying now , through lance , to get at a closer appreciation of percivals personality .
a first gong was sounded at five minutes past eight .
then you pressed his buzzer , turned on the taps of the wash basin and left the room .
or was it some entirely different reason .
you think they were working together ?
disapproving of a person doesnt keep you from having a pash for them .
the colonel stared at him , damn it , it happened tonight .
you see , sir , i was very fond of the capting andwell , if i could do for you , sir , the same as i did for him , well , it would be almost like the same thing , if you know what i mean .
thats been done hundreds of times .
ill give you a lift .
moreover , she judged that lemoine , under cover of his story , was deliberately striking out his own course across the park .
no matter what he said she remained quite imperturbable .
so i let her go at the month and i gave her a written reference saying she was honest and sober , but privately i warned old mrs .
hell probably grow out of all that .
yes , indeed , im thoroughly fogged , said roberts .
at least a dozenprobably more .
then i went and found stephen .

but i must stop him going to the cloades .
but germany seemed to be so peaceful and well run .
poirot investigates .
poirot asked : do you want to marry charles oldfield ?
you havent asked me yet why i said there was something odd about the picture .
he cast about for something to say , but he could not think of anything .
there is the respectable ellenand her so far unseen husband .
she paused a minute , and added in a different tone : and then i met john cavendish .
i am so glad .
you tell your cook .
went there to meet someone .
they must act at once .
for winnie .
ive no idea who you are .
he was getting obsessed by pip and emma .
i tore the orange envelope open without much interest .
and so the next month sped away .
it was half past six , the rush hour .
she hadnt got elsa greers scornful honestywith caroline every thing was oblique , suggested rather than said .
she would not tolerate for a moment an adopted son who was the son of a famous murderer .
poirot picked it up and put it discreetly on the table .
yes , ive got miss milray .
thats quite ok by me .
were those two on good terms with each other ?
what has kept mrs .
miss murgatroyd arrived at a brisk trot very much out of breath .
wish i had tommy here to talk to .
i dont think it sounds as though im going to be much good to you .
wisley .
she was aware of unwisdom in going on , and yet there were things she badly wanted to say .
so you know that name ?
murder isnt what most people thinkgiving someone a dollop of arsenicpushing them over a cliffthat sort of stuff .
wouldn ' t it be better - ?
there was a ring of small boys and other people standing staring at the house .
parker pyne , what can that have to do with it ?
i sat there quietly waiting .
no lorry .
poirot climbed aboard the train .
he said : its a bit out of focusbut i could swearat any rate im almost sureits the same man .
if it is your wish james kleek was suddenly on his feet .
beware , she cried warningly .
there were also a quantity of letters thrown carelessly into a drawer .
i dont know , said alex petulantly .
oh yes , said miss marple , i quite understand that .
give that to me , gerda , she said .
hubbard , but its bad for you , you know , getting all worked up .
naturally shes never here .
rosalind received all reproaches in silence .
she said : pilar , now , seems so extraordinarily self-possessedi suppose its the spanish blood .

i know it well .
there was a little faint scrubby grass in dark patches here and there and some dry thorn .
if she ' d been blackmailing him .
lets go up and see this bathroom and all the rest of it .
think it silly or not , as you like , theres something giving me the creeps .
i hate my father as much as i hate mary .
josie brought her here .
and i went to the side of the bed , and i touched her hand .
she was a small spare woman with a sharp eye and tight lips .
always the martyr !
i think it was simply splendid of you , said the girl with enthusiasm .
through an opening she looked into a small square courtyard and at the farther side of it an open doorway with the olive branch on a huge sign and a rather impossible looking plaster bird holding an unrecognizable twig in its beak .
married that girl , didnt he ?
the people of alwiyah offered me charming hospitality .
father looked up .
he looked sharply at her and then away again .
up to now he had never come in contact with illness or death .
in spite of the preponderance of elderly pussies and middle-aged females there were , at any rate , two young people among the passengers .
forty women i have with me , said miss wilbraham , and i really must congratulate myself .
i cried with the skittish accent of an elderly dowager .
in the drawer in my room .
what a wonderful novelettish mind you must have behind that legal faade !
paul lopez shrugged elegant shoulders .
shall we say payment of services in advance ?
i practised the piano a few hours a day , and kept it up as well as i could to my former standard , but i took no more lessons .
somebodys been playing a trick on you again , said mrs .
rices astonished and scornful look made him blush .
he puts on sessles well-known blue coat and cap and strides back to the tee .
i felt an immeasurable contempt for him .
general macarthur ?
i dont know what time you arrived basil blake said sullenly : about two in the morning .
yes , we know all about him .
ive done the chambermaids pretty thoroughly !
quite mad , he declared .
she says it is best to take no notice .
it didnt seem very sensible , rubbing it in to a man that his wife owned property all over the world and was fabulously rich .
all that belonged to a past chapter in his life .
summerhayes is a nice lady but she doesnt know the first thing about a house .
you have been paying attentions to the daughter , i understand .
as a matter of fact , that is what takes me down there now .
said victoria and stood up .
the narrowness , the deadly monotony of it , almost drove me mad .
hoffmans voice was suddenly edged .
it is worse than that , he said .
he added , we take a psychology course , you know , in our training .
nevertheless she went to sleep that night with an unpleasant little clutch of fear at her heart .
clearly you have brains , mademoiselle .
so i should be careful not to hurt these spoiled brats ?
neither do i think that she ever suffered one pang of remorse for the three crimes she had committed .
amyas drank it down the way he always drank beer , just pouring it down his throat in one draught .
i never told him that i was his mother .
then presently as he fell silent she asked : ' what are you thinking about ?
a couple of boys , too , but theyre not much good .
it is alive to evil , it can be one of the most evil things there can be .
im taking the most melodramatic examples , said the doctor .
stolen jewellery , the stones removed from their settings , could be taken out of england , illicit stones and drugs brought in .
bobby , have you thought ?
he also began to wash (quite a novelty on his part , since his mother had had to worry him for several years about the state of his hands , neck , etc .
nobody can overhear ; dont be uneasy .
satipy gave a hysterical laugh .
i had a bit more work to do .
a girl called joyce .
went to the sales last week .
now why three women ?
they were unkind to his figure , which ran mostly to stomach .
we never confided anything personal in each other , but whenever we met we had something to discuss , and plenty to talk about .
resonancenaturall periodsif the period of the force coincides with the natural periodthere was something about a suspension bridge , soldiers marching over it and the swing of their stride being the same as the period of the bridge .
justice wargrave and the latter coughed again .
i told you so this morning .
the whole thing is stupid , said miss carnaby with warmth .
i dont remember anything .
i know something about serum therapeutics .
you dont have to follow the heroine up and down the stairs , or out to the tennis lawn and back , thinking thoughts that have to be described .
the fatuous expression of good nature on his face failed for a moment .
it made a bit of drama for him , i think .
he came here looking for norma .
dane calthrop , what do the village peoplei mean the townspeoplesay ?
taken the old lady home all right ?
these girls nowadays .
he fulfils the conditionsthe only person who does .
poirot said sharply , eh bien ?
simply pages .
got something up your sleeve , m .
so it did , agreed julia .
really , miss lytton gore , she looks terrible sometimes .
then , as far as you know , sir gervase had no worries of any kind ?
well , i am interested in you .
i envy you , mr .
over to his right sits a pretty young woman , clearly infatuated with the man opposite .
the kettles boiling , ducks , just make the tea , will you .
craddocks eyes took in the room with a quick , practised glance .
i think you would understand if you knew my circumstances better .
and it is the childs ghost that is supposed to haunt the place ?
snow had fallen all over england for the last four days , and up here on the fringe of dartmoor it had attained a depth of several feet .
oh , shes out , is she ?
did you sir ?
giles reed here .
shed established herself as letitia blacklock .
so please give it to me .
what had occurred should not have occurred .
im afraid you did not quite get my meaning sir .
lady westholme admitted grudgingly that as far as she knew it was .
exactly to the minute , little girl , said sir roderick .
she took janes hand in hers .
if only i hadnt been such an utter foolto go and faint .
macattayes ?
i suppose , she said , youre m .
she said , you remember , that she found the silver table lid open and closed it down in passing .
all that gin yesterday , perhaps .
according to her adele had then been in perfect health and had just been pouring herself out a last cup of tea .
' you do not mind , mademoiselle , if i ask you a few questions ?
i was very careful not to hint or remind her in any way of what she had told me .
and yet , you know , i rather like the chap .
it was soon evident that the fascinating jeanne had completely enslaved his heart .
one i think was a foreign refugee and the other was some american child .
i had fixed up for him to give me a weekly overhaul .
and he says whos mr clayton ?
have you any ideais there anything you can tell me to help me find outwho killed mary gerrard ?
and soand so hes waited until he got the boy alone and then drowned him in the brook so that he shouldnt speak , so that he shouldnt tell .
well , we have .
thats to say if she herself is the criminal .
let us see if i can reach it .
' i looked sideways at him .
he strode over to her , and jerked her on to her feet with a hand on her shoulder .
leaning back with her head against a cushion she felt tired and vaguely depressed .
fortescues personal secretary should be sent in to him .
a comparison of the two stones would be interesting .
the police could arrest you just the same , i pointed out .
i care intensely .
she was all alone .
but come , do sit down .
you told me the truth .
i did , as a matter of fact .
comes over them like a kind of disease .
miss dinsmead , said mortimer , gently , have you ever had any reason to believe that you are mediumistic ?
they can take an interest in their husbands and in the local affairs and in the gossip thats going round , and of course in their children .
going all out he was to try and make things goand just as nervous as a cat on wiresbut all he could do didnt seem to cut any ice .
youre sure , mrs bartlett ?
race followed her .
but i thoughtwe all thoughtthat miss vansittart .
shell be round in a minute .
he had always been so quiet , so interested in serious subjects .
not a simple , sordid crime , but drama .
superintendent battle looked round at poirot .
but there would have to be a third character , the maid in the garden hanging up the clothesand i suppose that suggested the whole wicked plan to him .
a lot of it could , of course , be discounted .
and now , said poirot , we come to this business of patricias ring .
soon you must make his acquaintance .
a little later , to make all safe , concrete over the ground where the body lies , and , on the concrete , erect a folly he added gently : sir georges follythe folly of the owner of nasse house .
sir stafford was not taken aback .
well , it doesnt surprise me in the least .
oh , yes .
right you are , nurse .
he replied blandly .
he took it from her and sharpened it .
address , please , he mumbled , drawing his notebook towards him .
no , im afraid not , madam .
see here , folks .
here everything was in wild confusion .
she said coldly : i can assure you i never take cold .
here i scream , said poirot helpfully .
yes , curse him .
suddenly she stopped .
a very fine school it was , too .
ralph may be extravagant , but hes a dear boy , and has the nicest manners .
and when my father would have associated me with him in partnership , together with my elder brothers , it was sobek who persuaded him not to do so .
ii the second incident was mr .
so , as far as you know , he had no enemies , and you can give us no clue as to any secret to obtain possession of which he might have been murdered ?
turning off the main road , the two men passed into the comparative quiet of a mews .
jane wilkinsons careless suggestion that geraldine might have killed her father seemed to me particularly absurd .
you dont remember if you were sitting or standing ?
at gossington ?
its doncaster the a b c murders going to be .
and he was the first to get up .
he held out a dirty piece of cardboard for her inspection .
the pistol falls at his feet .
must have been getting on for forty .
i now proceeded to ring up the sunday school teachers , who were coming at _num_ : _num_ for their weekly preparation class .
yes , yes , the pince-nez , the telephone call , the short woman who called for the gold box in paris .
well , i suppose if youre going to find them , youll have to ask , wont you ?
did she care , or did she not ?
it was proved false by one set of people .
we both liked her .
willett with determination , id soon have got over all that nonsense .
here it is , sir , he said , but i doubt if it will be any good .
is that what she did ?
conrad , clearly , but a member of her own family , her husband or son .
her feet moved noiselessly over the ground .
i always use a solution of nicotine for spraying roses .
she picked up the racquet jennifer had dropped .
miss marple was saying this evening that that note was all wrong .
the sort of girl who would expect you to tell her every morning at the breakfast table that you loved her passionately !
bess sedgwick sat up sharply in her chair .
i just wondered , thats all .
after all , the issue is very simple .
i can now attend to the other little matter .
as i said before , my father and her mother were brother and sister , just as you might betommy did not correct this view of their relationshipbut they didnt always get on together .
that and the clock together will make the inspector suspicious of me for life .
some of beatrices rigidity returned .
a most picturesque spot , he said , quite out of the world , and at the same time very comfortable and most exclusive in every way .
you may not know that my sister-in-law , lady clarke , is in very bad health .
of course they are .
everyone looked startled and uncomfortable .
cade , said virginia softly .
after all , its the only sensible way of getting to this place .
i swear , messieurs , that i saw nothing very wrong in that .
alfred lee was turning out to be such a sensible and competent woman .
oliver , to whom politics had always been anathema .
i like to thinkoh , it seems a silly thing for me to say she looked doubtfully at hercule poirot .
not the sort of thing shed think of or bother about .
but there is such a thing as a run of bad luck .
i myself remained in the underground resistance , and after the war ended i had certain assignments .
he sent for you to come from spain .
he turned them gently .
what idiots girls are !
if you hit on exactly the right spot it kills a man instantaneously .
what about the medical evidence as to state of mind , etcetera ?
granite bungalow , said the old man reflectively , it be granite bungalow you do want ?
the disappearance of the famous financier took on a totally different aspect in the light of the revelation of the financial affairs of the bank .
im afraid , said miss marple , that we have all to face the fact that conditions are different .
but ive still a word to say .
yes , well it went further than that now .
jessop went on .
charles , charming though he was , was not to be trusted .
i remember the uralia .
never mind jimmy .
what they call a first-class financial brain .
life went on peacefully at kings gnaton for five months and then the blow fell .
either mademoiselle jane or myself might recognize in anne morisot the madeleine who had been lady horburys maid .
hillingdon , but miss marple said firmly that they were both young women who liked enjoying themselves and that she herself preferred a light meal early and so that would suit everybody .
roger leonides was standing up by the window .
you seem very positive , said anthony , turning to look at her .
why dr .
lots of people dont know about cork trees , he said confidentially .
hes a dangerous lunatic , said mildred sharply .
the secretary left the room with the air of a determined man , and hastings approached poirot in great excitement .
dupont , jane found as charming as his son , but she got little chance of talking to him .
her first idea , as i say , went on miss marple , would be to deny it all .
safe in the shadow of his own door , he watched the other pass and regain his own room .
no , because i am in doubt upon one point .
he was struck suddenly with her intense and passionate beauty .
first of all , doctor , perhaps youll give me your full name and address .
it is not that i do not attend ; i attend very carefully , i assure you .
and i should say that what he calls a big deal is a big deal .
swettenham and edmund , and phillipa haymes , and colonel easterbrook and mrs .
larger than i ever handled , my lady , said alfred with simple candour .
when the fellow wants to use it , he soaks a button in water .
alfred , of course , will get the larger share .
antoine agreed to janes demands .
thats one of the things i wanted to say to you .
i said your wife .
having some grains of intelligence , i strongly suspect that my beautiful alibi has bust .
your bedroom is prepared .
keeping a stiff upper lip !
thats a better one , said virginia approvingly .
i should say the reason was rex fortescue himself .
he wanted to send her away , and i said she was a dear girl , and i would not have it .
during the evening did you leave the train at all ?
he displayed keen interest and curiosity .
its never difficult to think of things , said mrs .
i beg your pardon , mr .
youre in love with the girl , said macmaster .
poirot , rather maliciously , i thought , assigned me the outside place as i had the mania for the fresh air and himself occupied the seat next to our fair neighbour .
asked miss bennett .
alas , a mere heritage , said poirot unblushingly .
i have accepted the commission .
never had such a shock in my life .
if you like to send your police doctor to see me , id be willing to give him my views .
personally i do not think so .
lawrence blushed , and then smiled awkwardly .
out of revenge ?
willett herself took a seat .
leading me on !
he dare not risk having it found on him when i arrived .
for the more active side of the campaign i shall have with me my invaluable hastings .
good man .
i guess you havent heard , he said to their welcoming host .
you have to memorize what you drink with certain foods .
plausible , yes .
they drove away from the station , over the railway bridge and down a country road which presently disclosed a very beautiful river view .
whats the matter , valerie ?
he was walking along with his head down as though he were searching for something .
doesnt seem likely to me , said johnson .
deftly he replaced the gag and went out .
bryan martin washow do you sayturned down ?
i think you know , lady horbury , just exactly what the evidence consists of .
percival switched his attention to neele .
she cried half angrily : tony !
but not the borgia goblet ?
and there i was on a roof in dublin and who should i see coming down the street but my brother and i there with a rifle in my hand .
he then asked if i happened to know a house called trearne down there .
theyll have the police after them if they do .
also , there is the frightening thought that you may be discouraging someone who ought not to be discouraged .
class distinctions in those days were very strong .
no fortitude !
what do i care for the diamond ?
not at this tide .
that squirrel will be off up the chimney one of these days !
what youve done with that stone beats me .
what i meant was that we had gone through that door into the library .
look here , gina , i came to meet miss marple .
he changed his name and came back to england .
looks rattled .
mocking me !
it was nothing , really .
he knows something about dr .
we had a bit of a windfall a year ago .
tommy blinked a little and coughed as he took in the scene in front of him .
but we were wrong there was a third person at the flat that evening who had an equally good opportunity to do so .
yes , the burglary idea was all a put-up job .
that case has got glass in it .
im sure shes frightfully clever .
if the beggars got anything to say , why doesnt he say it ?
lucy and emma retired .
youll see it marked up on the door .
even if he hasnt made a mistake , it wont matterso long as the right person killed him .
she said : wont you take me with you ?
ill put it plainly .
i think it was simpler than that .
at last i have an idea .
but after a while they stopped talking about her and discussed instead who was going to win the grand national .
nadine boynton seemed pleased , but very much surprised .
nowadays i often feel that it is for ones own prestige that one wants ones children to succeed .
clotilde and anthea bradbury-scott , but because she had always been very devoted to elizabeth templeand elizabeth temple had had great influence over herit seems to me that she would have written and given her information of some kind .
bills voice chimed in suddenly with singular appropriateness .
all the gaiety of the clown was gone .
upward , though she was clearly very fond of robin , nevertheless unconsciously treated him as a prized possession that she had bought and paid for .
that can easily be remedied , said lady caterham briskly .
i didnt notice particularly .
could they make me dream that dream night after night ?
as good a time as any to do what he had set out to do mrs .
then there are the lawyers who drew it upelford and leigha very respectable firm as mr .
was hehe cant have been strangled ?
she was sometimes spoken of as ellen terrys successor .
agatha christie poirot hercule poirots christmas .
miss gilchrist murmured , im so sorry youve had to come down again , mrs .
no , i do not say it is so , but it might be .
yahmose turned his head with difficulty on the curved , wooden headrest .
this visitor proved to be of an entirely different type to the last .
hori said gently : yes , yahmose .
theres a difference .
they would understand the danger to themselves far too well !
all along , he said , i have been worried over the why of this case .
she thinks as you dothat theres somethingodd about it ?
shot again ?
they may happen to anyone .
robinson might be able to clear up a mystery that my wife and i found connected with it , relating to a long time back .
took care of an old lady , seemed really fond of her .
an old friend of yours , i believe , said poirot politely to lady millicent .
he looked very hard at jane .
that is all clear enough .
it is quite certain that he could not have left it after committing the crime ?
she dropped her hands with a gesture of despair .
it was just that i heard smethurst say to hensley , you cant deny that there is a leakage in your department .
its a long time ago , you know .
weyman for youwhichever you want to see first .
and it was then that he remarked , what on earth hullo , tommy , said tuppence , youre back a bit earlier than i thought you would be .
that reminds mefellow i met out at monte had some kind of relation coming here .
the gold box found in miss adams bag had the initial d in it .
if youre a pensioner you get a ticket for it and you go there and you have bingo and you have all sorts of things there .
meredith blake as to the order in which the five people left this room on that dayfor it seemed to me hardly conceivable that anyone should be able to help themselves to the poison whilst five people were in the room .
someone , i think , who appears once and once only .
madame exe will understand .
there was only one possible hiding place in it , the tall wardrobe , and he looked into that immediately .
he used to pay the first term with every sign of affluence and then depart and leave me on the nuns hands for a year or two .
no , it didnt seem to be .
she was proposing , as this letter shows , to make trouble .
behind mr .
we were all up there .
he said : theres another thing we must go into , the pipe question .
we do not speak the truth any longer .
he was fond of midge .
envy , revenge , jealousy , fear , money ?
joan .
i think of your great west road in london .
she certainly may .
you would have to bring evidence to that effect , said the lawyer sharply .
there was nothing mucha handkerchief , keys , notecase filled with notes , and some unimportant letters .
or possibly in rompers !
hester turned her head and looked up .
mrs waverly looked at him reproachfully .
i dont know how he knewi hadnt told him .
bad judgement and bad luck .
yours may bemine are not !
he didnt want a divorce , either .
im suggesting that christopher wren is an old friend , that youre on rather closer terms with him than youd like me to know .
who could she have seen murdered ?
to him i said what i had been told to say : that poirot had discovered something rather interesting which he thought mr .
i thought that they were going to play a joke on you , m .
satterthwaite went downstairs rather disappointed .
the whole eastern sky was a riot of rose and orange and pale , pearly grey .
one never does know with her .
betoun evans , he is english adviser therevery nice man .
why , we had one only last year , or was it the year before last ?
magdalene was there , standing by the hall table with a little parcel in her hand .
nevertheless i realized that this was not the usual kind of thing we had gone through before .
you see , maam , its the way it happenedthe way miss skinner looked .
circle of people , chauffeurs , their wives , errand boys , loafers , : well-dressed passers-by and innumerable children were drawn up all staring at no .
hautet , acknowledging the young mans bow .
the home office expert gave his evidence ; the maid jessie poured out a flood of voluble information , most of which was rejected , but which certainly strengthened the case against the prisoner .
passons !
which cook ?
the countess suddenly dropped her jesting manner .
things he had sent home from abroad when he was a young man .
it is awkwardyes , agreed poirot .
as they went downstairs together , battle glanced at the list in his hand .
i was just going to say you were looking wonderfully well , my dear .
an absolute fool .
such cases had occurred in recent newspaper reports .
i might dine with you tomorrow night .
pleased with himself by all accounts .
i think im rather too tired to go on now .
then i met you two on the stairs coming down .
well , naturally i went out of the house , stood on the steps and then i walked round to the back garden .
father was a great one for the boats always , said mrs .
cried george lomax .
he turned up about a year ago , and weve seen him on and off since .
if you promise to do that and not think you can walk everywhere i know , i know , said his patient , interrupting him .
miss marple paid off the taxi in a careful assortment of small change , and rang the front doorbell .
restarick shook his head very definitely .
i never dreamed that mrs .
those three taps on the window ?
he was aware of a pair of very shrewd grey eyes watching him out of the small wizened face .
you wicked woman !
the giddiness was passing .
already his limbs felt cramped and stiff .
anything but that .
a very simple onesome shredded raw vegetables , brown bread and butter , fruit .
well , thats been called off .
curious story , the whole thing .
it was as though miss wills were painstakingly learning him by heart .
that is to say , gain in its various ramifications .
it was neither more nor less than the deliberate poisoning of a fond and trusting woman by the stepson to whom she had been more than a mother .
major blunt hasnt looked at it yet , objected the inspector .
at quarter to six trouble beginlarge english ladyvery grand ladycome back and want tea although boys are now laying dinner .
shes been seriously ill the last year or two , you know .
even now i cannot say .
i forgot she was in gear .
luke makes a beginning _num_ .
and susan said , any more theories ?
we neednt bother you any further , mrs .
he wouldnt like her inheriting money under false pretences .
it is still a mystery , madame .
she went straight into her own room which leads off the kitchen and went to bed .
and at last people began to notice .
he held it aloft .
tell me , did you enjoy your visit with mrs .
victoria looked at her .
his passport was found by the proprietor of a small restaurant in boulogne , who handed it in to the police .
whichever you like .
does one drink it ?
i am the soul of politeness .
the inspector took a few steps around the room , his eyes on the floor as though deep in thought .
she gave me one or twopresents .
im the horrible corpse , she said .
i cried and cried and cried .
ill fight like anything to stop it , but dont credit me with moral indignation .
i ought to know , but i dont .
mind you , this isnt , at the present moment of talking , a good offer .
redall red .
peace and good will towards men ?
they didnt recognize it .
do sit down , inspector .
about your brother , she said .
he shrank back a little .
five and twenty past fiveoh my god , then it was true after all .
chapter _num_ stunned silence followed hercule poirots statement .
it was always the same things over and over again .
he said : sit down , mademoiselle .
she was over there behind the door , where inspector craddock is now .
she gestured towards the desk .
' the quiet sympathy of his tone seemed to break down jane plenderleith ' s defences .
trouble is nowadays they wont look twice at a nice hardworking lad .
agatha christie poirot the clocks .
shes staying there under the name of mrs .
so far so good , but after this came the snag .
husband and wifedevoted to each other !
lorrimers final word .
from thence we can come directly to the _num_ rd may .
at least thats what she says .
it is what you think that matters .
after all , she laid her hand on his arm , however little our marriage means , it should at least mean sharing our difficulties .
rather an exciting weekend , isnt it ?
satterthwaite draw her out on the point .
timothy , coming back , standing a moment , looking at the table with a slightly puzzled eye , then going to where the meerschaum pipe rested against the pale blue cup .
i turned the pages of my book .
nevertheless she continued gentle suggestion .
murmured m .
firmly and immediately she sat down on a dustbin which was against the wall quite close to her .
inspector neele said thoughtfully : it wasnt really a very nice afternoon for walking , especially after dark in a muddy lane .
this takes me back years , hugo recalled .
she had borne her own long illness , she had borne nigels defection and the cruel and brutal circumstances in which it had operated .
as it happened , i did appear in print at the age of eleven .
suddenly his manner changed back again .
after all , its my library , isnt it ?
miss hartnell is very good at pouncing in a heavy and cumbrous way .
rosamund said : i think its really very simple .
as for the rest of what you say , surely that is my business !
the portrait ?
she murmured to herself .
it ran as follows : dear m .
then the home office might have ordered exhumation .
of course , we wont let him see we suspect .
he led the way down the stairs , talking as he went .
she must go ahead .
poirot said : on the contraryi understand very well .
we are not ruined .
my head , it aches abominably .
scuttle filed this away rapidly as though for future reference .
ive never seen him lose his temper over losing a match .
no , i had never seen the lady until i met her here .
many different kinds of authors .
well , i should think they are always prepared for various eventualities and have a plan for dealing with them .
poirot , to tumble to that .
he is , of course , of a different political colour from the conservative lady westholme , and intends to oppose her as an independent candidate at the next by-elections .
you oughtnt to be here at all , said the nurse .
im so sorry youre goingso soon , laura told him , with genuine feeling in her voice .
charlton , he meant to make ample provision for pilar in a new will .
george crossfield said , the white dints showing once more each side of his nose , who sent you here ?
ive been so sorry to hear of a lot of things like that in the past .
shes just as likely to have done it as anyone else , so far as i can seemore likely .
he saw the boys eyes meet hers .
and whoever did it , deliberately put the hands of the watch back to nine-ten .
the croupier swept away the stakes , paid out .
but all along i realized that in that case elinor must have been the intended victim , not mary .
a big fire burned in the grate , and a chintz-covered sofa stood at one side of it .
well , that was how she was leaving itin the possession of two loversone dead and one who suffered and lived she went out through the door to where tommy and the car were waiting .
youd say he was going to cut your throat any moment .
taverner said smoothly : we dont think it was a joke , mrs .
a man wanted by the police , perhaps , or a man whos already married , or some bad character in the underworld .
packington felt amusedly mistress of the situation .
she shivered , looked around at everyone , and continued , besides , i thought it might be true .
my uncle quite so , said george sympathetically .
this house is practically falling to pieces .
practically the whole lot of them .
i suppose i must have left it in my room .
but the wylde case had been different .
if the tramp was georges conneau , it was after the stormy interview with him that mr .
attention returned to mr .
that is what i have been wondering .
everyone thought it was lettice .
said tommy reasonably .
said her husband , slightly surprised .
peters , like herself , had at once hated and feared the atmosphere of the unit .
lord dittisham paused .
asked garroway .
he must provide a home and the wherewithal to feed , clothe and look after his wife .
captain marshall , mr .
we can verify that , anyway , said frankie .
looking at my early photographs , one , taken before i came out , with two long pigtails , sitting , for god knows what reason , at a spinning-wheel , is quite attractive .
your master , then , does the same .
the mother renounced all rights in it .
yes , i said , with some pleasure .
ruths face lightened .
im glad im cleared from suspicion , laughed raymond .
whispered the girl .
on the train coming here from kantara .
the doctor said sharply : did she take things to make her sleep ?
sorry to be so unhelpful .
i had no thought of miss russell in my mind at that time .
hit me bang between the eyes .
caroline had to admit that she didnt know .
poirot said sadly : i warned her .
i expect shes in the drawing room with mrs .
of course it was all a big thrill at the time .
beresford , every single day word goes round that one , two , three , four , up to a hundred parachutists have been seen !
he had been a grave , silent young man when she went away , with sensitive , clever fingers .
thank god for racing !
hensley , sirso thats no good .
if it is necessary for a criminal to be a consummate actress , then by all means assume her to be one .
no , it must be a dream , a hallucination perhaps .
only my granddaughter sophia seems to me to have the positive qualities required .
we actually have two quite different sets of bedrooms .
you see , slack ?
and there were other reasons .
james reilly had been apprehended , and was in custody .
his eyes were alight with the fierceness of one who sees an enemy .
she very kindly came here to give us what information she could about the girl gladys .
suspicious circumstances : none .
lynn said : come along , rowley .
remember the price of failure .
i mean , a fellows so helpless .
whilst he ate , he read a morning paper propped up in front of him .
shes due in a quarter of an hour , said mr .
you are still preoccupied with this girl who inherits ?
the poor fellow seems very upset , said the vicar .
i mean , its nothing to do with you and i dont think its the sort of thing youd even be interested in .
will you send miss magdalen to me .
) scarf cut in pieces (valeries) trousers (colins) cookery book ( ?
then you never suspected norton kane ?
hercule poirot made a significant gesture .
i wonder how it could have happened .
what does the young siegfried do ?
she was excited herself last night because she was leaving .
cloade frowned a little , then he said hesitatingly : ive no experience , of course , of police cases .
yes , i passed it yesterday , i think .
fanthorp explained how he had gone back to search for it , but had not been able to find it .
in any case , he added , poor edgar certainly did not shoot gulbrandsen .
a man jumped on the step .
you are clear in your mind that the woman was definitely preparing to jump over the cliff ?
by the corner of them lay a young man .
there had come the sound of the bell below .
and not true , because when i write it , it does !
amberiotis , it was committed at any time between twelve and five-and-twenty past .
lance said firmly : where youre concerned , pat , im taking no risks .
he was staring down at her with a puzzled face , then shook his head .
silly old benny !
back at the ritz , tommy packed up his few belongings mechanically , his thoughts far away .
a great invalid , hardly moved out of his cabin .
if he had disposed of secret information he would be liable , she supposed , to prosecution under the official secrets actthat , no doubt , was what peters was hinting at in his rather embarrassed waybut hilary was clear in her own mind .
iiwell , i would have agreed to do any mortal thing she liked .
ever heard of landslides ?
he smiled ; his beautiful dark eyes , so melancholy , so romantic , looked tenderly into hers .
the small garden round it was spick and span , the window frames and sashes had been lately painted and there were clean bright curtains at the windows .
this is going to be a wonderful day .
i was a damned fool , said peter lord .
on the day after mr .
to begin with , i must mention a few things about myself .
i will say no more , said mosgorovsky .
you knew that she recently threw herself out of a window in this block of flats ?
' i ' m not a patient , doctor , ' said hercule poirot .
i was to see miss marple again that afternoon , however .
its a pity all young people are prigs !
that is exactly what i did fear .
that man-in-the-backgrounds a myth .
now that is a nice thought , said luke .
that seems to be the idea , said father .
of course we shall know , dear , said miss marple briskly .
she didnt return .
and michael weyman , hes an architect staying here in the house to design a tennis pavilion .
well , its fiddlesticks to say she was in the house .
i make a point of never giving in to my bodily needs .
i myself , she added , think he has been educated at the dogs open university .
and again , after a period of years she appeared to be completely sane , left the establishment , lived in an ordinary life with a very pleasant nurse more or less in charge of her , though considered in the household as a ladys maid .
my name is amory , claud amory i have heard of you , of course , sir claud , poirot responded .
' somethitg in that maybe ?
of course , he had emphasized the softness in the hopes that it would be too soft to be heard outside the room .
you know when she more or less fell out of the window .
in my own apartment i will consume some brioches and some chocolate clairs (so called) which i had the foresight to buy at a confectioners .
it doesnt please me , i can tell you !
after all , we have established the identity of number two and number three , and we have learnt more than a little about the ways and methods of number four .
theres nothing funny about a proposal .
sir henry clithering , of course , said miss marple , is a very old friend of mine .
we had to have the doctor , and the doctor gave him a sedative .
there was no clue to her identity , or as to her whereabouts .
what do you mean by that , renata ?
think he might have been taken bad ?
i expect im mad , said mrs .
you see , it was as sudden as all that .
i suppose you clever men who are at the top of things never get a real rest .
she went down to the kitchen and put the kettle on .
she came down about eleven and looked hopefully for someone who might have time to read the papers to her .
i took my thoughts away from her .
her left hand was pressed to her side , as though to still the sudden unconquerable agitation of her heart .
we hardly dared approach katharine in the morning , but she behaved in the most katharine-like manner .
he had patted her shoulder : yes , he said .
it is not as though you were accusing her .
young bleibner was suffering from some minor skin trouble ; he had lived in the south sea islands , where the disease is common enough .
i am not a private detective .
i tell you im afraid of that other lifeit nearly rotted me through once .
the question is , how much attention to pay that belief of hers , he said .
he turned to his wife .
he taught me a lot .
would you like to speak to them while youre here ?
tuppence nodded and pored over the two photographs .
youd better tell me the real story .
an invalid french lad , m .
lady tressilian sighed .
she ought to be , perhaps , but she will not be !
it was brought to her as ifno , not as though she were a queenas though she were a middle-aged lady staying in a good but not unduly expensive hotel .
archie discouraged that , because he said it spoilt his weekends .
thats miss moya in her court dress .
we havent any servants , said molly .
aunt laura meant it to , too .
sir gervase jealous ?
efficiency always makes itself felt .
she thinks he supplies henry with the drugbut thats pure conjecture , shes not a particle of evidence that he does so .
you comprehendi am going to speak to you quite frankly .
royston wasnt on the telephone then .
because he was a newcomer , perhaps ?
i am going to see jims aunt jennifer .
who is the murderer ?
good heavens .
i pointed this out to my friend when we were back in our rooms .
oh , god , i shall go mad myself yes , its armstrong hes watching me now .
did a third person enter that house and kill lord edgware ?
might be , said japp .
the square , solid bulk of superintendent spence rose from the table in one corner .
its about that notethe one mrs .
it just happened , and so really it was fate and not myself .
he had never seen charles lester .
of several other girls in the neighbourhood whod fallen victims to violence , or sexual assault .
albert said , oh , i didnt let them come into the house .
time went on , things got almost straight , and at last i could look forward to the end of my drudgery .
' ' she never mentioned any enemies ?
i must admit that i went to bed with a slight feeling of deflation .
have done for the past six years .
guess thats the only way to tackle the job .
the maid who opened the door looked excited and flushed .
we can quite imagine it , mr .
we walked on in silence for a moment or two , then megan said in a rather shy voice : you fly , dont you ?
thats not our business .
its valuable .
a brilliant idea struck him .
i suppose , she said , again to herself and not to maria , who had had to return rather hurriedly to the kitchen , summoned by a smell of overflowing jam which she happened to have on the stove , i wanted to see what it felt like .
said esa , peering at them with her usual ironical expression .
only to someone of discretion like yourself would i reveal the fact .
but i did know .
the other man joined in .
what a horrid idea .
you know , the royal clarence .
after tea i came back in here with miss vaughan .
sir rowland began to speak , but , hearing the voices of jeremy and miss peake exchanging greetings at the front door , he made a gesture indicating not now .
various ideas flashed chaotically through his mindconfused reflectionsthe photographthat girls face with the wide-apart eyes and the misty hairand ten or fifteen years later mrs .
something to do with the flowers .
immoral earnings and all that sort of thing .
i will show you how admirably the old guard can listen .
and with that she walks along and opens the door and goes in and shuts it behind her .
things dont get me down .
rather an unusual kind of name .
miss waynflete was fussing a little in a gentle spinsterish manner .
why does madame amory want me to go ?
that we got him in the end was solely through mr .
oh lord !
then suddenly her forehead cleared .
he said : you will pardon me , but it seems an obsession with youthis persistent harping on mr .
do you want several things ?
werent you saying something about there being a priests hole in that room ?
youve always stuck to that , jane .
he might , perhaps , have passed the first small paragraph by without interest if it had not been for the recent visit of mrs .
and now , gentlemen , to business .
she seemed in a particularly good humour .
watch and pray .
patterson .
miss burgess gave herself up to calculation .
he started violently .
a story of the most romantic .
it smelt of furniture polish and brasso and contained a large jacobean suite , a round table , two potted geraniums , an elaborate brass fender , and a large variety of china ornaments .
her part was very necessary .
and then , mon ami , she did .
nurse hopkins said in pleased surprise : well , i must say , miss carlisle , thats extremely thoughtful of you .
the change in george !
thats rightyes , so , aim like this .
lydia soon showed them !
uncle claud wasnt good to us at all .
could the arsenic have got into something by accident ?
it was in that way that i met my present husband .
inglethorp , you are standing in very grave danger .
does your stepmother know the man who lives there ?
oh , no , its something in the chemical line .
mother and nursie stood on the end of the pier , gazing after us like figures in a greek play , nursie almost weeping as she prophesied doom , my mother seeking to allay her fears , adding finally , probably remembering what a bad sailor she herself was , i dont expect shell ever want to go again .
poirot questioned race with a glance , and the latter gave a slight nod of assent .
i am not in the least uneasy , said lady astwell .
got the handcuffs handy , fletcher ?
race asked .
i will just say this .
was anyone else after those concessions ?
theres a young man with her , said mr .
the strangers attack was meant to assure my confidence in her .
he upbraided jane as a complete imbcile .
wellfinding out about the photographthat there was only one , not two .
doesnt like the inside of houses .
miss marple leaned forward eagerly .
he was thinking of getting up to investigate but when he sat up in bed his headache began again so he lay down .
he said : yes , yes , major barry .
then , with a sudden stern effort , he focused his gaze once more upon the typewriter before him .
been to a good school .
or possibly norton or miss cole might be a distant relative and would inherit automatically .
but your real name is evelyn hope , isnt it , mr .
i am not so sure !
where did he meet her ?
yes , it is all quite possible .
the score was three all in the final set .
raymond nodded .
i see , said spence .
betterton pushed his hair back nervously from his forehead .
the colour surged suddenly into the girls face .
eight a dead man on that same thursday afternoon virginia revel had been playing tennis at ranelagh .
the old lady had a passion for birds and entertained a feathered gathering to meals every day .
thats the way you get chaps , you know .
paravicini much .
she has been our faithful friend for so long , said leo .
damned becoming that yashmak thing .
supposing i tell you that the forgery you have been so busy talking about wasnt a forgery at all .
take your shoes off , said mrs .
clothes cheap and striking , remarked tuppence .
but in all these theories we seem to be overlooking one essential fact , he remarked .
after completing an elaborate outdoor toilet , we set off for netherall road .
there was a moments silence , and then a thin official voice , with the bloodless impersonality of bureaucracy said : these facts will be put forthwith before the president of the united states of america and the premier of the union of soviet socialist republics .
i looked guiltily at the ground .
thats my handwriting .
its very hard to say , i know .
but the disorder in the room !
anns doing her work for her a levels upstairs and leopolds in the garden assembling a model aeroplane .
it doesnt explain the flight of the butler .
it meandered on , winding to left and to right .
otterbourne in her turban ?
you know who he is ?
she caught her breath , looked sideways at georgeat sugden , then appealingly at colonel johnson .
what other relatives has miss blake got ?
she thought again , but once more shook her head .
its my idea of the dead sea .
my goodnessnot that chap ?
elsie made her decision .
how much did he really know about you ?
so you see , proceeded hardcastle in a smooth voice , if that wound made a scar only five or six years ago , it means that if the man was your husband he had no scar at the time when he left you in _num_ .
theres a lot being done in the way of scientific investigation into snake bite .
marvellous , isnt she ?
who get through ?
its difficult to explain .
well give it all away if you likeendow homes for children , or provide free tobacco for old men , orhow about a campaign for serving better coffee all over england ?
i recognized it , didnt i ?
poor cora .
and to solve that will be difficultsince the criminal , in his wisdom , has been content to avail himself of the devices prepared by renauld .
poirot regarded him searchingly for a moment , and then nodded his head as if satisfied .
she herself was returning from the south of france .
my cogitations were interrupted by the arrival of the train , and in another moment i was greeting poirot .
i shall manage , she said .
this time he did come to england .
so you think the gardener might have killed them ?
miss bellas husband , the foreign doctor , he went out and got her a bottle of something , but although she thanked him very politely she poured it away and that i know for a fact !
devereux and mr .
i dont mind confessing that though mrs boynton is certainly a most remarkable womani greatly admire her pluck in being determined to come hereit does certainly complicate matters travelling with her .
you are maybe acquainted with the cinderella fairy story .
that is so important .
or a faith healer , perhaps ?
ill ask miss brewis .
dinner was at seven-thirty and most of the students were already seated when mrs .
you remember in the case of armstrong , anyone who had in any way offended him or insulted him , or indeed , if he even thought anyone had insulted him , that person was quickly asked to tea and given arsenic sandwiches .
that inspector must be a perfect fool .
they genuinely thought men were splendid fellowsdashing , inclined to be wicked , easily led astray .
father opened his mouth , then shut it again .
perhaps poirots face expressed rather too eloquently what he thought , for mrs .
tressilian had served coffee .
on the contrary , it was opened by one of the handsomest young men i have ever seen .
sheep , said dinah .
hed looked at his commanding officer very oddly .
no , he repeated .
yes , inspector neele ?
so you do recognize him , mr .
you want to look after the bulls , and you do not like going with yahmose or seeing to the cultivating ?
the girl flushed and bit her lip .
occasionally his glance shifted to the view over the plantations .
washing soda .
a big awkward-looking man with red hair entered .
in retaliation , as we walked up the hill , which was , bordered on either side with italianate villas , my nephew , who , at that age , never stopped talking for a moment , would proceed with a kind of gregorian chant of his own , which consisted of repeating the names of all the houses we passed : lanka , pentreave , the elms , villa marguerita , hartly st .
she swayed , but then recovered herself .
do you think that when you get there you can get rid of that footman fellow ?
greater publicity could be ensured by sending the letters to scotland yard .
it is not just anyone .
i believe thats one of the reasons he let sittaford house to this south african lady .
but it is interesting , that .
well , do your best , battle , do your best .
everyone says theyre very devoted to each other , said miss marple .
i feared it , she replied simply .
if they are conscious of weakness , of inefficiency , they make an imposing door of self-assertion , of bluster , of overwhelming authorityand , after a time , they get to believe in it themselves .
asked miss marple , with some interest .
she might herself be unaware of their value .
he had a large library of books , philosophy and otherwise , and was , i think , a remarkable young man .
i mean , you can do anythingyouve only got to get a man as second-in-command who knows a bit about it , and read it up a bit , and there you are !
why wasnt she in bed and asleep ?
the cradle of the race was in africa .
im playing it in the wrong key , i believe , said tuppence , but at any rate , the pianos all right again now .
the only place i could get was berth no .
barnes rose to his feet .
yes , i can see its a more difficult problem than i thought .
satterthwaite nearly knocked his coffee cup off the table .
he neednt have rung the bell , said huish .
oh , nothank you , rowleyid best be getting home .
a report has just come in that the body of a young woman was discovered this morning at seven-fifteen iv miss marples telephone rang when she was dressing .
i borrowed his name for the occasion , knowing that you would not refuse to accompany such a celebrated client .
where did anthony gascoigne live ?
i do not of course know it of my own knowledge .
but vera clung to him .
certainly lord windlesham seemed very pris !
local prejudice !
she scuttles , just like a crab .
how silly to put no surname .
yes , said kelsey , looking at her curiously , yes , thats it .
she looks on and laughs .
it certainly makes things easier for us .
of course i authorize you .
one has to take into account the new modes of thought , said sir george packham .
ive got to .
it was almost a shout .
speaking as an aviator myself , said no _num_ , the thing is perfectly feasible .
in the bedrooms , yes , certainly .
rather a triumph for blunts brilliant detectives , said tommy to tuppence , as they emerged into the street together .
then she did say something ?
nobody has told me .
anthony .
i congratulate you , mrs .
half of them or even more than half were disguised advertisements or offers of things for sale or wanted for sale .
aloud she said : well , it would be quite fun to have a job at the olive branch .
the place was therebut the person wasnt .
do you think it would be possible for you to help us in any way ?
and yet , mademoiselle , this time your manner is quite different .
she has observed his infatuation for mrs vanderlyn .
what they call the upper classes , i mean .
early tea , sir .
but if hes dying .
he might have looked pathetic and dignified .
you told me , did you not , that to play a malicious joke on amyas crale you pinched some of what you called the cat stuffthat is how you put it meredith blake said sharply : valerian !
i should say at least half an hour .
was the appointed hour .
how often must i tell you that clues come from ithin ?
dont worry , rosaleen .
youre like me , you cant bear to let go .
old mrs .
she hung about waiting for her chance , and at last she got it and went off with the child .
in fact , he said , shes quite adorableand i adore her .
well , what the hell was i to do with the things ?
you have come to me to ask me something ?
the ruler , prince ali yusuf , managed to escape , flown out by his own private pilot .
but , of course , if you are going up to town , that is much better .
you may be assured that i will take every precaution .
yes , sometimes .
she cried : i dont believe it !
she murmured : i feel so inadequate .
i dare say you can guess the reason of all these questions .
actually , hed only stayed here about three or four days .
' she demanded , as she sank into chair .
is that mayfair _num_ ?
all right then , said the inspector sceptically .
switzerlands all right .
after dinner , he announced , i shall go right away and see jane .
i think miss arundell acted very wisely .
cant suspect the servants .
he can return it , in the manner suggested by sir claud , or else he can hide it somewhere , under cover of that one minute of total darkness .
it seemed likely to me that you would inform yourself on that point .
nothing much , m .
theres no such thing in this tinpot country .
but ellies world was a different world .
it is necessary for everyone to attend .
that was the burden of them .
then , as i did not speak , he went on : etherington took drugsof coursebut he overdid it .
sutcliffe cut him short .
i see nothing .
arent you being a bit pessimistic ?
just like we have hairpins and powder puffs .
that was no longer so .
i began to think that the elements of drama were wasted on miss oglander , that her lack of imagination rose superior to any tragedy .
i used to scold him about it .
ii on the bedhampton motorway , nine miles away , a steady stream of night lorries was grinding its way north .
she was yawning and twisting a scarlet poppy in her hands .
exactly !
blunt looked at him inquiringly .
a womans hair ?
he said : ' " i ' m sorry , gentlemen , to have to keep you waiting , but i have some urgent business to attend to .
then he said , with a change of tone : tomorrow , i am to visit the man cust , and he added to the chauffeur : back to london .
virginia looked up at the clock .
my dear poirot , the daughter was a mere infant at the time of the trial .
still , she would have had to travel with the familyprobably having to talk all the way .
ive spent the whole evening trying to spot x .
used to spend most of my leaves here .
who else but you could have murdered him ?
stephen said : forget it , sandra , for gods sake , let us forget it !
it had started , had it not , with that casual but startling remark by poppy , that if you wanted to get rid of someone the pale horse was the place to go .
if so , who could that man be ?
i think you did !
just a year , said mrs waverly .
lytcham roche is not down yet ?
please ?
satterthwaite will be disappointed .
lynn and the maid came behind him .
oh yes , he could tell them .
yes as you say , one has a good birds eye view of the world from here .
poirot , eyeing him with distaste , said to himself , in verity , there are some englishmen who are altogether so unpleasing and ridiculous that they should have been put out of their misery at birth .
she married a man in the north of england and he died a few years ago leaving her very comfortably off .
on the palm of his hand he held out the tiny silk rosebud .
no , no , i am not making an accusationquelle ide !
when haydock went off this morning , our people took charge at smugglers rest .
we were talking about miss pinkerton .
for the face before him was the face of the picture , but strangely and incredibly beautified .
the wagon lit conductor left the compartment .
some french duke started her .
pity , because i liked her .
tommy beresford was one of those young englishmen not distinguished by any special intellectual ability , but who are emphatically at their best in what is known as a tight place .
their boyfriends ?
it was a great interest in his life .
so there have been memories leading to theoriestheories of infidelity , of illness , of suicide pacts , of jealousy , all these things have been suggested to you .
then eccles turned back suddenly to say , oh yes , theres just one other thing .
my dearmy very dear friend !
it needed boldness .
miss williams said drily : thats one thing to be thankful for !
but today , the inspector felt slightly more hopeful .
he died two or three minutes later .
yes , i will .
she reminds me a little of my mother without having her brilliance and intellectual interests .
celia was jealous of sally .
it will be hastings who will have to do that , said poirot , twinkling at me .
thought i hadnt seen you around .
poirot asked , using an old-fashioned term : did mary gerrarderencourage his advances ?
yes , sooner or later , the memory will returnas suddenly as it went .
the donald ross business was just sheer bad luck .
tonight , the will would have been read , naming madame her residuary legateeand then the pistol would be found in her coatthe pistol with which maggie buckley was shot .
a week later we had a wire from the bank manager in whose hands financial arrangements had been left , saying that he thought a satisfactory solution had been found .
' mrs waverly looked at him reproachfully .
just so , mademoiselle , but reflect a minute .
something was puzzling emily brewster .
what did they threaten you with ?
hugo trent .
well , said sarah , im young and i havent got much experience of dead bodiesbut i know enough to be quite sure of one thing .
it was just an act of emotional defiance , of rebellion , of a longing to be free , of the conviction that she would never be free untiluntil her mother wasnt there any longer .
then , with an apologetic smile , he returned with a small looking glass which he carefully affixed upon a nail on the wall .
i suppose , you know , we coulderwe could dispose of her .
tell me , humfries , how do all these old dears manage to come and stay here ?
hes a horrible man , clarissa agreed .
shed never realized properly , somehow , until now , how very much she disliked arlena .
he was used to it , as you might say .
trs bien , he said .
but the fact remains , however , that she did not change her mind !
and soand so he died .
eversleigh and mr .
but to mrs .
it rang with sudden confidence .
ive checked up , said spence .
he noticed the gloves that had been lying under the cushion .
i dont think either of the two women overheard .
on the day of his death he threatened to cut down your allowance .
some bigwig .
its because the lawyer has beenmr .
ill go up with you , said bess .
look at the state were in !
he heard chairs being pushed back and turning his head , noted that the two middle-aged women still discussing former grievances had paid their bill and were now leaving the shop .
he said quietly and calmly : the interesting point is the date .
this has got to be stopped , i said angrily .
they had reached the end of the long gallery .
its anthony marston !
youre mark easterbrook , arent you ?
and you knew richard abernethie for that time also !
is there anything ?
grim , murmured frankie , looking out of the window .
what could he have to gain by it ?
it may be said that sir rupert had kept up his olympian manner and had taken no notice whatever of his fellow travellers .
and then it was carter .
i tossed and turned for a good while and in the end decided id let m .
craven , do me justice .
to begin with , im going down to the cootes for the weekend , he said significantly .
i suppose if i had been really bright i should have seen the line his thoughts were taking .
helen reflected .
his irritable demand that he should be left alone and the others go up to lunch was quite characteristic of the man , i should say .
mei do not care .
ellis lost his temper , said , damn the thing , and hurled it across the room .
thats where hewell , thats where he was supposed to be going .
in cranchester ?
how do you mean , what does he do ?
i am going to lay bare the underlying structure of this place .
lombard said to rogers : get some brandy .
no , richard , you mustnt .
she threw open a door and motioned the inspector inside .
wouldnt be good for you to go down with one of those .
a good naval harboura good-looking young naval commandercame of a good family , father had been an admiral .
in doing so , of course , she signed her own death warrant .
but problems , mon cher , are not so easy to come by .
yours ever , ann letter from miss johnson to her sister : dear edith , everything much the same as usual here .
oh no , i was terrified , then .
i usually do this room myself as cleaning women are apt to be careless with ornaments .
she walked up behind the desk and stood looking down at the dead man .
it was slightly cold but not unduly so and she enjoyed the smell of scented blossoms .
come on , pick it up .
have you ever heard lady edgwareor perhaps id better call her miss wilkinsonutter threats against her husband ?
i was on the same scent myself , of course i felt instinctively that japp was straining the truth here but there , i promised to let him play the thing out his own way .
she said : tom seems like a stranger to me now .
you will find him in the coffee room .
it simply couldnt have happened .
he may not have been able to find at once what he sought .
his eyes met those of his inspector .
did anyone come to see her last night ?
a slight clink of glasses made them both swing round .
i expect youll miss her very much .
no , dont put them in shelves yet , albert .
so you believe tim didnt know he had killed the wrong woman ?
the whisperer sneezed heavily before ringing off .
she was very fond of locking up things , though prone to lose her keys .
simeon sat chuckling to himself .
bill responded with alacrity and made various suggestions as to lunch , tea , dinner and dancing .
she dragged him after her up the ladder .
it took an exceptionally beautiful and clever wife to keep them at home .
all right , he was looking for something .
the home secretary himself shall recommend you .
after about four minutes had passed the door opened again .
she replaced the receiver on the hook and turned to face her husband , breathing hard .
a paternal warning against the big bad wolf ?
and the door openingjust a dim figure standing there with a revolver and that blinding light and a menacing voice saying your money or your life !
leidner died intestate but possessed of a considerable fortune , i should imagine that it would prove an interesting question as to who inherited the moneyyouor a former husband .
the wheels screamed as they gripped the metals .
it seemed straightforward enough , but mr .
dickens .
but what is the cause of all this ?
whoever the dead woman is , she is not martine .
had he foreseen this arrest ?
yet how could anyone wish to harm her ?
i bought it for you .
the mustard compartment also contained salt .
theres something very peculiar about all this , she said .
its extraordinary .
that she pretended to speak as patricia lane , and that patricia lane was already dead .
but you could tell me the story , i said , wheedlingly .
but naturally i never said anythingbut she must have guessed .
mint tea arrived .
if youll stand up , elizabeth , ill brush down the back of your coat .
what are you up to , em ?
he was a lawyer , a mr .
and here , too , is successful opportunism .
but of course , miss marple went on , it was dora bunner who was the real danger .
i cant think why women worry so about servants .
when the music stopped , she sat down by poirot looking happy and excited .
meganmegan , how i wish you were here .
it was a thing she had always hoped for .
i beg your pardon , said mrs .
superintendent sugden said gently but firmly : i rather fancy that we soon shall .
i wanted to be alone .
suddenly he began to cry .
no one shall know from me .
you know that he gave up his house at loomouth ?
then through the door , said miss henderson impatiently .
they all meant one thingveronica .
i always keep them locked up .
and if it were put in a smelling salt bottle and substituted for the real onewell , the poor lady was in the habit of using her smelling salts .
i dont mean what you mean .
the man told him that the telegram had been given him by a loony lady in the house in the park .
suzanne made one of her sympathetic noises again and sir eustace proceeded , in a still more aggrieved tone : and , if thats not enough , the fellow who murdered her has the impudence , the colossal impudence , to attach himself to me as my secretary .
she wrote it down so , and so it shall be .
let him into the house ?
its a lonely world .
i remember mrs .
because of the photograph .
i suppose , she said , that when you are , well , investigating a thing , youd always have to have a pretext ?
no thank you , dear .
he was a thin , dark man of middle age , sallow of complexion , with a small pointed beard .
mis , - ' o : s tanning was as .
his voice now was stern .
the next mistress to appear was eileen rich .
oh , come in , gipsy girl .
i am coming straight to the point .
well go away together .
she had , to begin with , an interest in culture and in modern sciencethat is , a distinct intellectual side .
all about one of these millionaire blokes who neglected his wife ; and then she pretended shed done the dirty on him .
jeremy been getting himself into queer street ?
he will inherit , yes ?
jack filled and lit the pipe with fingers that trembled a little in spite of himself .
yesand i shouldnt get another job as easily as you will .
you know , the one who was murdered .
by the waythe wound .
carol shivered .
harmon , yes .
the original of that photograph was the french girl , annette , who saved his life .
shes a good-looking girland she waited at tableno , it wont do .
i dont believe in this villain-behind-the-scenes motif .
do you know , anne , i believe the best thing we could do would be to confide in him and tell him the whole story .
you say , because he is thinking of something else .
we all had a terrific hunt .
suddenly emily said : do you know that queer feeling you get when somebody is looking at you ?
but who was the appointment with ?
none so sad for his missus , said the old man .
there does not seem to be anybody who (in detective story parlance) could benefit by stephen babbingtons death .
do you know how much ?
he spoke german well , didnt he ?
riddells obviously nervous wife , the growling of mr .
and what are we going to do about it ?
then you think ?
do you care for red roses at all , mr .
all the old anguish and despair came back .
for with women it will not only be the value .
in the end i did how do you think as a plumber , mon ami !
whoever turned that key from the outside must have had some knowledge of the job .
a woman i knew had concussion during the war , said miss gilchrist conversationally .
yes , rather funny , wasnt it ?
you must eat nothing , mademoiselle , that comes in from outside .
just a boy and girl affair .
well , said poirot .
fatal dose could be as low as one grain .
the results of our evenings correspondence were somewhat varied .
not for a considerable time .
but what that woman suffered !
its better to give in .
pagett retired .
i am arranging for a special concert at the albert hall .
a little cold breeze sprang up and hilary gave a quick shiver .
protheroe went down to the studio ?
the other book was the play john fergueson by st .
said the count doubtfully .
and the mechanism of the hands ?
quelle belle vie !
for a moment the suspicion crossed lucys mind that miss marple was mentally unhinged , but she rejected the idea .
what do you think of that , gentlemen ?
the lady will want it .
but it should be different for me .
when it was family produced he studied it with some care .
there were several smaller prizeshens , sacks of flour , and from a hundred eggs down to ten .
she was then in mr .
it is your business to notice such things , said poirot encouragingly as he clapped the other on the shoulder .
yes , she said , and added in a burst of confidence , wed only known each other a fortnight .
the first is the telephone call to a victoria number .
so you know , sir eustace ?
we know when that dagger was stolen .
such an ass !
he chuckled and rose slowly to his feet , an amiable white-haired gnome .
but i wasnt scared .
settle , i said , you dont like lady carmichael .
i never knew what he was up to .
poirot murmured : excuse me , m .
i ' m sure it ' s frightfully bad for me .
he tugged at them vigorously to assure me of their genuine character .
ill tell you this .
you mean that you still believethat one of ushere in this room her voice died away .
well nourished but not fat .
i have come across certain evidence today he detailed the conversation he had had with old angus , charles arundells interest in the weed killer , and finally the old mans surprise at the emptiness of the tin .
would it be possible for you , m .
and inwardly he thought to himself : i can get a most interesting sermon out of that idea .
his house is on chelsea embankment .
why the a b c ?
but satan and satans emissaries were never more powerful than they are today !
madame olivier gave a faint cry on seeing us .
seems a nice quiet girl , too .
by all means , let dinner be served .
you meanyou meanwide , terrified eyes fixed themselves on his facethat i might have done it ?
three spades , four hearts , four no trumps , pass , she muttered , pointing at each hand as she made its call .
i didnt really want him to kill himself , but i was very deeply in love with jeremy , and there was nothing i could do about it .
but elvira , when they do notice its gone , theyll thinkperhaps theyll knowthat you must have taken it .
regard yourself , he said .
simon looked at him rather startled .
there are other places .
stephen drew a deep breath .
bantrys astonished protest of really , jane .
bauerstein had been there that evening .
marbury , testing an iron against her cheek before beginning to iron out lilys silk slip .
nevile looked surprised .
i checked myself and looked at him .
i was right , said tommy , as they went down the drive , crocketts in it .
her eyes which had wavered over heather badcocks shoulder , now seemed to be fixed on the wall midway up the stairs .
paravicini was in the big drawing room .
i think all she looked now was sad .
was not at tavistock when accidents occurred .
i dont really see what my personal relationships to people has to do with the matter in hand , m .
well , i mean i was here when the girl screamed .
you will be spared all the unpleasantness .
again and again , she , mrs .
carla said : hallo , aunt angela .
we assured him that this was what we did want .
he showed me into the drawing room , switching on the electric lights since the blinds were down .
from the vantage point of her garden , so admirably placed to see all that was going on in st .
you would be ready to encourage the spearhead there ?
now , you must hurry , clarissa ordered them vehemently .
im not quite clear yet , sir george , as to the circumstances of all this .
i pushed past him into the hall .
according to charles himself he did tell her .
earlier on it would have mattered to find out who you were and who sent you .
sybil stamfordis , perhapswith her saris and her scarabs , and always seeing auras round peoples headsshe is rather ridiculous .
no , plenty of that type about .
what i thoughtwhat we thoughti mean , what katharinei mean , what we both thought yes ?
easy there , now .
yes , there is a pattern .
merdell can tell you that i talked to him on the quay .
good beds , good cookingroomy , victorian wardrobes .
that is the only possible solution .
he could imagine that this dearest girl in the world might have a very decided reason for wanting the removal of mrs .
when the door was shut , and they were preparing to say good-bye to him on the landing , poirot forestalled them .
however , they went away again .
he retrieved it , and buried it neatly .
a friendly house .
it seemed a perfectly clear case .
she had no idea what he could have been like in business .
well , old fellow went to a i doctor and the doctor changed his diet .
i recounted to her the events of the morning .
otherwise i would have let myself in for a lot of trouble .
oh , yesyes she hesitated .
he threw the parcel on his bed when he returned to the hotel and looked at it with annoyance .
but why should you think that this young man , who was presumably fond of you , should want to kill you ?
i had not been followed .
she was a person who was capable of violent fits of unhappiness .
what do you mean , cant find your car ?
he opened the parlour door .
a large bell with a chain had a notice upon it to ring for the ferry .
explains what ?
it is verity hunt you mean ?
it is i , myself .
clarissa clenched her fists and made an angry gesture .
everyone says so .
she looked out over the garden with unseeing eyes .
iris couldnt put it off any longer .
my sister was the most indefatigable woman i have ever known ; a kind of human dynamo .
the darkroom opens out of the photographic room ?
leo , helen , he knew well , of course .
sorry if hed given it up and he said , well , its not only that i cant get what i was trying for .
and now its over .
it was a family matter ?
what do you suppose the brother and sister went off to london for ?
she was so odd in her manner that evening i told you about .
he turned to the inspector .
my hand will fall to my side , the revolver , pulled by the elastic , will recoil to the door , jarred by the door handle it will detach itself from the elastic and fall .
he sat there looking at her , blinking his eyes thoughtfully .
susan said lightly : its a waste of timehaving regrets .
not for a moment did i imagine that i had been sent for because of the shock occasioned by ackroyds death .
he died when i was a child .
it was a wide field .
chester was unhappy in pollensa bay , it was not going to be made easy for her to consult mr .
but not she .
momentarily , he sounded almost smug .
but im not .
angus and i have been married for twenty years .
bantry , said sir henry .
that is just what i want to find out .
wade ?
if , as you say , miss johnson is available , i will hear the next part from her .
i expect hes got the same sort of mother .
aha , cerberus ?
i must have a key hidden somewhere but i dont know where ive hidden it .
you looked most odd , standing there clasping currant bread to your breast with your mouth wide open .
dermot stared at her .
he said : theres my mothers money .
stephen farr laughed .
it swept round in an uneven semicircle and at its lower end the builders were still at work .
i had little to do save nod my head and look intelligentand that last is perhaps over optimistic .
i do in some ways , yes , said eileen rich .
he shot her a quick , shrewd glance .
he had his own methods of approach to a subject , and it was not until well on towards midnight , when sipping a glass of fragrant old brandy , that mr .
can i come in ?
because it occurred to me that id like to see miss marple first , to make quite sure that no one did pass along the lane yesterday evening whilst we were in the studio .
i just remember a couple of hands .
she did not answer , but disappeared behind the hedge .
you agree , mademoiselle ?
he busied himself with other cases and , as i say , he displayed no interest when the subject was mentioned .
but anyway , there it was .
that safe , it is far too old-fashionedquite an amateur might have opened it .
fifteen hawess appearance distressed me very much .
leidner about leaving , i said .
he said doubtfully : do youerwrite detective stories ?
but the load was not taken off dr .
he was rambling and delirious .
i was at a hospital one day in london .
its closed down .
shes much better now , and shes happy at school , and thats the way shes going to remain .
' the young man shook his head .
number nine is the lower berth , said the conductor .
' ' yes , i know .
its what made us , you might say , get acquainted .
assuredly i would have stopped you .
a delightful place .
do it ?
i must break the news to the ladies , lady cynthia and my dear wife .
who discovered the crime ?
there was a slightly steely glitter in her eyes .
you dont understandyou cant begin to understand .
as for crale , he came out of the library , found elsa with philip blake , and brusquely ordered her down to go on with the sitting .
summerhayes would notice .
you have no sense of the dramatic .
george withdrew .
the superintendent seemed rather pleased than otherwise .
amberiotisa crook and a blackmailer !
we were in all day .
robbery with violence , assaultled the most extraordinary double life .
perhaps shes committed suicide .
you are illogical !
a toneless voice replied .
she moved with that insolent effortless grace that is common to those who have been professional mannequins .
talks a good deal but definitely heard nothing , saw nothing and knew nothing .
what train did he go on ?
id be prepared to bet he made that up .
she will play her part carefully .
i cant imagine , said colin .
but what evidence of that is there ?
hes frightfully curious about money matters .
he had twice seen sir charles act , and the excitement and rapture of seeing this hero of the footlights in a flesh-and-blood manner made him as friendly and loquacious as could be wished .
you dispensed certain medicines for her yourself ?
wednesday , you know , at eleven , or is it eleven thirty ?
his valet , monsieur , and the young american gentleman his secretary .
so the case for richards murder rested not only upon what cora had said but upon cora herself .
he looked attentively at the claw foot of an antique table and addressed his remarks to it .
an unhappy woman thanks you , m .
from beneath the chair poirot picked up a small object .
goodthen let us say friday .
we shant forget it , said mr .
the super-detective always has his rooms littered with rubies and pearls and emeralds from grateful royal clients .
yes , you can tell me what your quarrel with your brother was about that evening .
i had to go down and talk to a police superintendent .
theres a door outside it into the garden .
if she wanted him dead , i should think she might have chosen some other method .
he stopped , thunderstruck .
apparently mrs .
that is usually the case ?
naturally , she gets flustered now and then .
we usually celebrated if one or other of us had received a food parcel .
so she , too , felt as i did .
but i dont know anything to tell .
how like a woman !
they prefer private investigations .
what an animal , that !
i wrote thingsyesbooks and stories .
macadam knew nothing of these precautions .
his ruling passion of secrecy held strong to the end .
it was astonishing how clearly you could see no .
i didnt think it was all her fault , but the fact remained that dear ugly miss johnson , and that common little spitfire mrs .
he may have knocked she got up and opened the door and he forced his way in and killed her .
it reveals the subconscious mind .
anyway , hes a pretty good age .
she had blamed miss springer for not obtaining support before going out to investigate , but it never occurred to her to do so .
that stuff ?
japp is the younger generation knocking on the door .
you played the cards ?
said inspector curry genially .
i stifled an uneasy certainty that josephine was very much all there .
not only has your body got to recover , but your nerves have been weakened by the necessity of keeping you under drugs for so long .
johnson led tommy , again escaping the closing doors by a mere inch , along a passage to a door .
he forebore to point out that they were not in sargon springs but in the principality of monaco , where the countess happened to synchronize with her environment a great deal better than miss martin did .
you had no previous acquaintanceship with the family ?
here , as we know , i was wrong , and i was forced to abandon the idea .
shes in bed and asleep .
one of the waitresses in the grill .
she flushed a little .
it was , very faintly , a caricature of the lovely unearthly smile that had transformed the girls face so short a time before .
who expected money and didnt get money , particulars of ladies hairdressing , wigs , name of the supplier of wigs , charming rose-coloured cardboard boxes they came in by the way .
pennington seemed reluctant to accept them .
babbington is ill .
ive followed whittington and another man here .
it was gladys , of course , said miss marple .
you will probably have to take my word up to a certain point , though i can show you letters addressed to me , and possibly official documents that might convince you .
any ideas about this one ?
doesnt he usually tell you where hes going ?
what did it meanthis apparently innocent-sounding missive ?
naysmith .
can i still go on trying ?
this was unexpected but promising .
so you suspected him all along , you say ?
you have , at the very least , two friends .
i meanfrom the police point of view , will the case be reopened ?
its nonsense .
zeropoulos measured a space on his desk , and so thickyou see , like this pen of mine .
death is estimated to have taken place from thirteen to ten hours previously .
but , my dear boy , you cant do things like thatnot in a place like this .
did she seem quite as usual when starting on this journey ?
he said quickly : ive seen you play at wimbledon , sir .
i bill positively choked .
it was an intonation of voice that he remembered from the old days when mr .
i should like to return to london .
now what about a drop of soup or some hot bread and milk ?
poirot said gently : surely .
lucasswhat do they call it ?
they started a laughing conversation together .
bantry with dignity .
liking a private joke is much better than having some deal with a defector .
which made me go out into the garden in search of any likely source of weed killer .
but you dont know the best .
poirot said : the heredity , it is very interesting .
for , from the point of view of the olive branch , her complete disappearance would be very disconcerting .
it is eight kilometres from here , you understand .
parker indeed !
she keeps him well-tied to her apronstrings .
it would consist of only one single note , remember .
she has really a first-class braina mans brain .
it would not be a question of dinner last night .
funny idea of pleasureworse racket than the natives make with their tom-toms .
) diagonally across down the car .
and its fortunate i was on the spot , the latter said afterwards .
' my uncle ?
you have the word of hercule poiroti can say no more !
asked james kleek .
and then , out of the blue , the great day came .
he was out on a caseover middlingham way .
over this room .
not from all ive heard about him .
vi in the library elinor had just finished a letter : dear mr .
old simeon said : poor stick , george !
she wont be dictated to in any way .
perhaps theyll think out some kind of defence for him .
the fees are doubled , but we put all our available staff onto the case .
six months .
is there anything further you would like to ask me , sir ?
dinner was served to him there , and he did not meet the other members of the house party .
the man who lives in it prefers comfort to beauty , i should say .
he sent back word that i could go to hell , replied the millionaire succinctly .
mr mayhew was a thin , dry , cautious gentleman .
raking up things .
the futures much more important .
nothing can be so misleading as observation .
did i not tell you that hercule poirot knows everything ?
what a work of art !
and pass through the postern of fate !
luke stored away that small fact as possibly relevant .
how fast you go .
and then with a sudden , quick twist of humour : shed never let on to me if there were !
she spent many years in a pensionnat abroad .
i dont see what thats got to do with anything .
the coroner then asked him : have you been able to identify the dead man ?
rival , he said .
damn it all , melchett , i tell you ive never set eyes on that girl in my life !
oh dear , i dont like it nigel wheeled at her accusingly .
they started back towards the hotel again but almost ran into a burly figure .
there are always so many last-minute things to see to .
i love you madly and you dont care a bit .
then theres henry .
sandford , i think it was , the architecting gentleman whos building the queer house .
theyll try to get him again , he said .
i had not realised how much desert there was in persia , and i now understood why the persians so appreciated gardensit was because it was so very difficult to have gardens .
she must thinkgo backremember .
the tea and coffee and the hot dishes were all on hot plates on the sideboard .
yes , i was lucky to get appledore .
he spoke with a certain grim satisfaction , then shook his head with a slight smile , as he met marys reproachful gaze .
he is very tiresome that way .
accelerated with a sudden astonishing speed .
perhaps you would come and have a cup of tea with me somewhere ?
so thats your idea , is it ?
matchams last remaining relatives .
again he fell silent , and katherine did not interrupt his train of thought .
and the right person wasyou , monsieur ?
but you realize that i am anxious to get the fullest information as soon as possible .
they said when they rang up from the office that hed had a kind of fit .
like a highly-flavoured sauce concealing the fact that the fish _num_ underneath it is none of the best !
in an agreeable everyday voice he asked a question .
it was rotten to have a stepmother , everybody said so .
he thought : has she no imagination ?
oh , no , tim !
emily brent said , pleasant sound .
oratava was lovely .
it is supposed , i said , to induce punctuality .
of coursemost tiring for you .
they do say , you know , as she played in the tournaments in her time , said isaac .
i do not eat oranges myself .
this is most unusual , said the duchess severely .
he said thoughtfully : yes , that is true .
the boys have been having such fun that one almost thought of it all as a game .
' carlile ' s voice was repressive .
that was an error most grave .
i suppose edgware was shot some time yesterday evening ?
loraine wade , also unaccompanied , strolled down one of the shady garden paths .
the conceit of you .
she said , addressing symmington , but giving him no title (and i suddenly reflected that i never heard her call him anything .
the foreigners are settling down well .
he got a short sentence and was taken on by fullerton , harrison and leadbetter when he came out of prison .
' there was a momentary pause , then japp said : ' as far as you know , did mrs allen have any enemies ?
twenty-five postscript at torquay but , of course , dear gwenda , i should never have dreamed of going away and leaving you alone in the house , said miss marple .
abernethie speaking .
blood !
but it must be there , cried elliot haydon .
just a couple of proverbs .
steal a womans money and ask her if shes happy .
i have an idea in the back of my mind that something in it struck me as rather curious .
nothing , said katherine ; but would you mind if he did come down to see me ?
satisfied , betty relapsed into murmurs again .
everybody seems to know everybody else in this part of the world .
but that doesnt alter the seriousnesstheerseriousness he paused , rather at a loss .
and you like her ?
davenheim in the last few years for buying jewellery .
any serious illnesses .
asked rydesdale .
my telegram ?
did you enjoy your walk ?
i understand the symptoms came on immediately he had drunk the tea ?
; ow , come on .
yes , but i thought i cant help what you thought .
her looks are all right .
nothing !
we all left together .
he caught her in his arms and felt the responsive quiver of her scarlet lips .
the cliffords at chudleigh were giving a dance to which they were asking members of the garrison from exeter , and they asked some of their friends if they could bring a likely girl or two along .
asked janet .
curtiss .
its been awful for him , she said .
it is impossible to think of lady stranleigh as an ordinary mother .
it was growing on himthis belief that the last lytcham roche of lytcham close was omnipotent .
actually , wed met just near the house and only about two minutes before we met you .
he said : nofret .
if youve spoken the truth , you wont have anything to complain about .
if he was my father they couldnt do anything to me !
it was one of the french children who had been playing at the waters edge .
well , thats clear enough , said police constable abel .
its a hard thing , knighton , he said , how little one can do for those one loves .
he answered thenvery gravely : yes , madame , i will guarantee that .
dont you know how to greet your fathers concubine when he brings her to his house ?
or he could keep it in his own possession until such time as carmichael claimed it ?
ackroyds family must , of course , do what they see fit , said colonel melrose .
if it had been inglethorp who was carrying on an intrigue with mrs .
and thats when well get him .
havering will be here in a moment , i explained .
bauerstein was unable to account for the delay before the symptoms manifested themselves .
she was a healthy woman .
i particularly dont want thesiger down next weekend , he said at last .
tuppence unrolled the little parcel and drew out a magnificent string of pearls , exquisitely matched .
what did meadowes think about spain ?
hows my father , tressilian ?
very well , i will read them to you .
if you like , said lynn politely .
lewis serrocold frowned angrily .
it seemed incredible that less than twenty-four hours had passed since i last sat at that table .
cried hilary .
she was a very proud womanone could see that .
what sort of an idea ?
youyou she stood there tremblingunable to speak .
a faint chord of remembrance stirred in miss marples mind at the sight of the blotted scrawled handwriting .
did you both come back here together ?
it wasnt till we heard mr .
miss lawson sighed and shook her head .
at the moment he was engaged in methodically recording facts .
there is , of course , something discreditable behind his silence .
luke caught her suddenly by the shoulders .
there was this box and some flowers alsosweet peasfrom a mr .
not so completely as you imagine , i think , said dr .
scobell ?
no , no , i meant cases of undue influence .
was it some birds cry in the distance that he had twisted into the semblance of a womans voice ?
said his friend , frowning .
she wokedozed again , occasionally glancing without interest at the magazine she held .
but what a mercy for your little doctor man that you didnt marry him .
but well , i said to myself , well , this is a surprise .
miss ginch , i said .
his eyebrows asked a question of his employee .
in tidying up dr .
i think she hesitated , i think she is perhaps rather an inquisitive person .
' women distrust the _num_ official police .
what damned crooks ?
ah , my mother ?
just for the moment , in my excitement , it seemed to clear up the whole matter .
lord caterham took a key from his pocket and unlocked a door , flinging it open .
my cousin didnt think so .
i shouldnt drink anymore , said marina , ive had three already .
hes steel .
and hes devoted to freddie .
but now , unfortunately , there was the evening to put in .
is that where she usually kept important papers ?
susan cardwell gave him a quick glance , then transferred her gaze to ruth .
i thought so too , she admitted .
i used to have nightmares about her when i was a child , you know .
but how do you know it wasnt miss henderson if you didnt see her face ?
rather hot stuff , i imagine .
they agreed together on the general romance and desirability of sweeps and deplored the attitude of an unsympathetic english government .
he goes in , say , and finds her .
no one can say that i have failed in my duty , continued mrs .
but , there , turning out takes you longer than you think .
that kay creature doesnt worry whether i approve of her or not .
go on , said the girl .
bess looked at him and laughed .
nothing out of the way orbut yes , yes , in one small detail , miss lemon was right .
my dear mamma is never violent .
hercule poirot was not at all put out .
he added in an offhand manner : i thought id just mention it .
rafiels bark was a great deal worse than his bite .
a bearded gentleman received her enthusiastically in his arms .
i do hope amy was apologetic .
she sat with her mouth slightly open and her large , sad , dark eyes fixed on the countess .
is that right ?
now we come to the fatal night .
i have been thinking of miss celia and how she died and that someone , after she was dead , must have come into her room and left there the empty morphia bottle and the little piece of paper that say she killed herself akibombo paused and the inspector nodded .
he pausedthen he said , with a quick savagery of tone : oh , what the hells the use of all this slick talking ?
do you want to see it ?
sir rowland shook his head .
she stared hard at him .
flatterer , said lady stranleigh , but she said it vaguely and it was clear that her mind was elsewhere .
that man was devoted to him and so were all the others .
it doesnt do , you know , to hold anything back from the police .
the servant girl chimed in to say : thats right .
why a policeman ?
and then , too , he , the patient , i mean , said something queer .
they were of the household , he thought , but they were also in the old-fashioned feudal sense of the term those who sat below the salt .
it is a very long time , really , since i have been there .
i look for something , but i know not what it is .
her body was still but not relaxed .
everything seemed strangely silentexcept our car , which i should think was the first ford ever made by man !
' ' i thank you , madame .
bantry was just as pleased .
she said : but , miss brentmiss brentin that case yes , my dear ?
poirot doesnt have to go and see things , i said .
and a semidetached with small conservatory .
savages symptoms puzzled the doctor he may have spoken seriously , pulled a long face , spoken of certain expensive treatments and while reassuring him as to cancer yet have conveyed the impression that something was seriously wrong .
neither one thing nor the other .
he sniffed it and handed it to tommy .
then , when the war came , i went back to europe .
miss meredith gave a little gasp as she said : what a queer man he is !
i think you will recognize me when you do see me .
at marlow .

said the baron .
a man , i suppose , would have had a stiff peg ; but girls derive a lot of comfort from ice cream sodas .
died in st .
doesnt know where he was or when and theres nobody who seems to have seen him .
asked the steward .
but its coming , declared tommy .
sir edwin said : with your permission , my lord , i will read this aloud , and it can then go to the jury .
bloodhounds seek blonde typists killer !
sounds more as though it were a married womanyou know , someone whose husband had just died , or who was divorcing him .
is this really true ?
men had their sexual fun with married women , usually a good deal older than themselves , or else with little friends in london , about whom no one was supposed to know .
renauld , he embraced her with gallic fervourslightly to my annoyance .
mrs allen wasn ' t that kind of lady , i ' m sure .
its just a sort of knack .
because of something you saw or heard ?
a farmer , some time previously , happened to have passed up a certain path in a wood nearby .
it was after that that it might have been difficult .

no , no , it is quite different .
he said , with more spontaneity than he had yet shown : thats what i used to ask myself , day after day .
then he turned to dermot .
what was the difference ?
often the way with these old families .
she said goodbye again and hurried away .
oh , that kind of generosity .
" 	figs country and a _num_ , id have knocked wp down with a feather , ' con t/hued miss duma .
one of the better ones , i believe .
if he had done so , i would have woken up at once .
they had come to him with their story of wanting to get married and he had taken it upon himself to decide that they should get married .
hes telling you , said tommy , that he is a very clever dog .
thats why she managed to break one of rubys nails on her shawl .
fleshpots .
and i begin to suspect that in miss martindale we have the lady macbeth of this crime , a woman who is ruthless and unimaginative .
id like a spot of face powder , said emily wistfully .
for a few moments , a tense silence prevailed .
he usually is .
davids laugh made her flush .
pure , well-enunciated englishmost important , chief inspector .
it will be my duty to call before you witnesses who can help you to form a true conclusion on these matters .
whowho are you ?
) who is the boy friend mentioned in her note as supplying the drug ?
poirot said : you have observed in your time a conjurer offer a card , have you not ?
if she had screamed she would have been heard .
i pushed open the door it was closed , then ?
gardener pursued the theme .
oh , a little time agoa weekno , more .
there is nothing else that you can think of ?
la bonne chance , it cannot always be on your side .
she was killed outright .
i am perfectly serious .
if he had approached her or had suggested that they meet again , feeling perhaps a bond because of a life that had been saved between them , or of some other bond .
do , do !
nature takes over , you know .
you two are poles apart .
it could be , leblanc said dubiously , i suppose , a halting place for parties of people bound on a journey .
her eyes were thoughtful .
poirot gallantly produced some loose change , and he and mrs .
theres the blackmail angle still and theres the batty parson , but , personally , i think the dope solution is far the most likely .
dinsmead and his son johnnie brought up the rear .
make a day of it , and chuck everything all round .
he finished his breakfast and lay back on his pillows and read the times .
so this was a farewell party at the farradays ?
they were sent out , re-routed elsewhere .
lets have a look .
he said one thing hed never forget in all his life .
there were bowls of chrysanthemums .
i dont suppose it will ever be forgotten , do you ?
you see , said the girl , it means , well , trusting somebody .
oh , my friend , have i not said to you all along that i have no proofs .
i understood from your brother that he only bought this practice a few years ago .
darling , im not going to trail dangerous criminals .
why , he said , its alfred !
the sort of girl who cares only for men .
bundle is rising to the situation .
she spoke hurriedly .
you knew him before you were married ?
satterthwaite responded immediately .
sir george held out his hand .
yesbut its the not knowing .
i think it will be the same this time .
william was quite soft about her , i remember .
hes always been in love with mebut by now its become a kind of habit .
that gives her a motive .
so i packed up my things and went off to a little beach that i knew ofit was quite the opposite direction from the cave , and was rather a discovery of mine .
has lord whitfield seen through me too ?
looking at those smooth monkeys paws and hearing that voice in the hall it was you , she gasped .
she was on her way to the states , had to spend a couple of nights in london to see about some business or other .
i told you that there was a second speculation .
his face was white and strained .
that was entirely different , he snapped .
yes , thats the worst of these heart cases .
thats all got to be sifted out for what its worth .
the first letter ran as follows : thought youd doublecross us and get away with it , did you ?
and now you have a good nights sleep .
how did the police get on to us ?
already the genteel lady who presided over the shabby boardinghouse was looking askance at this particular young woman .
musnt make a fool of yourself , my dear .
how was griffith ?
to call franklin a saint was somewhat overstating the case , i thought , but barbara franklin went on , her eyes shining .
girls are frequently attracted to completely unsuitable , sometimes even dangerous young men .
teti is playing with it now .
all fair and squareno beating about the bush .
hardman winked .
but what was the thief after ?
for my sake .
i had an old chap in here the other day whod had a scarab pinchedterrible state he was innice old boy , but helpless as a baby in arms .
if you had to take pills or capsules , or a spoonful of something , you went out of the room to do so .
the thing was not quite as he had conceived itthat was impossible to hope forbut it was near enough .
the waiters enter the room and leathern retains the stone until they have left the room .
shortly before he was killed , he wrote to me from france .
supposing shed found out about it and he killed her ?
no , i should not describe myself as a friend .
sometimes a physician just strolls in for a chatslack moment .
oh yes , your problem .
the countess whirled round with her usual vehemence of movement .
poor , poor mrs .
most interesting , she said .
jim masterton had come home , and was a frequent visitor .
how ghastly , cried bundle .
you are so busy , i know , but then you have always been so very kind , colonel melchett , and i felt i would rather come to you instead of inspector slack .
from there a five-mile drive brought us to a small grey stone building in the midst of the rugged moors .
the same and rather more so , said judith .
hemmingno matter how wrapped up in her cats she isshould know so little about her neighbour , miss pebmarsh , as she does .
no , better not perhaps .
the three of us read it together .
you meanabout the murder ?
its quite impossible that jacko should be married to you .
did anyone believe her ?
mark , she said .
as you arrive her brother closes a book he is readingthrows it aside , says : not bad , but why on earth didnt they ask evans ?
she sees too much of that german fellow .
we pulled up in front of the station .
i was in great hopes that he was going to get the diamonds , and that by suddenly appearing and making myself known to him when he least expected it i might startle the truth out of him .
im shrivenham of the embassy .
especially as lynette brown wasnt there .
why , even under the health scheme a bitter note crept into anns voice .
ii hoped youd got over it , i suppose .
he half carried her into the library , and laid her on the leather couch .
i wanted to get on with my journey .
now we have the ravenscroft case .
a female voice had been screaming steadily from somewhere beyond the closed door .
the sooner we can get certain facts definitely established the better .
on the table beside him were various objects , neatly labelled .
and so it was that five days later i started for baghdad .
she said : have you found out anything ?
captain warburton , who wore a check sports coat and had a vaguely horsy appearance , showed a lot of white teeth in a somewhat wolfish smile , then continued his conversation .
and of course , the whole family might be wrong , and it might really be laurence and brenda after all .
there will be no funny business , i can promise you that .
that tin you threw out of the window didnt contain the diamonds .
it offended his male dignity .
she felt definitely annoyed with rhoda .
egg went on , unconscious of brutality : come home and have tea with mother .
this has been a terrible shock to me , inspector neele , as you can well imagine .
i got to know at least twenty or thirty young men reasonably well .
heavens , what a question !
i expect nurse would call that dark .
you remember her ?
she felt the hand that held hers stiffen suddenly .
you dont know of anyone whowell , might have had it in for miss gilchrist ?
angelica was her code name .
the animal in question is both large and fierce .
oh , hes very clever !
you could not have been misled by a resemblance ?
ah , sure , i get blamed for everything round here !
to begin with , i suppose a good many of the servants are family onestheyre your lot , i mean .
but certainly , madame , will you not sit down ?
it was a well-known idiosyncrasy of his , and caused no particular notice except to give rise to the remark that father was on the prowl again .
so clear , isnt it ?
i suggested our arranging this together simply because aunt lucilla changes her mind about everything every two minutes , and i thought it would be rather hard on you .
yet there had been a clue therethe traces of earth on the seat of the old chair in the washhouse .
was it a serious liaison ?
she broke off suddenly and enderby , glancing over his shoulder and following the direction of her eyes , became aware of a pink , healthy-looking young man leaning over the gate and making various apologetic noises to attract attention .
and soon forgotten .
you may or may not be right on that point , hastings .
satterthwaite , watching , he appeared by some curious effect of the stained glass above the door , to be dressed in every colour of the rainbow .
it is a likely thing as a foreigner would do , but it wouldnt be likely after all these years , would it ?
half unbelievingly jane picked up her gains .
it was a letter written by someone in close touch with celia .
he tortured her because he loved her .
a shop filled with glass , through which it was difficult to move , a rich persuasive voice , a compelling massive woman .
you havent anyany idea of your ownas to the identity of the murderer , i mean ?
i am unabashedly devoted to the objects of craftsmanship and art which turn up out of the soil .
theyre the best i can think of on the spur of the moment .
the little comedy i played for him did not deceive him .
everything must be explained .
as ive told you i dont really know anything about her .
at the far end , in the embrasure of the window , was a large writing-table .
dont tell me all this has something to do with espionage or something .
she might , yes , she admitted .
i still cant quite believe it , he said , with an excited little laugh .
im going to select a few what i call likely possibilities .
and the dispatch to general smuts ?
see , here is something bettera sweetoh , how good .
i walked up there on monday night .
wrapping a handkerchief around it , he ran back to the house , holding his left arm in the air and gasping with pain .
ginger was all rightshe hadnt had so much as a bad dream .
i thought when i went in that i was the one who was on top .
id got it firmly into my head that mrs .
wonder what it will be like to have young blood under this roof again ?
i might do it againim not a safe person any longer .
but some people just are like thatespecially in old families .
is there anything to be done about it ?
theres a torch there in the corner .
ii ?
and those eyes were at this minute fixed appealingly on the grizzled elderly bachelor doctor who , for the last five years , had ministered to the ailments of the village of st mary mead .
im the mistress here now and im telling you that your linen will bandage yet another body .
there cant be .
was playing bridge up to midnight .
righti can find him .
now that isnt right , mr .
both women laughed .
but what else had mrs .
she took an envelope from her pocket and handed it to him .
and did that somebody not find what he or she was looking for and come back the next day ?
but , as she was about to leave , she turned suddenly and ran to clarissa .
tuppence passed house after house , amusing herself by noting their names .
she has real talent , you know .
the hour that followed seemed the longest i had ever known .
her breast heaved .
but they wouldnt go so far as to do anything to bring about my demise .
had a scare of measlesbut its all right .
we had a very good view of all the surrounding scenery .
it had a flat roof with a square tower room on one side of it , and a handsome marble porch .
let me ask you one for a change .
the two men are so totally dissimilar .
i took hold of one .
for kings , for presidents , for politicians , for all those , in fact , upon whom the fierce light beats , as a poet has put it .
you permit , yes ?
it always infuriates one when other people know more about you than you know about yourself .
you think that will happen in this case ?
meredith blakes description of the drug she had slipped back to the laboratory , had emptied out a bottle of jasmine scent which was in her bag and had filled the bottle up with coniine solution .
she immediately cancelled her departure , and took pam off .
midge said coldly : why cant we catch the _num_ : _num_ ?
he sat for a long time in front of his fire , frowning to himself .
miss springer and miss vansittart .
i want to find some rope .
quite so , poirot agreed .
she just refused to give him some money , he caught up the poker and he threatened her , and when she stuck it out he lost control of himself and gave her a swipe .
she saw her partner , a blushing immature young man whose collar seemed too big for him , peering about for her .
i asks , and he says he didnt rightly notice .
he had two revolvers in the house , it seems .
i didnt ever know him really very well .
oh , he enjoyed losing his temper , said esther .
after all , her eyes were dim .
shes not likely to have taken him into her confidence .
to norma , david had been urging marriage .
itll do the stag no good to have a lot of gossip going about .
arbuthnot looked taken aback .
glorious cake , emma .
i believe , or so my father had always told me , that lady ravenscroft , molly , remained very devoted to her sister .
shes got something she badly wants to say to you .
surely , letty , you cant imagine hush , said miss blacklock quickly .
it seems to me quite ridiculous that anyone could imagine for a moment that she shot him , however much appearances may be against her .
in fact , shed have to pass through danemouth to get home .
has it been going on long ?
the things shed say .
and wasnt there something about a child of yours behind the chimney piece ?
all the same , he said when i had finished , my advice does not vary .
what a fool i am .
then he said a rather curious thing .
she just chose her local characters and adapted the story to fit in .
then he moved the hook up and down and spoke to the exchange .
she said with cold anger : what do you think youre doing here , may i ask ?
there were raffles of cakes , of baskets of fruit ; even , it seemed , of a pig ; and a lucky dip for children at twopence a go .
well , i had an idea as to that .
i wont have any friends you dont care about .
' la charnbre de domestique .
but i mustnt mention names .
i dont know what you mean ?
youve left it there ?
hes afraid im going to tell you the story of my life .
and , of course , thats what throws you off every time .
she was a very silly girl , you know .
craddock looked at her thoughtfully .
thanks for your help .
however , theres nothing like a cuppa , is there ?
who leaves the room firstdo you ?
canon pennyfathers face cleared and he nodded his head appreciatively .
ive bought two books on household management and one on mother love , and if that doesnt turn me out a pattern i dont know what will !
hugh stared at him .
what did he himself think of david ?
much better class than anything shed ever done before .
i come from the master , said boris in a low tone which nevertheless carried perfectly .
it was inspector morton who broke the spell .
hardly a cache of jewels .
i was born in england .
i found them rather unpractical sometimes .
i meant that to you a god is only a man or a woman who can do certain things that men and women cannot do .
tommy alone had been recruited .
tommy repeated that remark later as he sat by tuppences bedside and watched her eating grapes .
he was out of breath and panting hard .
its her , she said breathlessly and ungrammatically .
yes , that would not only be amusing , it would be artistic , it would be spiritual .
nobody remembers it .
he was going to succeed .
that story doesnt hold water .
i expect there are a good many family trusts and things like that .
if youd listen to what you are told the colour surged up into edwards neck .
she repeated in muted tones the final phrase of dictation before the interruption .
it reminds me of nothing so much as a round game i was recently persuaded to play by some young friends during the christmas season .
how did she come to slip up ?
armstrong chatted instead of the weather and of fishing .
you telephoned last night .
we know what thyrza grey says she can do .
he followed the others out of the room , banging the door behind him .
asked graves .
miss bulstrode waved that aside impatiently .
she has an exquisite taste and flair for beautiful things and shares my passion for chinese art .
will eberhard have it , or sir oswald coote ?
it is so easy to be an americanhere in paris !
at last they got out into the hall .
that , thought frankie , was the question .
the murderer is still here .
it looks to me he broke off and began gnawing at his nailsa habit he had when anxious .
oh , said joanna , i think its a photograph of a diseased spleen or something .
then she spoke .
there is henet .
yes , thats what i mean .
and shes very striking-looking , handsome and with quite a presence .
miss waterhouse reflected .
that is to say i looked across towards this house .
i have lost no button , monsieur , he said .
bill went with him and they returned with a tray of glasses , siphons and other necessaries of life .
he says he spent that hour typing in his room , and it seems quite clear that he was typing in his room .
he can assume any part he pleases .
i could not .
oliver continued to sob .
barford and i started at once .
its so odd , thomas , the way he died .
the squadron leader blushed and admitted rather shamefacedly : well , she has a way with her .
i see he stopped suddenly .
and yet philip lombard , his lips curling back from his teeth said : and yetthats just it !
youre just the wife rowley needs .
on the other hand , it may be that the name ascher was a coincidencethat the victim this time , no matter what her name is , will again be an old woman who keeps a shop .
it would set her up nicely .
are shots such a usual occurrence ?
he sat pulling absentmindedly at a little moustache while he looked at mr .
they have not , it seems , a hercule poirot .
at least nobodys come down here in the last two years .
again mr clancy chuckled .
the duchess had made a special point of it and had added that henry banks would be there .
well , said colonel johnson , i think thats all for the present .
for a moment , a grin appeared upon stephen restaricks handsome face .
van der halt , the wall street millionaire .
hengrave who lived here !
i dont think i could say it myselfmy throats not made that way .
smart of you , superintendent .
if his wife had gone away and left a note on the pincushion , it would be the first hed know of anything of that kind .
can you shoot , mr starkwedder ?
and what i say is .
french governess in the house , french stranger outside .
i think it was the one they call carola very nice-looking girlso like her brotherreally they might be twins .
i meanyou were the next on the listor however you arrange these things ?
so nick said .
she said with a certain amount of gusto , the triangles going strong !
sir charles went out on the terrace with them and offered the loan of an electric torch to help them down the stony path .
my silly prejudice against him has quite vanished .
youre fairly sure about him , arent you ?
and had it ?
lombard , can i speak to you for a minute ?
i dont quite see the point , said bunch .
until i have read the memoirs i do not know , explained the baron simply .
but the figure and the colouring are very good , better than any of the others .
one is human after all !
yes , a detail , as you say .
i spoke it colloquially but , of course , entirely by ear , and the words t and tait sounded exactly the same to me : i spelt it one way or the other purely by chance , hoping i might have hit upon the right one .
oh , i dont really think so .
julia seemed a little startled by the idea .
someone stepped on it .
i might find ways of whistling derek back to you , but it would all come to the same in the end .
iii when nurse hopkins , pleasantly stimulated by tea and romantic speculation , finally left the house , mary gerrard ran out of the door to overtake her .
they waited on the first floor outside mr farley ' s door- which was the customary place for people to wait who had an appointment with mr farley .
it was a glorious meal .
is it your idea that in the end we debunk all this ?
nice as its been to see you , what id really like you to do now is to go away .
so am i , said miss barrow .
she let me in and showed me where the set was , and stayed there while i was working on it .
just for a minute or two .
she wasnt a patient there !
her lips quivered .
he said she was persecuting him and following him and that she was a spy for another nation .
no , i cant say it is .
come to _num_ lizzard street , s .
shes quite a character , though , is aunt effie .
but listen .
what he needs is sympathy .
oh , your fat friend who writes the books about the unpronounceable finn .
in fact , said weston , the idea is that mr .
i gather we are going to a place callednow wait a minute , what was it called ?
i went out , banging the door .
that was the chief .
it was written on cheap lined paper in an uneducated hand .
her original murder had proved a bitter disappointment .
that story of my writing a book on folklore didnt take you in for a moment , i suppose ?
no longer of importance .
there , also , his manner was perfectly normal .
they cant have vanished into thin air !
and they werent actually here in woodleigh common .
iv there was a silence in the room .
oh , yes , he said , hes not listening .
the old boy didnt turn up , is that it ?
theres no earthly reason why i shouldnt be .
but the fact remains he is not one of the family .
well , i hardly know about that mr .
she had hardly exchanged a word so far with professor wanstead .
miss marple couldnt help thinking that it all looked terribly depraved .
its sosenseless .
collapsed utterly , he did .
but like all the irish , i like fighting .
my father was to make a brilliant but unhappy marriage .
thats what she got by it , and thats why she did itif she did it .
it is a possible contingency , madame .
but the important thing is still the innocent ; those who live sincerely and fearlessly in the present age , who demand that they should be protected and saved from harm .
he said : got the gin and the vermouth .
the man was a scoundrel .
he had been running and was slightly out of breath .
tim nugent looked after her with a faint frown .
two yearsclose on two years agoand that strange little man this morning with his patent leather shoes and his big moustaches , had brought it back to him , asking all those questions .
oh well , one hears of things like that every day .
hubbards daughter .
the interesting point to me is that when dr .
i came up for an art class at the tate this morning .
we will take a taxi , said poirot , waving his stick .
and the boy , like the proud young fool that he was , remained silent , disdaining to protest his innocence in the face of his fathers disbelief .
' ' know what ?
less risky in all probability than one shot would have been .
he was lying on his back ?
well , dear , said miss marple , it is much easier for me sitting here quietly than it was for youand being an artist you are so susceptible to atmosphere , arent you ?
i could not but suspect that he was making a deliberate excuse to get rid of me .
my name is monica deane .
i do , said tuppence .
he said , grudgingly : i suppose she does , in a way , but not well .
hes sorry for me .
shes a very pretty little thingquite charming with the most lovely big wistful eyes .
what have you done with the ether , sister ?
but i cant see him as the lunatic mr .
colonel johnson said : you mean , i take it , mrs .
perhaps it may have been partly because she was , in spite of everything , lonely .
he stated definitely that no news of any kind had come from tommy .
the only feasible thing seems to be a process of elimination , he said .
my dear lady , you take my breath away .
yet my parents were far too kind to tell me frankly that they couldnt be bothered to come up every night .
id say didnt care much for her mother who sounds a grim woman by all accountsthe self-righteous martyr type .
he looks a little pale already .
i dont think i like this lipstick , she announced presently .
i told hubert i should change him .
minutes passed .
too long ago for you , said miss marple .
there is still the chance that dr .
why , she thought , had she let so long a time go by ?
and have her fears ridiculed ?
inspector neele looked at her with interest .
i told her to move into a better house and to buy herself any additional furniture she wanted .
try to remember where you placed itwhere you saw it last ?
tact and firmness .
i much regretted .
laura looked at him .
the last of the baronetsthats his nickname .
i think , therefore , that anyone might realise that the business that brought him must definitely be urgent business , but i still think that the normal assumption would be that it was a business visit , and that the matterhowever urgentwould be a trust matter .
no , but seriously , have you ever failed ?
she was old , with a great deal of untidy grey hair .
of course , it maynt be .
but you dont catch me believing that stuff .
superstition !
it was finally arranged that i should join suzanne , wherever she was , and devote all my energies to taking care of myself .
nobodys asked me , mind you .
but the vividness with which they assumed concrete reality interested him .
but we must be more intelligent .
he appeared on the grass sward , looking this way and that .
i much disliked his first suggestion , which was to take about twenty years off poirots age , call him beau poirot and have lots of girls in love with him .
but the murder charge is more tricky .
two or three after every meal .
poirot is discretion itself .
oh , thats quite all right , said miss marple .
i seem to have taken dolly whatsernames character away for good , but i daresay she deserves it , and that charming idiot of a woman will never wonder why , if i wanted carstairs address , i didnt simply ring up and ask for it !
but he was just saying that somebody or otherwinterton , at leastseemed to think youd been up to something .
just drink it up .
i worked with him on this project .
finally he laughed and sat down again .
six months already , i mused , and where are we ?
well , i put two and two together .
got it , he said .
no soak-the-rich tactics would have any effect on him .
the model gave a coquettish little giggle .
once let him accept that view and all would be well .
i never do !
lemoine hit the table sharply with his hand .
possibly they assumed that she , like themselves , was a witness to be questioned .
perhaps youd care to come down to the station ?
morley was a small man with a decided jaw and a pugnacious chin .
erwe havent met before , i think ?
the servants dont like you asking them their ages .
well , he said thoughtfully .
he interfered with you that night as you were looking for the jewel .
he opened the desk drawers very softly .
good sporting instincts , that old bean .
satterthwaite , that a dash of brilliant colour had caught his eye .
not that i expect i shall find any in town .
he and the car matched each other .
when one servant goes , you get another .
her mania grew stronger and she began to believe it her duty to rid the world of certain personspossibly what is termed unfortunate females .
what have you done to edward ?
yes , it is a droll farce , is it not ?
frankly , i funked it !
feel as though id known you all my life .
a cry burst from my lips .
i dare say it soon will be .
molly came towards him , but , almost unconsciously , he put her aside .
and from them she turned to a contemplation of mrs .
asked poirot sympathetically .
you know i dont .
elsie .
he stole up behind him as he was writing and shot him through the head .
' that is what i say .
somewhat unwillingly , tommy moved aside .
very annoying for you .
my word , he usually looks a twerp !
and the only real proof you had , miss marple , was a schoolgirls bitten nails .
at least , as a matter of fact , i just looked in on kencaptain marshall .
oliver had felt when she first sent for him .
but what a very unpleasant man .
i think youre rather insulting .
there was a mirror in her hand .
sir oswald turned to the other two .
rt _num_ .
my name is lamb , yes , but i work in an entirely different department .
it went on .
but as soon as i do get back , the first thing i shall do will be to come and see you and ask you to marry me .
he said quickly : philip ?
and you are sure that it was not yours ?
theyre born that way .
inglethorps bell wire was neatly cut , and on monday evening mademoiselle cynthia was spending the night with friends , so that mrs .
it was then that an idea came to me .
thinks im too much of an idiot , i suppose .
you see now why i drew attention to the reticence of your manuscript , murmured poirot .
you must be the girls father , she said to him .
she told no one else .
there , there .
i dare say you wont believe this , said gwenda , speaking very fast .
i leave the matter in your hands .
luke felt like an actor who does not know his cue .
each side went down in turn .
she smiled suddenlya gentle , pitying , incredulous smile .
if i get stories told to me rather often , i dont really mind hearing them again because ive usually forgotten them .
crme de cacao ?
epsteins statues , i believe .
rosamund nodded .
married people do best alone together when theyre starting , my mother said .
never did i imagine the magistrate cut her short .
must you sneer ?
goodnight , miss dawes .
such women naturally revolt from the idea of marriage .
curse murgatroyd , said miss hinchcliffe , she hasnt given em their corn .
neither shall i forget you , madame , poirot declared gallantly as he kissed her hand .
but the probabilities lie that waymental instability , desertion from the army , psychiatrists report .
grainger were allies of long-standing .
you will come , then ?
well , ill tell you one thing that might , as i say , help your point of view .
i know what hospital nurses are .
the murder of roger ackroyd was also the first of agatha christies works to be dramatizedas alibiand to have a successful run in londons west end .
the valet , cried mr .
she had done so before colonel clapperton left the boat this morning .
the brief inquest was overadjourned for a fortnight .
allo , he said .
nobody here took any interest in him .
well , as a matter of fact the spences like dancing together .
one day , rather injudiciously , i thought , mrs .
but shewellimagines things , you know .
you know , when they are forty or fifty or that sort of age and they suddenly want to begin a new life .
very trying for you , maam , im sure , said the cleaning woman with sympathy .
that must have been about twenty minutes before my arrival here , he calculated .
i went straight to the point .
van aldin , he said .
theyre all local , too .
in english or in french ?
children have their own ideas about toys .
with that face ?
to begin with , the key was in henry bassington-ffrenchs pocket who found it there ?
the mother , added leo dryly , was unable to say .
they want me to make a statement .
ive no doubt he was with them the greater part of the evening .
the travellers got out of the car .
and he got a job in this respectable but rather obscure little chemists shop .
they drove , not towards the village , but towards the downs .
he was looking a little white about the gills , but he was still the perfect servant .
adelaide said with a sigh : i suppose one cant blame her for that .
he said : she is an odd woman .
because you were frightened ?
it is a question of sudden and mysterious death .
particulars ?
my death doesnt lie at your door .
no one could be more considerate .
) really , of course , its ridiculous .
edmund looked at him curiously .
blackberries discolour the teeth the corpses teeth were not discoloured , and yet henry gascoigne ate blackberries at the gallant endeavour that night .
i dont really know the colours of things very well .
oh just one .
his eyes glittered behind thick lenses as hi suspiciously at his visitor .
along the terrace , then down the slope towards the seaobliquelyto the end of the island where loose rocks went out into the water .
ive said ill see to it .
the two other women dispensers , but they have no connection of any kind with hickory road .
she returned to wilbraham and took him up to the second floor , where she had a tiny bedroom and sitting room .
the comrades of peace .
the eyes under the bushy eyebrows looked at him sharply .
emily brent said : thank you .
that must be that can only be the point of the keeping of the letter .
on it were laid out a small pistol , a piece of lead piping with a rusty sinister stain on it , a blue bottle labelled poison , a length of clothesline and a hypodermic syringe .
she was going in to the fortune teller when i saw her , said weyman .
crazy about me one minute , tired of me the next !
how am i to get hold of that scoundrel who drove her to death as surely as if hed killed her ?
wales somewhere .
a uniformed attendant whisked her up in a lift and decanted her on a smart new mat outside a bright green door .
then she looked straight ahead of her .
we know he fought in the war and received a slight wound in the head and that he was discharged from the army owing to epilepsy .
but then the evidence she stopped .
i really know so little about her .
it was all so dramatic , you know .
there was always his photograph , you see .
poirot transferred his gaze from the young man to his older companion .
he ' s terribly good-looking .
cinderella married the prince , you remember .
if simeon lee had died before her mother , her mothers share would have come down to her (unless her mother willed it otherwise) , but as jennifer estravados predeceased simeon lee , that particular legacy reverts to the other members of the family .
you were quite satisfied ?
deirdre shook her head , pleading a headache , and she thought to herself : that settles it .
what of the relations of the poor young lady ?
nobody ever sees him .
poirot crossed the room to her .
at a place called shipton bois in suffolk .
he is still at the villa marguerite .
about one ten the boy came up and knocked .
' turning to mrs farley , poirot asked : ' you permit that i ring for your butler ?
she told me that she decided to stay in the house that night because in her own phrase she thought something was up .
supposing that presently nurse obrien goes into the box and swears that you said you had probably left it at home ?
susan said slowly , its a letter that uncle richard wrote to cora after hed been down here to see her .
she was a good girl , florrie , but inclined to be taken in by a gentlemanly appearance .
clapped into a lunatic asylum , poor girl , said mrs .
he came to them almost at once .
hope we can put on a good show for you .
he says hes never seen the girl in his life .
the door again opened and mrs .
however , megans lucky star was in the ascendant .
reggie still hesitated , then he turned and walked slowly to the door .
he said as he had said so many times : you must do as you please , rachel .
yesand women .
he said his mother had given the money to him , but both mr .
i expect he will .
that dress i had on last night was one of hers .
you do not mind my joining you , i hope , he said in english .
ii thought wed do it that way .
at present , no , said poirot , but i may have news awaiting me at my hotel .
they went along the passage , opening various doors .
after that , all is simple .
all weve got to do now is to have all your things collected and sent to you athave you got anywhere to stay , by the way ?
he is about sixty , i suppose , so that he will be looking about for a nice sweet young thing like me .
afterwards , when we got home , my mother said to me crossly .
i think that he will turn up at your office , on the pretext of a case which he will wish you to take up , and will try you with the pass words .
had been my constant demandand at last the great day came .
alfred said : you dont knowyou c-c-cant imaginewhat it m-m-means to me .
he has no secret papers or documents .
colonel luttrell spent much time in his wifes bedroom .
nine dr .
tony has a flea .
why do you come here ahead of your people , to give me what seems to be a warning it is a warning .
were not sure yet , said johnson .
yes , but i cant remember what it was .
hes an unmitigated little bounder !
it was unfair .
he said : you ought to have it .
allerton said something of the kind , i said resentfully .
i askedi couldnt bear it .
was that will a forgery ?
never , monsieur .
shes an exceedingly clever young woman .
david never speaks if he can help it .
where had she seen him before ?
its been present in my mind all along .
miss waynflete said earnestly : i dont think you realize that heshes a very clever man .
audrey nodded .
he kept the knowledge to himself , but when he said to me slyly that there would always be folliats at nasse house , that was his own private joke .
i dreamt of it .
isnt there another pub round here ?
the girl frowned .
her mother was left a widow early in life and caroline was devoted to her mother .
if so , which of them ?
the child jennifer was very vague .
the house is ready for occupation .
the same voice , with the same deadly quiet .
i wasnt any good at acting .
he said : i wish i saw you more often , midge , my dear .
poirot said with a sigh : alas , the proverb is true .
inglethorp retired to her boudoir again .
but certainly , said poirot .
im as strong as a bull .
you have produced evidence that he was planning to pay .
in the circumstances , mr .
good , you say , i will kill her .
spells at the turn of the moon .
ill speak to her , roger .
the death of m .
when she had gone on her way miss marple shook her head very gently and frowned .
you notice it when you fall over it and swear at it , and you give it a vague pat sometimes when it presents itself to be patted .
shes got five of them , you know .
i reflected sadly that i had no one to keep my hand in with .
tell me , does her letter not fit in perfectly with these facts ?
and cold , said tim with a slight shiver .
i was lunching with a woman the other day and i admired a ring she had ona big emerald .
' _num_ ' curious .
they keep the lot .
lupton , who she knew had something to do with the local childrens hospital , i wonder if you want any extra childrens books .
a sudden fit of anger , a violent emotion after a heavy dinner , cest entendu then , with an access of rage , the blood flies to the head , and pst !
tuppence announced him , and mrs .
detective inspector hardcastle .
poirot said : you think definitely that blatt is the murderer ?
max repeated patiently that he was sorry ; it had not occurred to him that they would be alarmed .
she said : so youve noticed that ?
later in the day ?
he thinks it was letters only and no parcel at the cottagebut he isnt sure .
the murderer snatched it away and never noticed hed left a corner of it behind .
ive hardly seen him for the last month .
he bent and whispered mysteriously in mollys ear , i may have a few embarrassments in the near futurebut i am confident i can arrange matters , and if you should receive a casewith a goose , say , a turkey , some tins of foie gras , a hamsome nylon stockings , yes ?
once you get all the facts behind the case , and you can usually get all that from the servants .
but it wouldnt , he reflected suddenly , be at all like that because owing to a slightly strained wrist , gerda would have to drive , and gerda , god help her , had never been able to begin to drive a car !
milly merton , i declare !
a pleasant amiable boy , with no more than his fair share of conceit , not brilliant intellectually perhaps , but an excellent type of the ordinary upper-class young englishman .
there are , you know , police regulationsvery stupid , very tiresome , but necessaryfor a foreigner in this country .
the mistress ?
poirot bowed at the compliment .
didnt you hear the way she hissed i am tosca ?
theres your birthmark , though , if that satisfies you better .
taverner said : we will give you a receipt for this , mr .
alfred belonged to an archery clubalfred was meant to take the blame .
he considered the word .
his life or his family or any personal friends that he had .
exit clarissa mysteriously , she declaimed in a dramatic stage whisper as she disappeared into the recess , a split second before henry ushered the prime minister into the drawing-room .
blind with tears , she stumbled down the steps .
or dont , as the case may be , said charles .
wouldnt it be better to vary them a little ?
they were green like a cats .
well , just a bit of luck , i saw just the name i wanted over a butchers shop .
ill never forget when i came into that room and saw you sitting there .
perhaps that could have been a guest in the house , sergeant cadwallader suggested helpfully .
a faint sound made race look over lucillas head at the open doorway .
then mixed bathing was allowed on the more aristocratic meadfoot beach .
all our murders have beenwell , private murders , so to speak .
she was still asleep when i left , said frankie .
they must have been alarmed by his failure to come out of the trance , and carried him out into the open air .
good god , i cried , springing up , you dare to think sit down , hastings , said poirot autocratically .
ive got some patients to see .
rather embarrassing , but that was all .
clarissa stood thinking .
he knew now what mr .
i nearly went , i tell you .
he arranged that she should divorce him and that he would take the blame .
whatever you have is just the best of its kind , not so much because it is the best , but because there is no reason if you like or want any particular thing , why you shouldnt have it .
bradley had frequently had to cope .
we do know one thingthat when david lee stood by his fathers dead body , some part of him was appeased and satisfied .
' ' well , it does not escape me that the friends of madame are always soldiers or sailors or airmen .
i fell deeply in lovenot with rudolf rassendyll , as might have been expected , but with the real king imprisoned in his dungeon and sighing .
if she had , she never mentioned them .
horbury cried out : i hope you dont think , sir , that i had anything to do with it !
she added : i am very sorry for george .
ive got a head .
oh , but she is .
albert stretched up , overdid his armful , and catriona fell more or less on tuppences head .
besides , on that very day , she went into a nursing home to have her appendix out .
arrangements have to be made .
so there is , i said .
you dont miss much , mam , he said .
i dont , and when i tell you that there is something very wrong in that house , she pointed up the hill , i mean that there is something tangibly wrong ; its not just an echo of the past .
of courseof course .
i would have been quite happy if she had stayed longer .
well , as i say , i expected to find a put-up job .
then he set to work systematically to search all the pockets .
assault and battery .
and really , when he was annoyed , timothy could become quite unreasonable .
halfway along the drive a path branched off through some shrubbery .
the woods with their autumnal tints are so perfect at this time of year .
hercule poirot , said number four in a mocking tone .
i gather somebody who had come across his wife in wartime had told him that his wife had said she was living at sutton chancellor .
i do know about that sort of thing and how difficult it is .
no , i dont think there was anything in particular .
we had had a momentary respite from emotion whilst we talked the situation out , but it was on us again now .
that seems very pointless .
they wanted to send me to a doctor , and then ill be shut up in one of those loony places and they wont let me out again .
think youll be able to identify him , sir ?
and they either wont speak at all , or else are very loud and contradictory .
he went up to his room and lay down for an hour or two before dressing for dinner .
a chance sentence caught my eye and .
elise .
she had gambled on that , and succeeded .
i am trying to reconstruct a story the story as it must be .
with the loss of her boy , something had hardened in hersome ordinary common kindness had dried up .
good morning , madame .
what time yesterday was this ?
my attention was caught first by clotilde .
but you say you didnt go into the house ?
there was a gloating cruelty , an evil satisfaction in his face .
i dont think it was anything except a silly practical joke .
sharpe consulted his notebook .
he paused , waiting for a reaction .
you think , said poirot , that when a b c finds out his mistake he might try again ?
and , on the baser side , your vanitythrough association with me you have learned all the tricks of the trade !
in the living room giving on the garden was a couch , and on it was lying an elderly lady with a thin wrinkled face and with one of the sharpest and most interrogative noses that emily had ever seen .
what time was it when de sousa arrived ?
one of the few that can descend in the female line .
but if so , he must have come to the ball prepared to kill his victim .
six or seven men were sitting easily around a table and each of those six men was a man of some importance in his own line .
lisa whats-her-name , the austrian girl ; shed worked on it with him .
my darling loraine , i will be down on wednesday .
i mean who and what and why ?
and why did you ask for the original of carlotta adams letter ?
i should like it to be us .
i chose to go the way i wanted .
took it very hard , she did .
and then i saw your advertisement .
v i did not see poirot again until the following morning .
i dont suppose you know my name .
poirot explained that he must see mrs .
victoria , fresh from the soothing charm of his manner , shook her head .
i called sharply to judith and she looked up , surprised .
you were not living there , i think ?
her heart beating violently , renisenb drew out a necklace of gold beads with gold lions in front .
i like the dresser and the plates , and i simply love the lavish feeling that an absolutely enormous kitchen range gives youthough , of course , im thankful i havent got to cook on it .
extraordinarily convenient .
over the meal as outlined by poirot , the little belgian produced the little black memorandum book .
dacres that she would think it over before making a final choice .
she was full of lamentations over imhoteps departure .
papopolous coldly .
oh yes , dr graham .
her ladyship had a cat , sir .
that was his medical opinion as well as his personal one .
usually after dinner , monsieur .
well be along .
but there were advantages , were there ?
he was shivering now , his hands were cold and lifeless .
youve had it all .
i dont think , said mr .
emmas no fool .
so have i for that matter , but i flatter myself that my choice of dishes was more judicious than yours .
theresas got expensive tastes .
really a most interesting morning , she said .
kennedy standing by the mantelpiece , pulling his grizzled moustache and looking troubled .
cust said to himself : hercule poirot .
he pointed out of the window .
then why did he twice attempt to take my life ?
they resisted the coconuts and went on to the bran tub .
my family , of course , laugh uproariously whenever i say that i was a lovely girl .
the idea of the murderer was quite plainly to incriminate her .
crossfield , you say , is attending to your wife .
that was the way amyas crales mind worked .
hes for it !
she wrenched her hand away quickly .
all the language is very technical .
his painting was the dearest thing in life to him .
it was as yet a small black dot far-off on the track .
ive never seen much of the world , you know .
the association seems clear .
iid just thrown myself at his head .
i knew of what he was thinkingthat strange affair at fernley park .
the elder womans swift appraising glance that went on lightly to another old friend .
' you had another daughter once .
no , i threw it away .
finally , she came to a neat wooden gate and , striking a match , saw tudor cottage written on it .
and yet , twelve years earlier , the husband had shot the wife , and then himselfor perhaps it was the other way around , since sets of both of their fingerprints were on the gun , and the gun had fallen between them .
he turned to tommy .
jean dupont and miss jane grey .
where did i slip up ?
what you have given birth towhat you have made come to life , you should not destroy .
rose softened and capitulated .
eliza .
more than we have , you and i ?
she thanked miss gorringe again and rang off .
i wonder how much of the money he has spent .
they cant see it as amusing or as a novelty like we do .
but if anne meredith had been unhappy , she could have left as her predecessors had done .
anyway at all .
do you not then think that it is only too likely your daughter may have joined him ?
you are a cleverer man than i am , japp .
but there were only two other people in the room , mr .
but lifes very shattering , dont you think ?
rhoda wriggled on her chair in a paroxysm of embarrassment .
you play the bridge , hastings .
to be a little lady was well rammed home in those times .
chapmans address booka dentist was the only person who could prove definitely who the dead woman wasor was not .
the butcher had been known to ring up just before nine if some crisis in the meat trade had occurred .
oliver looked at him doubtfully .
he begged earnestly that any further development might be reported to him .
a cynical smile creased the majors lips .
suddenly he uttered an ejaculation of delight and held up a blue envelope with a russian stamp on it .
you did not look .
there is a place called the felsenlabyrinthall big boulders piled about in a most fantastic waya path winds through them .
quin , smiling , what it is all about ?
as proprietor of the daffodil coaches , it should be easy enough .
hercule poirot nodded his head .
and my objections were conscientious .
back for your life .
his mouth fell open .
one would think she would be certain to mention something casually .
he appreciated the fact that , if linnet doyle was set upon anything , that thing had to happen .
she doesnt seem to me verymalleable , said lady tamplin , rather hesitating to choose the right word .
as scribe i have dealt with all the accounts .
ive been on the boards since i was a kid of sixtumbling .
for some reason he looked again at the scarecrow .
the last link in the chainthat fragment of the daily leader .
jacko , whose father was serving a prison sentence and whose mother had gone off with some other man .
quin had that effect upon him .
sandra replied quietly , he suggests that the associations of the restaurant must be overcome .
quite a high rent there .
renaulds murder ?
he walked slowly along the street carrying his bag and revolving perplexities in his mind .
you passed first into deep gloom : a big lounge and dining-room , with curtains permanently drawn .
she didnt come down here under her own name because of the disgusting way people talk and gossip .
broadmoor , not hanging .
she was sitting dry-eyed at a desk in the morning room on which were strewn various papers .
that will suit me quite well .
and then he went further than he had any right to go , talked about her stealing down at night and getting out of the house to meet some fellow or other .
and too much fine language .
theyd got on well together from the beginning .
she danced it with michael novgin .
just the man i wanted to get hold of .
bradleys consulting room manner was perfect .
do you mean you want us to dump the body in the wood ?
two naval officers , two military gentlemen , some photographs of naked babies sprawling on rugs .
was not to be told anything .
there were piles of books perched on every shelf or table .
but , on the facts , not impossible ?
annes left hand tightened on the basketwork of her chair .
and she was strange about something too .
barbara had the grace to look at least a trifle embarrassed .
jane went out to meet him .
i lay back in a chair and gave myself up to dreaming .
stay where you are , he commanded , and the men stopped obediently .
which simplifies matters very much , murmured the lawyer .
as soon as dr .
i dont know whether you would like us to pay it into your bank or whether you would like to consult us possibly as to the investment of it ?
i cant keep them waiting .
she would see better presently .
no , i didnt want to know that .
hardcastle turned it over .
voil , murmured poirot .
either of them may have had a grudge , may have brooded perhaps the first young man may have had some unsatisfactory mental history .
it was at the time of the terrible struggle in france between church and state .
welman said : if roddy cares for you just a little more than you care for himwell , thats all to the good .
he began to shake nervously .
he was , he said , himself convinced that her death was due to the withholding of a restorative drug by a married couple who attended on her and who stood to benefit very substantially by her death .
colemans manner rather more like a p .
whats the matter with your head ?
you should have told me !
that led easily to fifth column activities .
hercule poirot , i called other witnesses to prove beyond any reasonable doubt that the girl mary gerrard was the illegitimate daughter of laura welman .
no suspicion attaches to her .
they looked at each other with worried faces .
well , i was just wondering yes ?
indeed .
well , said miss blacklock , im as much in the dark as you are .
but they wont let us go , my dear .
but its also worth reading for the sheer skill with which christie plays with her readers expectations and uses them to play the cleverest of narrative tricks with us .
inspector grange laid the revolver on the desk in front of sir henry and looked at him expectantly .
and all the while that this agonized questioning went on within him , he talked flippantly to conrad , enraging the cross-grained doorkeeper to the point of homicidal mania .
no mouse in that mousehole , i said , remembering a metaphor of poirots on one past occasion .
i mean , it was not a family council or anything of that kind .
im telling you everythingi took a little pistol i had in the war with me .
he was watching her with a vague kind of pain .
i guess im ashamed to admit it , but i came over here determined to find her and fix it all up , and take her back as mrs .
you knew i hated you and you enjoyed it .
loved i not honour more .
but was that true ?
shall we , perhaps , have a little drink ?
nowadays we do know why .
commonly known as pongo .
because mr .
canon prescott , that genial kindly man .
one must always proceed with method .
hercule poirot stayed behind .
she listened and occasionally spoke a brief word .
there is some good prewar whisky if you think he would prefer that .
really rather a coincidence that there should be a morris oxford car of the right colour with the number just one digit wrong , and with a man in it closely resembling the owner of the car .
and that picture means somethingis in some way a menace to someone .
some ulterior motive ?
then she said : it fits in with two things .
sit down on the dibs and refuse to part .
no reason he should have had anything to do with it .
i glanced at the paper , but there was little news in it beyond the fact that michael setons death was now definitely confirmed .
things dont always happen fairly , ruth .
gwenda said : you advised us oncedo you remember ?
no , of course you do not see .
well just send him nice copies of them , and tell him this is exactly what he did say at the time , and that weve got it in writing .
love does .
thats odd thought he came up with us .
ill tell it to you on the way to exhampton .
infinite , that is the answer .
she was only seventeen and he was a married man years older than her .
giving us a cold look , she demanded : wheres my auntie punkie ?
this is a terrible business , miss buckley , said the inspector .
someone who is truly devoted to your interests ?
derek looked round sharply .
oh dear , aunt jane !
i havent read anything about it .
it has pockets .
if i am not too late , hastings .
some of us can be called civilized still , i suppose ?
if its any consolation to you , mr .
ive missed what i ought to have had .
how with this .
joanna farleys voice broke in .
she looked both sulky and bad-tempered .
regrettablebut necessary .
well , i should like to know , mr .
and here are balloons of every colour all ready to blow up !
on the one side was the railway embankment , on the other was a high wall which enclosed some tall factory buildings .
well of course i see what you mean .
mary mead , she had relapsed into a period of orthodox church-of-england beliefs .
a plain girl , beryl , but damned efficient .
well , here it is !
eighteen i sir henry clithering said : speaking as watson , i want to know your methods , miss marple .
what had this young woman been doing in the sports pavilion ?
stone , said the lady .
but i always had the devils own temper .
wondering , still dazed with sleep , she obeyed .
of course im years too old for her .
tredwell stretched out a detaining hand .
yes , i dont know why youd want to go and move .
but why did you anticipate an attack on her ?
if i may know , he added apologetically .
he sipped his whisky and soda appreciatively .
a face or a mannerism , a way of talking , a way of walking , a gesture .
knees together , toes turned in .
the police will know all about archer soon enough , i said .
we want to know where we are in this business .
as a matter of fact , i believe theres quite a simple explanation .
there was nothing in the shop worth such a large sum of money .
one expected to hear that london was bombed that first night .
' ' no .
bring him in here .
that , i confess , i do not know .
here , sir , usually .
no , you are not to leave .
perhaps he was trying to lure her up there with his charm , and he would then knock her on the head .
she mustwhat was it ?
a remarkable man .
he didnt know till afterwards , said bundle .
hed say anything with a little leading .
may the god ptah gladden your heart as one who lives long .
vandemeyer pulled herself together and tried to resume her former manner .
so many ideas on the same subject differ .
one walks with the dogs and the guns , and the dogs , they put up the gameit flies out of the woods , up into the air and you go bang bang .
i ought to be able to prevent it happeningif one ever can ah !
ingrid says you dont have meals at a particular time , you just have them when theyre ready .
i never meet people , growled bristow .
i hammered on the counter and waited a bit .
will you come and speak with mr .
one or two , said poirot modestly .
yes , charles was the only son of reubens sister .
there isnt any young spragge .
try to hold up , mother , urged her husband .
ten minutes later a car arrived with an inspector and a constable and an elderly man who had his profession stamped all over him .
as she did so her hand encountered something hard and rectangular under the mattress .
they had been , on the whole , seventeen happy and peaceful years , in spite of the sorrow occasioned by the death of her son robin .
i remembered another evening when three of us had walked at night .
colonel kingston bruce rushed at him and shook him warmly by the hand .
does this mean anything to you ?
bland looked puzzled .
poirot , and see what you can find out about them by just looking ?
they took no interest in the nun .
nobody can go into the house , do you hear that ?
_num_ opened and mrs .
i knew id got to be quick .
one day as i drove through mosul in the lorry , the policeman directing traffic suddenly held it all up with his baton , and yelling out , mama !
oh , maam , she wailed , dont dwell on such things .
i dont see what there is to talk about , she said .
now , then , my lad , said slack , i want a little information from you .
kill lucky ?
oh , he said , ii didnt .
oh , it was very fancy .
i trust and pray not , but it might be within the bound of possibility .
isnt it even possible , asked philip , that one might see things in better proportion looking back after the lapse of years ?
i had a yen for her at one time , yes , he admitted .
i do think , camilla , that it mightsimplify things .
whatever else happens , ive got you , havent i ?
what shall he do ?
we can tell better , of course , after the next crime for gods sake , thompson , dont speak so glibly of the next crime , said sir lionel irritably .
actually he barely listened .
i taxed him with it then , and he laughed and said : nothing venture , nothing have !
lancastersmiling happily , contentedlya woman pursuing her appointed task , with gentle reasonableness .
no , there isnt .
he exclaimed in disgust .
for megan had wandered away a few minutes previously and was now standing aimlessly in the middle of a patch of lawn looking not unlike a meditative bird waiting for nourishment .

it was as though someone had scribbled a phrase of music with a somewhat inadequate pencil .

then he lowered his eyes .
fortescue returns to the house before you arrive , what do you want me to tell her ?

her eyes met mine serenely .
the room is at the end of a passage .
you will talk to her , poirot ordered , because you are already friends , and you will go again and see this blind woman with some excuse .
a young man with nice manners and a taste for luxury and no brains and no enterprise , and if there is anything that is a softer job than being secretary to a millionaire it is marrying a rich woman for her money .

what would they want with two country places ?
ah yes , supposing you do ?
youve got to see the scene of the crime , havent you ?
he queried , eyeing jane doubtfully .
shed had all the proper governesses and ladies maids and scholastic advantages and if she wanted to go to europe , why not ?
whywhats happened ?
the face towels had been excellent value and just what margaret wanted , the space gun for robby and the rabbit for jean were highly satisfactory , and that evening coatee was just the thing she herself needed , warm but dressy .
ive got fond of that boy .
ackroyd , raymond , and i kept the conversation going .
i went across to pull him out , of course , but just as i got there i saw the glint of the wristwatch .
now , whowho ?
i am an expert .
again the senior partner of carmichael , grant & carmichael uttered his characteristic grunt .
said they were a b right enough .
he may have been up to some funny business or other , but not necessarily murder .
i dont think he believed me .
on one particular evening in early june , he arrived about half past eight and settled down to a comfortable discussion on the cheery topic of the prevalence of arsenical poisoning in crimes .
yet how on earth could mr .
poirot here we shant be long , he said cheerfully .
was this a strange manifestation of postmortem jealousy ?
not henet more than another .
edward turned an inquiring head .
no , dear , i didnt mean that at all .
there are very sad things in the world .
i think in the end she hated her .
the other nodded approvingly .
but in the doorway itself she came face to face with mr .
a beautiful girl , but her mental balance was doubtful .
and he was proud , too , proud as lucifer .
inquiries of the dignified tredwell showed him the way to the schoolroom .
mildreds not very happy , either , is she ?
he said once that she gave him kippers much too oftenand once he said his landlady was upset because she had lost her cat .
its funny , but i havent lost my looks a bit .
she hoped the crime would not be found out for some time but in the meantime she spread abroad rumours of nora broad having been seen about in michaels car , going about with michael .
so you see , do you not , miss marple , that im a very sad and unhappy man .
i threw it up to him .
it is a pity .
i wasnt afraid of anyone .
asked the other curiously .
they had crossed the garden and passed through a palisaded gate and had come to the entrance gate which eric gulbrandsen had erected as an entrance to his college , a sturdily built , hideous , red brick building .
the scotland yard man was obviously contemptuous , major norman was bored and impatient , and i myself found the time passed with wearisome slowness .
i am a private detective sent for by your master before he died .
treves knew then that camilla was going to be murdered ?
none of them sounds right .
im bleeding over the beans .
a samovar stood upon a table .
ipys demands and importunities were put aside with more sharpness than usual .
let us hear your views ?
he crossed the room quietly and sat down in the chair opposite her .
parker pyne were the two miss pryces .
ill let you know when theres anything definite .
now , as i say , if only it had been the other way about .
littlegreen house ?
to be placed in general smutss own hands , you understand ?
well , i couldnt say .
you have heard the sad news ?
ive never seen him wide-awake .
what time did she return ?
attractive young man , that tennis pro .
an hour elapsed between his arrival and the moment when he presented himself at the house .
you do not need my co-operation , no ?
a step on the stairs , said poirot .
on that evening miss marple received a note from sergeant cornish .
edna saw something .
bantry reassured her gently .
even if it had been a cat , it would have been more sensible either to leave it there or to mention it to one of the maids , or to me , or to mother .
good morning , sir william .
hullo , stephen .
my position is that i represent the family .
did one of one of the parkinson boys .
vanity was the achilles heel .
adolf kochs clinic in berne , said craddock .
just so had that child stood back and watched him .
she never remembered what shed done with things .
do you think thats what aunt laura would have wished ?
i soon cut that short by telling him to unpack the big typewriter .
which is it likely to be ?
which suits ?
mark gaskell talked too much .
a man with a car could have done it easy enough .
did you see anyone elseon the village side of the river ?
van aldin did not answer for a minute or two , then he said : i dont exactly know what his intentions were .
miss blacklock turned from the mantelpiece .
perhaps you would not mind running over the factsif it does not distress you too much .
there is another point .
did she feel the slightest pang of remorse for any of her three crimes ?
i was , however , confident that i would be dismissed well before eleven oclock .
vii upstairs i sat by megans bed waiting for her to come round and occasionally cursing nash .
but i do think she is in danger .
blue teddy is going to have his dinner now , she would declare .
so altogether you think miss lawson was a more worthy recipient of miss arundells fortune ?
plans must be abandoned .
catching up a heavy staff sobek attacked it furiously .
we laughed , and boyd carrington said : you neednt talk , my lad , youve never been married .
asked miss lemon , surprised .
he has no possible motive .
chicken pox ?
then you think he never really cared for her ?
you know , dont you , that your father and helen actually lived here in dillmouth for a while ?
but it was too late .
he knew , certainly , that she loved him with a deep and passionate devotion .
hallo , george , said mrs .
so much depends on nursing in pneumonia , does it not .
the assistant commissioner said thoughtfully : so youre for balking him .
she wore bits of rhinestone and not much else .
i am very fond of you , mon amiindeed i am fond of you .
colonel race was the first to enter the room .
ladies like variety gentlemen always like the same thing .
miss macnaughton gave a swift glance at the lapis .
she was angry and picked it upandwrung its neck !
by nashs invitation i went with them .
we could manage _num_ .
a tall indian in a turban came out of the cottage and waited attentively .
_num_ the third-floor flat ' bother ?
you must know that .
graham , but im worried .
i was thinking of you as you were when you were a girlbefore you married nevile .
one hasnt the least idea .
for some few seconds she remained silent , staring at me .
oh no , in the photographic room .
the true motive that lay behind her strangling of the small brother whom she undoubtedly loved has always been a puzzle .
i have an introduction to him and he might be able to tell me something interesting .
little captain andrassy sprang up .
he looked at her , then he smiled .
so is the colouring .
and such odd things .
why , can you think of anyone else ?
she said : youre thinking me vindictive ?
the mans bewitched , said bundle .
you didnt see her , mother , said violet .
they bought it with the house .
hardcastle slipped the card across the table to her .
hubbard tearfully .
i understood veritys wish for secrecy because i knew what a strong personality clotilde bradbury-scott had .
then she took out mr .
cried battle as he started to run .
the first wife died out in india .
an opinionated boor describes him exactly .
then theres the queer business of the stewardess , she continued thoughtfully .
but why is it meritorious ?
my long experience of life and human nature .
and it makes me sick to hear you talk and talk , as though nobody mattered but you .
they actually saw her type that letter .
yours truly , andrew restarick he said sharply : when did you receive this ?
it is too much that .
he said : no question of heart failure or anything like that .
in reply to my question as to lord edgwares marrying again she ridicules the ideasimply because it has never occurred to her .
with her right hand thyrza took my left .
but you understand , no repeating of things that you overhear .
now , dont dwell on it .
it was not , of course , a serious offence , but it started him off wrong .
cant allow that , dear lady , cant allow that , cried mr .
mind you , death maynt have been intended .
i would be glad to know what is the present position regarding winnie ?
hargreavess .
yes , thats true , said lord mayfield .
he and james stoddart- west are out hunting for clues in a big way .
in that case , said miss marple , i shall wait until this afternoon .
the inspector broke off , clearly at a loss for words .
she is here if you want to see her ?
no , even she isnt out of it .
he said : their contents , by the way , are strictly confidential .
thats because , thought gerda , with one of her flashes of acumen , hes so pleased to be going to the angkatells .
two basket chairs and a bench .
shell do now .
she was an extremely wealthy woman .
hes just like me what chance have we got against all of them ?
what can you do with a woman like that ?
what about the other members of the gang ?
my prices are cheaper than the big stores , and so i tell them .
well , im sorry to hear that .
professor roche ought really to have been present at the last one .
i heard them talking about it .
thus mr .
pathetic , reasonable people who come up to you and explain how theyre being persecuted and how everyone is spying on themand you sometimes feel it must all be true .
for instance) to the house ?
he was very different in those days , m .
she was emphatic that he had not seemed troubled or worried in any way .
a tag 	gentleman he was , with a beard and a big hat .
she felt curiously inadequate and tongue-tied .
look here , christine .
i wonder whether , after all , you know as much as we think ?
all this is of no importance .
he said he had known it the first evening he danced with me .
morphia or some form of opium .
michel had run posthaste to answer it .
race looked at him .
i know that sounds fantastic , but there was a case like that in north devon not very long ago .
you mustnt blame yourself .
i didnt want to go near her or see her .
not that it matters someone who was on our side , as we used to say when we were kids .
inspector neele found it a little difficult to know what to say .
burn her , i mean , like a witchor of course , she added matter-of-factly , we could just put her in the dustbin .
balderdash , sir , he exclaimed angrily .
you didnt say a young man was beautiful .
you have been thorough , said poirot .
so we get a step further in our description of the murderera person who had the opportunity to take these shoes of ralph patons from the three boars that day .
poor frank has rather a weak headand the drink upset him and so he felt likelike making a row , and he came round to queen charlotte street to have it out with mr .
poirot murmured : jacqueline de bellefort .
all the same , my dear , nobody seems to know much about this fellow .
but pagett had reckoned without suzanne .
yours ever , amy leatheran enclosing the letter in an envelope , she addressed it to sister curshaw , st .
whats the matter with you , mikeyoure shivering .
perhaps i was .
i must have a taxiat once .
he nodded in approval .
i have been very busy , said mrs .
very attentive to her wishes and all that .
i suppose that slack could not very well say he had .
a few minutes later , frankie was able , if not to sit up , at least to take notice .
here is the explanation of how our man was able to pass through locked doors , said m .
everyone rose and adjourned to the lounge for coffee .
are you miss reece-holland ?
the sooner i can get one person eliminated and go onto the next , the better it is for everyone concerned .
i said something about his being afraid it would kill people or maim them for life or something .
but of course , with hall porters anderguides .
presently the telephone at the secretarys elbow purred , and he took up the receiver , spoke for a minute or two , then turned to his employer .
she turned her head as tim allerton came up and joined them .
he appeared to inset it in the wood , and suddenly the log split in two .
the latter scrutinized it , then put it down on the table beside him with a nod .
he had a solitary lunch , and after it , frowning to himself a little , he went round to the sumptuous flat that housed the lady known as mirelle .
nous verrons .
but i certainly didnt expect him to start off with a phrase in arabic .
and the note that carelli had passed to you ?
the secretary woman , ella zielinsky .
the beautiful foreign adventuress , the international gang , the mysterious no _num_ , whose identity nobody knowsive read it all a hundred times in books .
i suppose youd call me the child of sin .
you should see him in action , said mr .
we had dancing class every week at school .
i beg your pardon he turned sharply .
you cant come and stay at the anglers arms .
so there was nothing especially worrying him , was there , before his death ?
ill go and order them .
i mean by that , did you discuss the situation as between her and her husband at all ?
tomorrow i may be myself with yesterdays ten thousand years , quoted anthony .
this crime wasnt safe !
poirot watched her in silence .
that does seem to me highly possible .
you understand so , my sweet .
she said nothing else that you can remember specially ?
end of angela warrens narrative .
she visited no picture galleries and no museums .
all this because guy pagett came into my bedroom this morning with a telegram in his hand and a face as long as a mute at a funeral .
here are the chantrys , she said .
jackie , do you mean ?
protheroe and hers for you was a dead secret , but in reality it was known and commented upon .
really , i wished miss reilly could have heard him !
i was going to write a play as a play .
remember the old boy said they wanted a house in dillmouth to be near mrs .
greg made as to move after her and then stopped .
of course he might have been one of the passengers ; i never thought of that .
whenever there is a chance of agreement being reached or any sign of dispersal of suspicion , some incident occurs to plunge one side back in distrust , or the other side into definite hysterical fear .
then i tried lady susan .
yesand perhaps because of that he talked too much .
he could take you to the station .
polton indeed .
used to stroll up to the george and have one .
he said in a queer , inexpressive voice : no , boyd carrington wont get bullied by his wife .
supposing that the spirit of the dead king is not yet appeased ?
oh , she had dark hair .
what was her name now .
arlena is on the beach below wondering why patrick is so long in coming .
sometimes , secretly , i had felt slightly hurt .
thats my idea .
i wonder if theyre still living there well have to go and see .
im afraid , you know , that i look every minute of my age !
it would be well , i think , he confided to hastings , if we were to put this box of so very dangerous drugs back in its proper place .
poirot looked at superintendent spence thoughtfully .
extraordinarily selfish , these public men .
franklins a fool !
then there were all the showsthe fat woman ; madame arensky , who told the future ; the human spider , horrible to look at ; the shooting gallery , where madge and monty spent always a great deal of time and money .
married man .
go on , and dont mind me .
i didnt know what you were like .
you are wrong about there being nobody in the house , said mr .
what time do you expect henry home ?
if there is anything else i can do to help you , please , please let me know .
carlile , said carrington gruffly , is all right .
and mind you , i know what i am talking abouta lot of subalterns have passed through my hands in my time .
vandemeyer !
hes no good , ruth ; hes rotten through and through .
the side door was locked , so was the front door .
did you ever see such a sight ?
it is an idea only , dessin warned him , i have a picture here of the corps de balletthat is she , the fourth from the leftit says anything to you , yes ?
then she murmured a word and like lightning cerberus bent his long neck and the steak disappeared as though by magic .
you remember i thought once i had ryland successfully cornered ?
without a word i handed them back to norton .
not more , that is , than might be expected considering her home circumstances .
ii we are going into the country , georges , said hercule poirot to his valet .
we were hurried through the woods at a breakneck pace , going uphill the whole time .
greg ?
naturally he rushed to the window .
ali leaned back in his chair .
fane pronounced .
still , i really do think she has enjoyed herself !
poirot ?
it must have all been very carefully planned and thought out .
one was a little , sharp , dark , ferret-faced man , the other was tall and fair .
theres only one place for ee to stay .
one flat was more attractive than the otherhaving better shaped rooms and a better outlookbut the other had a small extra room and was also cheaper , so we settled on the cheaper one .
i think wed better go now , right away , and see what we can find out .
he looked at me through the top of his spectacles .
she must have done .
her name is crockett .
you dont know , she said , and the words appeared to be addressed either to me or to the bookshelf behind my head , how lovely it is to have a daughter !
i like things open , always , he called out to them .
that was really very oddvery remarkable !
she was to come down to see me off .
one of them was placing the coffee-pot on the table as i entered the room .
dont rub it in .
following the shock of the discovery , she gave birth to a dead child born prematurely , and herself died .
there must be people who know things , not of their own knowledge , but what people have told them .
it was , she supposed , henets way of amusing herself .
he said : i beg your pardon ?
after that , freedom .
or known by that name .
it would have been to no avail .
he was an insurance agent .
i am still , as far as he needs one , his secretary .
i just wanted the exact time .
this , though often an embarrassment , and a cause of bringing the conversation to a close , was perfectly in order now .
its a good timefrequently leads to free food for two .
treves , leaning back in his chair , was absentmindedly polishing his glasses .
i want you to do a rather unpleasant job for me , ruth ?
he went to perch on one arm of the armchair .
miss holland , rosethey could have heard what agnes said .
a frown of perplexity creased his forehead .
you havent murdered anyone , have you ?
the suit he wore that night had bloodstains on it , of course , most damning of all , his fingerprints were found on the actual weaponand no one elses .
dont romance .
i wondered .
also your mothers brother , the great and powerful meriptah , the nomarch of the province .
philip durrant .
not long out of school , id say .
he lunged forward at miss marple but this time it was cedric who caught him by the shoulder .
anyone would think you were ordering a dinner at the ritz .
that would explain , i said deliberately , why mrs .
poirot opened a capsule , examined its contents and tasted it gingerly with his tongue .
but have you told me everything known to you about this young man paton ?
it must be put down .
alasi do not know those two expressions .
it was concerning that third operation that tuppence pondered as she lay in bed the following morning .
' ' yes , there was something .
i could get hold of her , i expect .
oh , emmas all right , said bryan .
you should have heard the drivel george talked about my girlish mind and the pleasure it would be to form it .
oliver , sinking into a chair .
she had spied on people , she had snooped , and she had seen things .
it means something .
race doesnt like it , either , i can see .
entwhistle on the platform of bayham compton station .
he paused again in an effort of concentration .
thank you , mademoiselle .
only this morning miss marple pausedout of breath .
regretfully tuppence noted the fact that there was no cover .
hes gone through every penny he ever had , publishing rotten verses in fancy bindings .
she had been nearly forty when lynn was born and her health was not good .
poirot , nigel would never do a thing like that .
he soon began to know the adjacent rooms by heart , and he contracted a lasting hatred of mummies .
lord caterham , torn from his interested perusal of forthcoming sales of rare books , looked up absentmindedly .
poirot replied that the mastermans and the cowans , two families with young people in them , had gone off on an all-day sailing excursion .
look here , victoria , said richard .
you think that he is running away ?
the war and blitzes have brought that aboutbut i dont knowshe frowned reflectivelyperhaps spiritually the family has always lived togetherunder my grandfathers eye and protection .
most chaps do .
what have they looked for in elliss room ?
she used to sit listening to him spellbound .
she passed by the cornbins and the outhouses and through the gateway into the courtyard .
and to do that , unfortunately , one must have money .
muffins , i saw hed got there .
she said , i must be going .
' ' what is life without a latchley ?
maltravers was a christian scientistor something of that kind .
to begin with , listen to that !
i am steeped in miserywallowing in gloom .
was it that that dr lorrimer came to see him about ?
thats what i said to you and what i said to edie , but edie she wouldnt have it at any price .
im so glad to know you at last , my dear .
whats the big idea ?
for gods sake , dont hiss at me .
getting nabbed by the police is all the great and glorious work you and your precious lot would have been likely to accomplish .
husband didnt like it .
and i shall get away where nobody will ever find me .
hed know then what a sweet , dear girl she is .
' at the bottom of the garden he could make his way out to a main road .
my annoyance was quickly changed to concern .
the war settled down to a grisly stalemate .
i got him away from it and managed to make out the inscription , in spite of its being so rubbed .
whatwhat did he say ?
he did not hear what she said , but schwartz came back looking crestfallen .
rampant autumn michaelmas daisies still survived , tied up severely to sticks ; chrysanthemums had not yet relinquished life .
the manager had to send a messenger to the police station , and the hydro is right out of the town , up on the edge of the moor ; and mrs .
what will you do ?
lancaster , i believe , is quite an old lady and inclined to be forgetful .
he gave the address of his rooms in jermyn street .
heather badcock , flushed and triumphant , came a little ahead of her husband .
and i couldnt say exactly what it is .
theyd have to get me out of the way first .
did he deliberately mean to fasten the crime on jim ?
there are so many luke cut her short .
retired tradesman , thats what he is , thought fred narracott .
have they arrested him ?
and today , most fortunately , is a thursday .
he himself went off in search of his luggage , thinking as he did so : just a little bit batty ?
you permit that i return the king of clubs to the psck ?
gilles shook his head tactfully .
see it , perhaps , from a clearer angle .
a drop of something to drink , eh , mr .
what the devil did you mean ?
he reappeared within a minute or two , much to hollabys satisfaction , as two other players were coming up behind them , and the light was failing rapidly .
i wanted to know something about her father , her stepmother , the boy she is in love with , the people she lived with , and worked for in london .
thats what we do .
i gather she was thinking of paying him a visit .
no corners .
i do not like sour faces .
the house is really sold , then ?
the most furious quarrel he had had with her had arisen over that .
yes , said poirot , i think youve judged quite right .
you could , i feel sure , if you chose , exercise your considerable charm .
ardwyck fenn , lola brewsterand the photographer girlwhats her name ?
never does it remain tranquil no , not for a little minute .
come and chew a bun with me .
you see , it was rather like that terrible story about the lion in rhodesia which used to go on and on .
it had buzzed mildly ever since the exhumation proceedings .
they were neither pleasant nor gentlemanly men , but i was quite certain of one thing , that they were speaking the absolute truth when they said that sanders had been the whole time in their company .
he said no more , but at a gesture from him the assembled party took their seats .
do you know who that could be ?
her eyes went to tim , then shifted to dr .
all this side was numbers from _num_ to _num_ .
although it was past working hours , old briggs , the gardener , was putting in a little work on a flower bed and he straightened up as the inspector passed .
after a minute or two she closed the book and stayed thinking .
you cleared up that nasty abernethy business for me .
i was duly landed at the spot indicated .
it might be the lords will that your hair should grow out .
she thought she was doing the best for me .
he snorted with anger .
when the wretched devil said he was feeling bad yesterday afternoon , he was just speaking the truth .
moiras responsesuitable , rather shy .
disgraceful !
poor darling , shed never had any of the usual funbeing in love , and leading men on and teasing themand having a home and children and all the real fun of life .
hell be in front of the fire there with the times .
really most interesting .
it seems to me much the same as usual .
linspecteur , when you have finished here , you will mount to us and ask questions at your leisure .
often , looking across the table at his wife , he felt gladly what a perfect helpmate she wasjust what he had always imagined .
i was at contessa martinellis .
someone might notice as you noticed the next morning .
but why do you want to leave now ?
he was probaby seriously annoyed with his young woman for breaking out the way she did .
i have come , she said , to speak about the poor girl who was killed .
c , i said , repeating the initial thoughtfully .
old spence got rosaleen down to have a look at him .
you know who killed madame kettering ?
hastings !
she did not replymerely persisted : that idea never occured to you ?
wonderful fellow , the old man .
she saw somethingpauline saw something that nightonly she wasnt sureshe told me she wasnt sure .
des and i were to have shared the swag in paris and now the swine runs out on me !
oh no , said max , it often happens .
the inspector went across to the panel .
shes only twenty-six now .
anyway , she added , i ceased being his secretary some time ago .
you thought , said micky , that it might have been father and gwenda ?
after a long wakeful period whilst i vainly tried to think of something helpful i could do to avert the catastrophe , i fell into a heavy sleep about six a .
they say he was devoted to her , though .
i have been handing them out the goods .
ten i poirot stepped back , his head a little on one side as he surveyed the arrangement of the room .
she ought to be proud of me , happy for me , happy for the wonderful life that ive achieved .
he turned out of the lighted thoroughfare .
my little friend blinked up at him placidly .
i thought it was the phoneor perhaps being ill .
oliver , no doubt , had a vivid imagination , but but after all , murmured hercule poirot to himself , i am not a consultant in adultery or in incipient adultery .
but she was remembering walter fane polishing his eyeglasses and the queer blind stare of his eyes when she had first mentioned st .
you arrived this morning at what time ?
interesting , i should imagine , to a psychologist .
it isnt necessarily because they have any guilty knowledge .
ii had no idea that it was anything of this kind .
oh i could fix it by the funeralthe day after .
sir rowland was already lifting the receiver .
well , lets see enderby reflected .
it was not until just before sunset that she stood upright , smoothing back her hair and the pleats of her dress which had got crumpled and disarranged , and wondered vaguely why neither satipy nor kait had been out as usual .
she deposited his hat on the hall stand and led the way to a pleasant room overlooking a narrow walled garden .
what did you say ?
he hesitated and then passed outand in so doing missed the sensation of the daya greater sensation even than not half winning the st .
all right , said jimmy .

dont be silly , greta .
the colonel used the colloquial expression with a slight effort .
i thought perhaps mr .
you can dance !
oh , youre always thinking things like that , mother , said jennifer .
it was very seldom that molly kendal was out of temper .
he was talking to elsa greer .
yes , but look here , whos been murdered ?
poirot , within the last six months he has had three narrow escapes from death : once from drowningwhen we were all down at cornwall this summer ; once when he fell from the nursery window ; and once from ptomaine poisoning .
during dinner little was said .
it was as though he were looking forward to something pleasurableexciting possibly a big deal that he was going to pull off ?
even the carpenter who once fashioned a particularly hideous towel-rail of wood for one of our expedition houses had the creative spirit .
we made you a birthday cake , said emma .
inspector winkfield dismissed her and then said curtly : i would like to speak to mr .
ill sit down and have a word with m .
i sat down and she shoved a small pile of letters towards me .
he added , as miss brewis dealt with his request , i see that you are all in a great state of activity .
actually really do it ?
i dont , said bill indignantly .
we applied to london for help over it .
madame , you can and you do believe it !
bouc broke off .
shell ring up or turn up sooner or later , i suppose .
poirot , i said , i congratulate you .
he straightened up from operations on a flowerbed as gwenda approached .
i was sorry not to have seen you at dinner last night , she said .
you have succeeded admirably .
my chum .
ill have worked out a plan by then , and ill look up the places on my map .
did you not find it yourself ?
howd you feel if that got in the sole of your foot ?
and things arentarentas you might think they are .
no , not nice .
my friend looked at me dispassionately .
philip said warningly : remember , i cant vouch for the accuracy of my memory .
superintendent battle said thoughtfully : as you were sitting at the bridge table , no ones chair was directly facing the fireplace ?
she as wearing a white evening-dress .
it would not be equitable to do so .
certainly i knew her .
you dont think im anyone else , do you ?
in due course i got a telegram from punkie and rushed up there , to find rosalind looking very proud of herself in a nursing-home and inclined to be boastful of her babys strength and size .
well , i think that miss bartons father made all his money out of ruining amy durrants father , so amy determined to have her revenge .
however , an inquiry of miss brewis gave him rough guidance .
remand them for the psychiatrists report .
it was just something i was looking for in a vague , unsatisfied sort of way .
it makes the old bayreuth festival hall look like a comprehensive school !
in all fairness , no .
she made it in illustration .
ii excuse me , do you mind if i sit down here and talk to you for a moment ?
all finishes happily .
percy and i never got onthats all there is to it .
im not saying anything to anyone at present , he said .
an old clergyman , she said .
took dolly to an empty cottage we knew of and i stayed with her there for some days .
that of number four was quite unrecognizable , the head blown to pieces .
awarded me fourteen thousand shares as a small recompense for my services .
that evening , i did not drink my coffee .
the inspector and constable jones immediately accompanied the butler to the front door , where the inspector had the unenviable task of confessing to the divisional surgeon that , as it turned out , there was at present no body to examine .
strange , said battle .
shedidnt like to refuse .
ii oo , it did give me a turn , said mrs groves , as she went round the showroom , dusting .
oh , i quite understand that the police wont let it drop .
well , you see , m .
what is the first thing she will think ?
rowley said uncertainly : yes , of coursebut arent youwell , i mean , busy ?
ford v _num_ .
and what i say is , if that brute was blackmailing you , you did quite right to crack him over the head and good riddance .
once or twice shed been quite frightened and old mr .
its all settledill send her packing .
said bess sedgwick sharply .
how do you do , mr .
although dated last february , it only reached me by post this morning .
' i knew there was something .
it was fatechancehe shrugged his shouldersthe masters of all of us .
it is a picture , isnt itmust be , that shape .
she was devoted to her children and seldom thought or spoke about anything else .
shes longing to get a chance to cross-question you .
he had once said laughingly that there were enough in it to kill a man !
cant understand it myself .
wimbornes sharp glance with perfect impassivity .
because once your scientist is in the free world again , he could refuse to work for his new employer .
she listened to him patiently and attentively .
her maid , milly , was an efficient dragon who guarded her mistress from the onslaughts of the outside world .
im sorry , veronica .
miss bellever went out shortly afterwardsto get something , but i cant remember what .
satterthwaite and egg lytton gorepoirots audiencesitting in the outer darkness .
tuppence wasnt quite sure whether it was nice .
i expect in real life criminals are more careful , i said .
but surely i read that you had retiredthat youd taken a holiday for good and all .
well , hes given himself away pretty hopelessly .
i should say wed dug about two solid square acres !
those were the days when i used to be banished from the kitchen with decision .
this is the moment when we can have a real family of our own .
he did not understand this piece of masters conversation .
what had she thought and felt about a stepdaughter who was apparently deliberately trying to poison her ?
you are a detective yourself , arent youa real one ?
no , said tuppence , not at all .
let him do it running and walking .
masterton , the members wife .
and barbara ; i had completed the final demise of lord edgware , and had tracked down his murderer successfully .
hes practically gaga , isnt he ?
i mean id never go and listen at a door .
probably he thought i knew more than i did .
do you think she has run away because she has a guilty conscience ?
that at least i have learned in the course of my life .
bunch explained with her usual economy of words .
a bewildering ten days ensued .
i think myself the eserine was her idea , but that she made her besotted slave do the switch .
on an impulse sarah joined him .
said pilar .
midge , he thought , is the rock on which i can build my life .
it fits , he murmured .
for my part , i was tired and dozed in a corner .
dont drink it , i say .
is she one of the yorkshire twiddledos ?
and all a snare for the feet of hercule poirot .
its very interesting to hear about these things from the inside , said my sister complacently .
we alighted at the door of a small house standing back from the road .
unless they wanted to see mrs .
were you here yourself at the time mrs .
and now what are we to do with you , mr .
his manner was all smiling urbanity .
mosgorovsky , he ordered the place to be swept out this morning , and i did it while he waited .
excited , i started work .
glad ive got another fellow to keep me in countenance .
at least a dozen impecunious young men were to be found dangling round her on all occasions , in the hunting field , in the ballroom , wherever she went .
oh , ii dont know .
seeing as how i only saw his back , its hard to say .
he flattened himself against the hedge .
sit down , and dont interrupt , she said .
you see , bunch , you are not the kind that minds much about what people think of you .
every minute this case gets more puzzling , cried fournier .
theyre awfully decent about getting us jobs and all that , but you see , the trouble is , that were not particularly brainy .
he had some little difficulty in finding greane , and still more difficulty in finding salters lane , but after knocking up two cottages , he succeeded .
you might not .
for the matter of that , somebody always does know .
it may have been the herzoslovakian , boris , who exceeded his orders and fired that shot .
gardener , why , i said , sightseeing is all very well , and i do like to do a place thoroughly .
beyond the fact that that was certainly not the number of his car , it conveyed nothing to him .
what was that picture rising before his eyes ?
youre henry angell ?
thank you , miss nevill .
went on briggs suspiciously , when you went along to the potting shed for them bamboos ?
up to now i hope youve enjoyed yourself , said clotilde .
he put it into miss pebmarshs hands .
she was going to her mother in wales with the children last monday .
did they find anything ?
most lads of twenty fought in the war .
if you dont want to put on a gas mask and a shirt of chain mail , shall we start ?
her backhand , however , had definitely improved .
one doesnt luckily have to bother about that .
do you want to know what i think ?
and then , suddenly , i got a revelation .
she gave a sudden shiver and shook her shoulders impatiently .
parker pyne found basil chester a most likeable young man .
how dare you interfere ?
there is just some irrelevant matter to be cleared out of the way .
i was left with the impression that i had disappointed her .
but it was incumbent upon meyou must perceive thatto make some sort of suggestion !
he is convinced he has been mistaken in thinking he heard one .
no , he said , im quite sure of that .
why would that matter , mademoiselle ?
you shall not lose your lives because of me .
they went into the smoking room .
again jim fanthorp reflected .
there you have me beat , said mr .
he got up and left the table .
its only potatoes on top .
he paused questioningly with a genial expression .
just the one .
what was the good of pointing out to people that the germans were building the finest air force in europe and not just to fly round and have picnics !
in my fever i opened my eyes and saw that facewith its sweet , unearthly smileit was a good dream .
most of captain harveys friends and acquaintances consider him an amiable but brainless young mandevoted only to the trot of the fox or whatever the dance is called .
and how do you think i can aid you ?
with a slight grimace he recorked them .
my friend , replied poirot , i do not know what you are talking about .
buried somewhere in the grounds ?
what name shall i say ?
there was also , said tommy , an enemy agent living down here .
i came up to warn you not to be taken in by mother , but i think now that there is no need to do that .
you have proved yourself a brave and resourceful man .
who inspired them ?
he would welcome them as showing how much importance you attached to the document .
he understood her , i think , and he was worried sometimes about us .
her smile hardened .
i was not doing him any harm by sticking to my lie .
did lady tressilian like mr .
but the interior of this cat is perfectly delicate .
hes so clever .
miss marple smiled apologetically .
our domestic help didnt take to it much , but we soon arranged that hired cars should take them into the nearest seaside town or into market chadwell on their days out .
presently the needle reached sixty .
only by environment , not by relationship .
on the one hand she did not consider an upstart dr .
a man who might have done a good deal and gone far had it not been for his unreliable judgment in all matters of business .
she was devoted to her young master and mistress and detested the spraggs .
his eyes passed indifferently over the people sitting round him .
i remembered how simply marvellous you looked that night at crows nest , and i thought , now that ive got money to spend , i shall go to mrs .
its harder to remember and live up to .
at least a minute elapsed before she looked up with a sigh .
now , magda edith hurried after her .
the way he had employed his time was his own business and none of ours , and he declined definitely to state where he had been and what he had been doing .
jackson also was very much to the fore , pretending to be looking after miss marples baggage .
but the death of alice corrigantell me , inspector colgate , do you not notice one striking form of similarity in this crime ?
were on the right track , i think ?
commander haydock was a big hearty man with a weather-beaten face , intensely blue eyes , and a habit of shouting most of his remarks .
nineteen owners of that tiny bit of land ?
it seems unlikely that shed make a visit here at this juncture on purpose to poison marina because of that .
she could see no light .
of course , it might be his father .
you couldn ' t see the fish at all !
' _num_ then he stood uptight and looked slowly round t _num_ , he did not move , he handled nothing , but neverth ?
was it of derek capel he was speakingor was it of himself ?
the elderly doctor came into the room rubbing his hands , for it was a chilly morning .
an overfed faun , inspector curry thought suddenly , and somehow there was an unpleasantness about that idea .
it certainly expressed dissatisfaction .
whalley was killed by order of the big fourbut not by grant .
we assumed she was still there .
or even , perhaps , miss king ?
iv delighted gasps and feminine squeaks of appreciation were heard in the darkness .
what are you giving us for dinner tonight ?
and whats your own opinion ?
the wire nettings coming down by the far tennis court , briggs .
argyle seemed to consider .
it was then that the guests had arrived .
morley and his sister had occupied the two top floors of the house as a maisonette .
theyd do best to leave it alone .
if anyone likes to say i behaved like a cad , theyre welcome to say so !
miss marple turned to jason rudd .
sweetiman , looking out of the post office window , exclaimed to herself disapprovingly .
very good work of yours , to ferret me out like this .
such appears to be the effect of weddings on mothers .
anne opened a door and led me into a large dim attic which was evidently used as a lumber room .
but to bring that precious pair to justice , that is another matter .
something in poirots twinkling eyes made katherine lower hers .
i dont like him very much .
i said impulsively : i should think a girl must get fed up with that sort of life .
its incredible that the police have never been able to lay hands on him .
we are in the month of june .
until then a deep peace brooded over the residential area of the stag .
i think five pound notes used to be made of wonderfully good paper once , you know .
when frank died there was very little leftonly a tiny income for me .
im not doubting your final story , mrs hailsham-brown , the inspector assured her .
you are not young , but you are , if i may say so , tough .
i am proud and excited to feel that all this has happened in my lifetime , and i would like to be able to look into the future to see the next steps : one feels they will follow quickly on one another now , with a snowballing effect .
but we heard the shots , said mildred .
as i reached the head of the stairs , i heard the door of the room open , and at the same time the kafir stirred and moved .
you put it very justly , madame .
bantry grinned .
unwillingly she opened a drawer and took out an untidy file of papers .
theres just a chance one of them might be able to identify her .
i felt a slight sense of superiority .
ah , you admit it ?
you want me to speak quite franklyto say things that in the ordinary course of events i should not sayand that , excuse me , sir , you wouldnt dream of listening to .
what interests me is the telegram , said poirot .
every night they had a fresh adventure .
you know , your china and glass and furniture .
not since the affair of the yellow jasmine have we met , and that is nearly a month ago .
how about it , badger ?
she knew nothingshe had heard nothingshe had been asleep .
poirot looked at me appealingly .
i shouldnt imagine they ever did any experiments in laboratories with it .
jane must be marrying a rich man , he murmured cynically .
i wont see a doctor !
a scientific fact , i assure you .
roger demanded .
the inspector put a hand to the back of his head , and looked at the floor as though seeking inspiration there .
abbots red face turned slightly purple .
to do so is to commit the solecism .
roderick was a great relief to her .
there was no disguising that heartfelt note of thankfulness .
i dont like the idea of blackmailing a woman .
wasnt looking that way .
the pen slips from my fingers , i drop forward , but not very far forward , for the chair is low , and the desk is high , and , moreover , my arms support me .
takes up half the bedroom as it is .
what is it now , eh ?
entwhistle must be gaga !
thompson walked slowly down the steps and out into the road where he joined the highbrow mother and daughter , who seemed to be feeling the wind cold on their exposed arms .
i should now like to see the valet of m .
he paused and then said : this , m .

so curious and unexpected that she stood there motionless , watching .
everyone descended to the house where suitable refreshments were waiting .
macwhirter tells a very odd story .
her tone carried conviction .
a producer of plays would have cast him without hesitation for the role of the great philanthropist .
so the kid told you ?
i usually do my shopping quite early in the day and then get back so that i can do the darlings lunch , and then comb and groom them .
there is indeed .
jeremy gasped .
first came : amberiotis .
gardener knows that .
ones that arent what you think they are , sometimes things as you wouldnt have believed in about them .
nevile and his wives .
yes , i am upset , said mitzi dramatically .
damn it all , cried dering , youll involve me in all sorts of publicity .
its a doll .
we parted on the understanding that suzanne should employ her talents to her best advantage .
abernethie may have been poisoned ?
i thought perhaps you might care for an advance .
unceremoniously i yanked her to her feet .
they were both liars of the most unblushing order .
i admit that that seems rather far-fetched , but it seems the only really feasible theory .
for a woman has at heart a great desire to speak the truth .
the four bridge players went slowly through the doorway .
i spoke with that kind of spurious geniality which seems to be expected of general practitioners .
but miss marple thought she knew something else about mr .
youd be surprised at some of the things ive run into .
i did not go in to poirot .
youre looking rather upset , arent you ?
sitting in the big armchair in his library , a pillow behind his head and his feet up on a pouffe , with a rug over his knees to emphasize his invalid status .
all inspector neeles success in his profession had come from listening well .
oh , yes , that part of it was all right .
this car was making , perhaps for the village she had left last night .
we shall find him in the sitting room .
youre not to think about it .
i might be going towell , bother you rather .
her hands clenched themselves , she kept very still .
ive just been standing by the lettuces talking , or being talked towhichever way you put it whos been talking to you ?
for the moment id forgotten that my father was dead inspector neele shook his head sympathetically .
no , said frankie slowly .
slowly , almost reluctantly , hercule poirot bowed his head .
hurstall stood aside to let them pass in .
deborahs friends !
yesall the rooms are locked .
i need not mince matters .
her eyes , he thought , were watchful .
he didnt get much change out of me .
no , chocolate and croissants for breakfast , djeuner at twelve-thirty if possible but certainly not later than one oclock , and finally the climax : le dner !
baker , you have had a quarrel .
hercule poirot looked at the ceiling and joined his fingertips .
perhaps we could see alice now .
she agreed doubtfully , but said we would discuss it again when we got to the falls .
then he sniffed the air delicately .
hes het up , but id say tom bettertons as sane as you or i .
the bolt slid back easilytoo easily .
thats funny , said mr .
it doesnt matter what it is .
but shes clever , of course , and shes got a rare head for business .
a new client .
they are entirely fictional .
had john lane but known it , in demanding the alteration to the denouement of the novel he unwittingly paved the way for a half century of drawing room elucidations stage-managed by poirot .
he didnt want to insure his life , but of course he made a will in my favour .
so did miss belleverand whats she ?
i know , my girl !
no _num_ was in his place .
she was used to being asked to give advice on what mrs .
she tended to cut up rough , i hear , but suddenly went off to egypt quite happily for the winter .
shed been there two months .
and she couldnt help him , couldnt do anything .
he mumbled , i remember .
i thought id better pin it all to the old boy .
jane felt more and more of a dummy .
such , as i say , was my interpretation of his attitude .
fundamental than that .
an hour .
he said : seen anything of rogers ?
sit down and ill bring the tea in , said mrs .
you never knew .
he was anxious to try the effect of a surprise attack .
symmington isnt fit .
the diocesan board and the local church were both very happy with the arrangement and in a letter of _num_ december _num_ hughes massie confirmed mrs mallowans intentions to assign the magazine rights of a long short story to be entitled the greenshore folly to such a fund .
and youll sleepoh yes , my little spy , youll sleep all right !
she raised her eyebrows slightly .
conscious of an inadequate nights sleep , and of a delicate mission successfully accomplished , m .
i never saw very much of her .
where did you find this ?
he spoke in an official tone .
sandra , you knowyou must know that i love you .
if you speak of this to hotel proprietor or police or any such person your son will be killed .
she held out the sketch book to mr .
now , messieurs , recount to me everythingfrom the beginning .
your cue may not come till the end of the playit may be totally unimportant , a mere walking-on part , but upon it may hang the issues of the play if you do not give the cue to another player .
again de sousa raised his eyebrows .
i figured it out that the news i was married to john would come almost as a relief !
they are at sunny point .
there should be one of a pair of china candlesticks there , said miss pebmarsh .
only to you have i told the story .
anyway , im not in the mood .
he could not be sure .
not with a rotten little peashooter like that .
it was clear that there were two fields of search open to me .
is she sharp ?
he stopped a minute , then went on : yes , that is itviolence .
some people have managed to stay on .
i wanted to know if it was a possibility .
any solutions offered ?
the downstairs rooms were closed and shuttered , and the small room into which we were shown smelt damp and airless .
all very well to stuff a comforter into a babys mouth to stop it crying .
as a matter of personal opinion yes , yes , that is understood .
oh thank you , sir .
but there aint one , wailed alfred .
from kings cross .
she always has been .
ive got one or two ideas .
its very confusing , i agreed .
said inspector crome , his thoughts not upon poirot but upon the two newcomers .
i took my courage in my hands .
the traitors in ones midst , always highly trusted , always splendid fellows , always the last people to be suspectedand all the timewell , a lot of all that never came to light .
granted that someone had removed captain trevelyans boots and hidden them up the chimney .
good manners and all that .
well now , of course i dont think so really , said celia , but this might be , mightnt it ?
jimmy stared at him .
true to mrs .
we cant help that .
you see , its very difficult when you look back over a period of months to remember just when this , that or the other happened .
i may later .
im afraid that observing human nature for as long as i have done , one gets not to expect very much from it .
lily had wanted to go to the pictures , aunt had said no .
been her own worst enemy , she volunteered .
sir henry asked : have you any reason to believe that the weapon from which the fatal shot was fired comes from my collection ?
inspector grange was not very satisfied with his investigations .
well put em through the machine to make sure .
i used to sing that when i was a small child .
and you asked them that at the post office ?
argyle , from all accounts , would have cared about very much .
thank god im only the social secretary .
enjoy yourself in ceylon , and give my love to dear roderickif he remembers me at all , which i doubt .
do anything , that i will .
ii so you see , tuppence , it would all fit in .
something worth looking at , eh ?
did you see her from the cliff as she paddled her float round to pixy cove ?
you frighten me , i said .
edward ferrier was saying : perhaps , m .
then i got a reply , just a whisper , it seemed , foscatinesomething like thatregents court .
ipy stood smiling and arrogant , his head held a little on one side , a flower held between his white teeth .
not romantic , you know .
it was to rowley she was going now !
i am hazy now as to how long i remained at miss drydensa year , perhaps eighteen months , i do not think as long as two years .
i dont know sometimes i feel that .
ill have to see the girl .
hoping to have your advice in the matter at an early date .
not just for babies and pretending .
i get you , said challenger , slowly .
he had a strong premonition of his own death .
no , plain mr .
please dont , begged mr .
at intervals the diesel engine gave its weird banshee warning cry .
aloud he said : and mr .
of course the most obvious person is veronica cray .
because i didnt wait no longer .
poirot rose to his feet bowing .
he wheeled round and looked at the house .
a lot depends on the impression they make on the jury .
he said : ive no pity for you .
thats the line she takes , said slack , coming back to his chair .
of course they are not people one has ever heard of .
we have done so .
mcgillicuddy handed the porter his tip which he received with disappointment , clearly considering it more applicable to third-class than to first-class travel .
folliat nodded a goodbye , and trotted off down the drive .
cried julius , bringing his fist down on the table with a bang .
i have the cabin right next to dr .
i cant carry on with it .
act as you think she would act .
it was something quite small .
she got up and said dryly , as she went towards the door : yes , ive known that for some time .
the room was empty except for lydia , who was standing half concealed by the window curtain at the far end of the room .
that is quite enough .
her hair was black , so were her eyes , and her eyelashes and eyebrows were more superbly black than any nature had ever fashioned .
even there , one sometimes felt , it was not as it had been in the last war , where you were patching up wounded men straight from the trenches .
if not , consult mr .
so it was you !
i am upset , laura responded with feeling .
the other was sir rupert crofton lee , a great traveller , and a man who had himself travelled through these remote regions and who knew something about their possibilities .
' d , ' john ' colonel clapperton was still deep in conversation with miss henderson .
you have been with lord listerdale a long time , havent you , quentin ?
tanios says at once , about my husband ?
she may have exaggerated it all a bitor even got it wrong .
he didnt feel up to things yet , but he had wanted to come down to the office .
youve got the weapon there , i see .
easiest way , and the cleanest way , was to go right out .
canon pennyfather left bertrams hotel not long after _num_ a .
see him ?
sandford stared wildly at him .
that is too bad , said ipy .
oh , no , not that long .
she looked at it in a dissatisfied fashion .
not a strong personality , you would say ?
that will be miss ramsbottom , wont it ?
and sohow could one put it ?
my wife and miss lindstrom and hester and possibly one of our daily helps would all be downstairs .
if he could reach it first instinct or his eyes warned her .
then i made sir oswald throw the pistol through the window .
was miss arundells illness a long and painful one ?
it was put there .
then his brow cleared .
there was nothing to indicate that any of the names of the open page were of special significance , but frankie copied the lot down in a little notebook as a poor substitute for all she had hoped to find .
satterthwaite was accustomed to the best cooking of continental chefs , and had in his own service a cordon bleu to whom he paid a fabulous salary .
we must get a doctor , we felt , at once , but before we could do that she clung to her husband .
our country , alas , is politically in a very bad state .
winburn gave a slight start .
here , i was forced to confess , i could not understand poirots attitude .
shed taken a headache powder and was lying down .
nicholson himself was absolutely unreal .
she is hardly the type to whom one would go for the truth , poirot agreed .
took me by the neck when i wasnt expecting it , and wrung it like a chicken .
he has shot more wild animals in unlikely places than any man living , i suppose .
then at ten-twenty mrs .
it opens up possibilitiesyour own child , mademoiselle elise ?
thats all bunkum , said raglan instantly .
miss marple , sitting close by , shook her head sympathetically .
johnstone estimates shes been dead between a fortnight and three weeks .
she whispered : it was for rosemary .
with carl von deinims papers i travelled to england and went to the address to which he had been recommended to go .
i think they might be usefulyes .
always hard to explain , but it happens .
sir george looked astonished .
well , said joyce , it seems to me we are a pretty representative gathering .
the old man was the last of them .
but all the same , reilly , i think you are wrong .
i could swear that the roll of films smelt of it also .
michael rogers , seeing the world , and getting off with good-looking girls when he feels like it !
no one can sing vissi darte as i can , said nazorkoff confidently .
what acumen !
queer .
that evening ?
allerton had breakfasted early , i found , and gone off to ipswich .
accompany me there in a boat , mr .
hercule poirot sighed and shook his head .
that someone counted on a superstitious dread ascribing the deed to the spirit of nofreta singularly convenient assumption .
then his eyes went to the two cupboards .
hilary concentrated on keeping her feet where he could not possibly tread on them .
he was not satisfied about this inmate .
ii this man tried to shoot uncle alistair and howard grabbed him and took the pistol away from him .
what exciting lives you and johnnie lead , said robin .
what is your price ?
but i never saw the shadows ; all i saw were some violets in a glass of water .
youve had a nasty shock .
all the same , he was puzzled .
the paper he had handed me was that compiled by the inspector and given by him to poirot that morning .
agatha christie marple miss marple _num_ : _num_ from paddington .
but you have some drugs ?
he said : you werent quite accurate just now .
sadly , mrs .
i lackshall we sayinspiration ?
id known his brother alan too , but not so well .
why should one ask it of womenthat they should be intelligent ?
he was so devoted to your motherhes got some feeling about this place .
there were curtains of a modernistic pattern in silver and green .
hilda hesitated a moment .
cia .
on this particular july morning , as i stood by the rail and watched the white cliffs of dover drawing nearer , i marvelled at the passengers who could sit calmly in their chairs and never even raise their eyes for the first sight of their native land .
parker pyne , must be made to sit up .
but i like to please griselda .
alfred sprang to his feet .
clarice vane bit her lip and flushed .
yes , sounds rather strange nowadays , nevertheless thats what it amounts to .
cest ridicule !
i got a doctors certificate that i wasnt fit to carry on , and i pleaded illness .
' erie murmured : ' so you thought - it might end - this way ?
shed come in from the drawing room .
she said sharply : that just shows you dont understand at all .
he retailed at length the conclusions that he and the doctor had arrived at together from the nature of the dead mans wounds .
you dont think it is over ?
weve got to the moment when weve got to understand just how everything happened .
it closes at half past five .
thats whats worrying you , is it , sir ?
this was a corker then a drink or two in the bar and a bit of a sleep in my room , and out about ten oclock with the girl-friend and a round of various hot spotscant even remember most of their names jumping frog was one , i think .
i picked up the revolverit was lying there at my feet in a corridor ?
but what difference would it have made ?
thomas as a youthful and ingenuous young man .
and you cant think of any other reason for her having done what she did ?
ipy was less impudent and offhand with his elder brothers .
but she was eloquent on the theme of the murder : it had all started with the visit here of a son of mr .
that i am making the return journey with you to shellal .
they adopted this plan .
did he marry a local girl ?
tuppence merely threw him a scornful look .
they are , every day .
oliver , the jobs you do give me to do .
i think theyve decided not to go on today because they really have to wait and see what the medical report is , so we are proposing to spend one more night here at the golden boar and to rearrange the tour a little , so that perhaps we shall miss out altogether going to grangmering which we were going to do tomorrow , and which is not very interesting really , or so they say .
the four of them went upstairs together .
it is no answer to say that the man was mentally unhinged .
there would be no point in timing that for a special hour on a special day in a special place .
let me introduce you , said mr .
she based her belief , i think , on the fact that the girl was wearing a good pair of nylon stockings and her best shoes .
lady coote agreed that it was with a depth of feeling in her voice that would have been invaluable to her as an emotional actress .
felicie bault ?
supposing the spanish womans story were true ; supposing that mary barton wilfully and in coldblood tried to drown amy durrant .
i joined edith de haviland on the terrace .
raymond , and mrs .
it had been said to her in succession by a nursemaid , a nanny , a governess , her grandmother , two great-aunts , her mother and a few others .
the car came , and it was large and fast , but all the same it was very late when we came into lymstock .
he went on slowly : i was particularly struck by the extraordinary difficulty of proving a case against any one person on the train and on the rather curious coincidence that in each case the testimony giving an alibi came from what i might describe as an unlikely person .
i suppose id better see what he wants .
i think the first production was at the everyman in hampstead , and the part of lucia was played by joyce bland , whom i always thought a very good actress .
you and i , the squares , the old-fashioned .
i told him that it was no good , that i didnt love him , that i hated him she paused , breathing hard .
it is not a spitfire , its a messerschmitt .
demanded mr .
thats a list of qualities .
she lit a cigarette .
the other thing i have to say is , that if there was a police officer in sittaford i should have been informed of it .
im not going to bag things because uncle had a bee in his bonnet .
dressed in deep mourning , the dull black showed up her fair colouring .
it concerns something you sawover a year ago now , nearer two years .
mary pulled at his hand .
we must think of something more useful than that .
nurse obrien responded : it was , indeed .
but my instinct told me that there were stirring times ahead .
why , my very own nephews wife .
the murdered man was not an occupant of the house , said the inspector .
thats usually the case .
is anything the matter ?
amyas turned round slowly and went into the house .
pat led them through a dark recess , apparently full to overflowing of perambulators , and through another door into the well of the flats , and guided them to the right lift .
twice embezzlement on his part was made good by the argyles .
well , she had done that , but rowley himself had sensed his uncles benevolent interest .
he cogitated .
the blood brothers of st .
crewe train is a study of a passionate individualist , back to methuselah is in sympathy with the intellectual rather than the emotional attitude to life .
she means something to you , david .
im afraid there isnt much there .
it was a piercingly cold night , raw and foggythe last night one would wish to spend in the open hanging about and waiting for something , very nebulous in nature , to happen .
i do indeed sympathize .
she boomed out : what ridiculous nonsense !
george had received anonymous letters stating that his wife had not committed suicide but had been killed .
well , i think theyre well off .
pauncefoot jones peered at him .
one of those children subsequently died as the result of criminal neglect and ill-treatment .
he went out shutting the door carefully behind him .
was the waiter helping you ?
it was to miss pebmarshs house that sheila went this afternoon .
she got herself mixed up with something , i said .
my brother was at harrow and my sister at brighton at the miss lawrences school which was afterwards to become roedean .
i can imagine that , said luke drily .
but i believe she comes from the west indies .
i knew that mothers brother with whom shed had a frightful row had died a very rich man .
excellent , i should say .
and it was miss politt who telephoned to spenlow ?
she demanded , with the eyes of an angry tigress .
it had to be admitted that her appearance was good .
and , if you ask me , that woman works with a gang .
but we can hear .
whos she and what does she do ?
he looked at craddock .
they ought to .
resultthe same .
doctors orders , mr .
you begin to see ?
too much fits in yesyesryeblackbirdsthe mans christian name neele said : im concentrating on the other lines toodubois is a possibilityso is wrightthe girl gladys could have caught sight of either of them outside the side doorshe could have left the tea tray in the hall and gone out to see who it was and what they were doingwhoever it was could have strangled her then and there and then carried her body round to the clothesline and put the peg on her nose a crazy thing to do in all conscience !
poirot noted anew how haggard the man looked .
probably why he took up with helen kennedy in the first place .
give me class every time .
andermatt , however , affected him unpleasantly .
by bolting he draws attention to himself .
that was the last time i saw her radiant and assuredon top of the world .
i began to see light .
you were startled .
she was drunk or doped and with an awful argentine gigoloramon .
but i was away all those years .
he remained thoughtful for a moment .
bauerstein explained how he had happened to be passing the lodge gates as the car came out , and had run up to the house as fast as he could , whilst the car went on to fetch dr .
later , on that same day , i went with chief inspector japp to interview the lady .
oh , i didnt say it .
i dont suppose it will be made public .
at last she nodded as though she had made up her mind .
but surely yes , yes , it will be most interesting .
joe should hold his tongue , said burnaby .
be quiet , damn you .
she knelt down by the prone figure and turned him very gingerly over .
the first time it was a waiter , who took their orders for cocktails , the second time it was a fashionable vacant-faced young man .
poirot is on the track .
anthony had insured his life in his wifes favour a few weeks before his death .
so there you are .
roberts flushed .
i said i supposed it might have been , but it seemed unlikely to me .
they were quite sure from what theyd heard about this place that that was so .
miss pebmarsh had asked for me specially .
at any rate , ive done my best .
i dont feel , somehow , she can be a really nice girl .
at the time of the arrest we thought jack argyle was lying .
he held out the dirty piece of paper .
an old-fashioned christmas .
me , i have a passion for the omelettes .
at tunbridge wells ?
are they often used , may i ask ?
she preceded him up the narrow staircase .
yes , yes , i willi mean , i do .
no need to bring them near decay and suffering before their time .
shes not normal , you know .
you got rid of me , sent me to gaol on a trumped-up charge , and then , amongst you all , you put her out of the way !
the real julius hersheimmer was a splendid fellow !
publish and be damned ?
matter of fact this business reminds me of a case in simla .
colonel johnson said : your husband has given us his account of the evening .
i turned gladly to welcome the interruption .
these things always did get round .
poirot said dryly : i must sympathize with you , madameespecially as i imagine that you have not often had to put up with things .
how can you state positively that the pearl found actually came from mrs .
of course , said professor wanstead , we knew beforehand what they were going to say .
as she bent her head towards him to light her cigarette he noticed how long and dark the lashes were that lay on her cheek and he thought to himself : old gordon knew what he was doing .
the house was very quiet .
she came out arguing with miss williams that she wasnt going to change her skirt for anyone .
butbut it never felt like that .
this arrogance hilary found very irritating .
come back from that malay conference , havent you ?
mouche letter from miss vansittart to a friend : dear gloria , the summer term has started smoothly .
discipline !
it took some little time to put the call through ; but poirots luck was in .
yes , the evidence , said poirot .
but what in creation do you want to know about my dressing gowns for ?
the drawer where the money was pulled out .
in that case it was probably theresa who had actually placed the thread in position .
i forget now exactly what led to it , but he suddenly used the phrase if anything happens to me .
its a black mystery , that .
ryder following the lovely marguerite with reverential eyes .
we know that , said lord altamount .
into this he could put all his ability , all his ambition .
the evidence of the italian _num_ .
we stayed in a private house with a middle-aged admiral , a charming man who had a most lovely alsatian dog .
inquest tomorrow , as i said .
tell him that his friend m .
he had never been of a philosophic cast of mind .
we had meant to buy a tiny cottage , instead we had bought this queen anne house with gracious windows and good proportions .
so he decides to cut his losses .
then you can get on with it .
she flushed and said violently : no .
i think we might order ourselves a liqueur on the strength of it .
i am in communication withermy bookmaker , replied poirot .
the account in the papers had evidently been carefully censored .
must have wasted an hour over that at least .
thank you , you are a good chap .
my idea was to do nothing until after the departure of the eleven-oclock train to rhodesia with most of the party on board .
i thought i had better not leave the house .
he found what he wanted easily enough .
he was , i understand , a friend of yours .
jacqueline de bellefort was sitting in a chair .
well , said the major gruffly .
the truth is , i suppose , that if you havent got a good eye for balls you havent .
in any case his rendezvous with tuppence had borne all the signs of a casual meeting , pleasurable to the lady and slightly alarming to himself .
were capable of doing big things .
she picked it up with a puzzled frown .
she asked , her fingers playing nervously with a brooch on her breast .
hercule poirot paused a minute with his hand on the window catch .
double shifts and bonusesall the rest of it .
i suppose it would be about a month .
nowit is different .
rather a queer thing for you to go out dancingat your time of life .
there was nothing more to be gleaned at the glengowrie court hotel except the negative fact that miss sainsbury seale had not seemed excited or worried in any way when she went out , and it would appear that she had definitely intended to return since on passing her friend mrs .
i like danger .
remember that .
how absurd to call youth the time of happinessyouth , the time of greatest vulnerability !
and edward was waitingand if for one moment edward doubted her loyalty , then she , victoria , would dieand die without the possibility of warning anyone .
oh yes , one does not forget , you know , things that happen when you were young .
shes got a good head on her , you know , underneath the fluffy manner .
then he looked at her curiously .
katherine corrigan .
when i told her that i was a doctor she gave a sigh of relief , and i ordered her off at once to one of the cottages for a rub down and dry clothing .
inspector japp of scotland yard will vouch for its accuracy , since it was through his kind offices that it came to my ears .
it would be a grand thing now in a government department , observed mr .
to return to our expedition , after sir eustace had backed out , miss pettigrew said she would remain at home in case he might want her .
it was still quite full although it was past the height of the season .
there is a pattern , said hercule poirot almost dreamily .
he just couldnt put a project over .
but he wasn ' t married !
ive known her for years in new zealand .
she said very quietly : we love each other .
thats just like the title of an old-fashioned detective story .
its difficult to say , exactly .
' eliza .
very good shes been to me always , auntie has .
she grasped the nail scissors firmly and began to dig out lumps of plasticine .
joyce , my dear girl .
this is suspicion that we talk nowwe have not yet come to proof .
i know , said poirot sympathetically .
she had her methods , said poirot drily .
he knocked at the door of a room , a brisk come in sounded from inside , and he opened the door and motioned to me to pass inside .
again there was a pause , as she searched him with her eyes .
miss marple pushed the cup away slightly .
miss johnson brushed the suggestion aside .
my mother had forbidden me strictly to accept a mount or ride .
dont mind me !
_num_ and accused the fellow of being a fraud .
she put him aside with a gentle hand and bent down .
proper remedial treatment , said rowena drake firmly .
you will find the hundred intact , i know , for mr .
four puffing at his pipe , colonel race looked speculatively at george barton .
for some reason or other the thing was getting on my nerves .
i entered the room , shut the door behind me and came across to the couch .
he explained his discovery of the few words on the charred fragment of paper .
dont , i said .
really , miss springerpoor miss springer , naturally it wasnt her faultbut , illogically , chaddy felt that it must have been her fault in some way .
mercy !
thats the one thing i do feel is necessary .
you see , it is too late for advice now .
i dont know how anyone manages to have money now , but theres a lot of it about .
this was escape at lastreal escape .
sir george himself , working through thompson ?
more than lingered .
but the bulk of the money always went to her nephew and his wife , and i think some other old cousin who was dead , though , by the time she died .
how tiresome !
she gets anxious and bleats .
thirteen a conference conferences !
it was possible that , despite julias appearance of cheerful common sense , her mother , too , might want to explain that her daughter was highly strung .
about philip , i mean .
who might tell me what i ought to do .
and did you remember him , miss blacklock ?
the great quartetteflora and faunawhat luck have you had todayeh ?
that i still can doin fact it is the only thing possible for me .
there , with annes assistance , he had had an interview with the parlourmaid .
she said the doll wanted to be loved , said sybil .
oh , rather , of course i have , said jimmy , endeavouring to cope with the situation .
she cried , with a deep accent of distress .
my mother took me gently to task .
i understandi am not , i hope , indiscreetthat you yourself are planning such an edifice ?
its funny your saying that .
i dont think its of any political significance , said tuppence .
roberts , but in the telephone book inchs taxi service was still the official name , and the older ladies of the community continued to refer to their journeys as going somewhere in inch , as though they were jonah and inch was a whale .
well , again , said dr .
his mother had just died .
lady clarke said suddenly : yesit was good of you to come .
then he spoke in a low , distinct voice : you could , perhaps , love a thief , mademoiselle , but not a murderer .
she protested .
they rush about the garden making noises like spaceships , you know , or rockets , or atom bombs .
without a word , boris produced a soiled scrap of paper , evidently torn from a letter , and handed it to anthony .
supposing i were to tell you somethingyou would not laugh ?
gladys .
then she turned on nofret .
japp pursed his lips .
she wrote one to herself , too ?
after all , he is an enemy alien , you know .
i wasnt prying .
but its all o .
there was something , some faint trace of self-consciousness in his voice which made mr .
his sister , who kept house for him , was a large woman rather like a female grenadier .
she had the usual two inoculationsand they may have been typhoid inoculations for all we know .
i suppose you can look at it that waybut it seems very unlikely of course it is unlikely !
doesnt make a frightful lot of difference either wayi mean as far as were concerned .
a shadow passed over the girls face .
not one suggestive lead .
it wasnt till mr .
he didnt show it to me .
those were the very words i used to myself as i drove down with taverner .
corrigan took the letter handed to him .
poirot spoke : you did not go to the studylater ?
by and by she said dreamily : it would be interesting to know how to write on papyrus .
hes stumped at present by my apparent lack of motive .
she would go in quietly , get the pearls and bring them out to me .
greta put in advertisements and got another couple almost at once .
she said : i cant be sure , but ill tell you i recognised someone the other day .
just a thick sort of knitted silkideal for the purpose .
can you give me an account of them ?
he was like his fatherhe was like no one but his father .
but i would likethat drink , she continued .
jerry had an expensive public school education , so he doesnt recognize latin when he hears it , said joanna .
miss lindstrom , dr .
a murder .
asked poirot , innocently .
but how stupid of me , she shouted .
then , miss peake , she said , do you remember what mr costello said just before he left ?
yes , we must begin again .
yahmose murmured with sudden despondency : i am dying .
i couldnt let janet and the children down .
my nephew and his wife are to accompany us .
that nurse hopkins , for instance !
and she herself here on the stairs between the two of them .
poirot was frowning thoughtfully .
did you talk about the murder at all ?
but it will be different now .
hank ryder .
do you remember old jeremy mentioning a chap called hercule poirot ?
asked miss marple , crinkling her brows .
well , he just sat around in the hotel lounge , reading the papers and so on , till it was time for dinner .
oh , the in has come off .
pierrot who has seen columbine and knows no rest .
i established the fact pretty clearly that none of his immediate family had met with a sudden death .
it is an odd feeling to have a book growing inside you , for perhaps six or seven years knowing that one day you will write it , knowing that it is building up , all the time , to what it already is .
she was speaking now to the restaurant attendant in a clear , courteous but completely autocratic tone .
some jewellery , i dont know much about that .
modified blackmail .
they stayed here for a day or two to get the hotel people accustomed to their presence .
the dead woman lay on the berth to their left , in so natural a posture that one could have thought her asleep .
' your methods of extracting scandalous matter .
jealousy .
she is an angel , said the young frenchman with fervour .
i will follow upon mine enemies and overtake them , neither will i turn again till i have destroyed them .
finally she picked up the receiver of the telephone and dialled with vigour .
quite simple .
there had been other moments when renisenb had held teti close to her , feeling the child still part of her own body , her own living flesh , with a passionate sense of ownership .
we have no time to lose .
and there was only one person whose general appearance lent itself to such an impersonation .
some wretched old woman knocked on the head for a few pounds .
either my driving or my fatal fascination !
we have time to waste here , it seems .
i dont like this housetheres some malign influence about it .
we are most grateful .
whos the victim in murder stories ?
but no offence taken , i hope ?
craddock gave a deep sigh .
evidemment , mademoiselle .
the eyes closed , then opened again .
walter fane , so quiet , so unemotional , who could express himself , perhaps , only in sudden murderous violenceas , possibly , quiet lizzie borden had once done .
he looked suddenly old and shaken .
i should think he was frightfully upright and all that , and devoted to his mother , and with a lot of virtues .
he laughedand i disliked the laugh .
i should give up thinking of edward if i were you .
well , ieri just slipped out for a minute , she said .
lorrimer , an elderly woman , but a woman in full possession of her wits and faculties .
truth to tell , miss marple could have done very well without them .
pah , cried poirot .
sheppard .
one cannot say more than that .
i remember being shown it as a girl .
but i felt that , after that , if people were talkingand evidently they must have been , or where did the writer get the idea from ?
the burly lunatic asylum keeper , the man in the buttoned-up overcoat in paris , james , the footman , the quiet young medical man in the yellow jasmine case , and the russian professor .
she was easy to satisfy .
the inspector turned to address him .
youll have to give us timeto get hold of the money .
a little overwhelming .
i hope so , too , said poirot mendaciously .
had a bit of an accident here once , you know .
i am five years older than joanna .
i prepared myself to observe the reactions of everyone .
tell me about yourself , gipsy girl .
such people are , as you say , very simplelike children .
quite a lot of it .
mon ami , i will answer you with one significant wordred !
the modesty of this remark had probably not been equalled before in poirots conversation .
wed talked in the street a little , that was all .
and yet rosamund was unusually beautiful and susan was attractive and full of sex appeal .
there you are wrong .
yes , indeed , said inspector neele , far more sensible .
he was beginning to take a fancy to anthony .
nothing of interest there .
as for eatables , you could ask for anything you likedand get it !
it was rather a wonderful sight .
then , with a laugh , he sprang back .
the genuine article ?
but the whole thing depends on me doing mine .
it would be poetic .
yes , sir , it will be about an hour and a halfs run .
that letter i handed to you- by mischance i put my hand into my right-hand pocket instead of the left- ' ' what ' s all this ?
though when i come to think of it , i said , would that matter , ellie ?
but for once mr .
i went out on to the terrace , a little disturbed in mind .
i bowed my head .
theyd notice itcouldnt help it .
_num_ : the worlds end in storyteller magazine , february _num_ .
well , then , you have no further need of me ?
the autumn sun fell pleasantly upon this retreat .
and then , gruffly .
that is just itit is impossiblequite impossiblethat an honourable , slightly stupid , upright englishman should stab an enemy twelve times with a knife !
no , really , miss marple , its no trouble at all .
a woman who did not easily forgive or forget .
youre nuts !
personally i should say two or three minutes , but i know by experience that my sense of time is not very good when i am absorbed and interested in what i am doing .
after that , continued japp , it took him about four days to overcome his natural distrust of getting mixed up with the police and come along with his information .
how much should you say they are worth ?
there are only two answers to that , mon cher .
he left her in the hall and withdrew to consult his master .
we were over the channel at the time .
in a flash josephine was at the window , her snub nose pressed to the pane .
hes a man of about sixty , good at his job and well-liked here .
poirot said : what were the movements of the other people on that morning ?
hes the kind of man who could write a book like those old cookery books , a hundred ways of evading the law .
robin upward confirms that .
he was , in any case , seldom interested by members of the human race .
anne ought to be protected .
really , id rather you didnt .
one end of it pointed one waybut the other end always points the opposite way .
dont you get mixed up with no eye-ties , i know what im talkin about .
looking round her , she felt there was a faint flavour of a buckingham palace garden party about the scene .
with all the excitement ?
bridget felt slightly sick .
the irritated demand as to why on earth your partner did not lead a certain card is entirely done away with , and though we still express criticisms frankly , there is not the same acrimonious spirit .
i mean , it is the natural thing to do , isnt it ?
i believe im correct in saying that a divorced woman gets no alimonyand mr barracloughs a very promising young actor , but hes not touching big money .
but you think its a pity ?
he only gets _num_ under the will and he seems all right .
have i not taken time and trouble to convict the real organizer of the dope racket .
they were interrupted .
her own entry into rosemarys sitting room , her sudden stop .
do you really know , poirot ?
poirot thought they were probably brown .
i forget whose production it was and who was playing macbeth , but there was a strong suggestion in that particular production , and macbeth certainly played it in a way to suggest that he was hinting to the medical attendant that lady macbeth would be better out of the way .
he was investigating the strange disappearance of an ambassadors boots and had a rendezvous fixed for half past two .
yes , i know , laura replied , as farrar lit their cigarettes .
he said : so we leave here tomorrow .
but what i came to say was that the inspector person is simply insisting that we should all come into the drawing room .
could a man shoot himself in such a way ?
yes , she thought , that was what despair was .
it might be just accusing mrs .
tuppence stroked the dark head .
many times , i expect .
no , no , you are wrong there .
he had no evidence to give .
i should like to hear it again from you .
they were fond of her but found her rather ridiculous .
yes , as soon as we got into the room .
it was unromantic but very comfortable .
trotter started , the revolver wavereda voice shouted , down , mrs .
cassetti .
you did not then expect to see him again that evening ?
but thats not quite true , is it ?
going to the library door , he held it open , and turned to address sir rowland .
what do you want me to say about her ?
he poured out a torrent of words in some foreign language .
some books that ive read these last few years have brought a lot of comfort to me .
i dont know if any of them are likely to be what you want .
and so you thought of making an edging of them to a bed .
who is she , this ellen ?
phillipa haymes was at work .
only the stronger sex has to get out and heave .
how nice you are to me , said aspasia glen .
but i dare say i can find out , she added hopefully .
bouc with a characteristic gestureshe is a terrible old lady , that !
only her husbands .
group i : andrew pennington group ii : mrs .
now let me see if you at least know your lines .
i can only remember bits of it .
come , child , dont go on playing the coward .
he was so impressed .
renauld hints strongly that his business is private .
did edith de haviland know , or suspect , that philip was guilty .
no , conversation with gregory had failed .
the housemaid and the detective , after all , have something in common .
it demonstrates , incidentally , the profound truth that seeing is not believing .
the lights of the candles were very flickering and uncertain and the only person who would examine me closely was armstrong .
fullerton looked somewhat surprised .
now are you sure you wouldnt like some coffee or something first ?
what a lovely little boat that is out there with the red sails .
he circled the house at a discreet distance .
and there was beatrice ardley and cathie grant , who is dim as they make and a couple of useful women , of course .
i think in some way he was jealous of it because it was a part of my life that i hadnt shared with himit was all my own .
sir rowland and jeremy murmured acknowledgements .
i dont think it isnot really .
since we know that he was desperately hard up for a matter of five hundred pounds .
my voice was sceptical .
it is , madame , that i make the inquiriesthe private inquiries , you understand ?
she looked round the kitchena big , comfortable kitchen that seemed to call for a big , comfortable cook presiding at the kitchen table , her jaws moving rhythmically as she ate rock cakes and drank black teashe should be flanked by a tall , elderly parlormaid on one side and a round , rosy housemaid on the other , with a kitchenmaid at the other end of the table observing her betters with frightened eyes .
blore said : he probably will .
shoves in begonias and geraniums and lobelia edging .
do you know , said poirot with a sudden change of tone , that i find you very good to look at .
wheres the next draw ?
you have not yet appreciated the truth of this matter .
i went in to see him on my way down to dinner .
ive got all that pretty correspondence , including the one about the cachet .
threatened me ?
sergeant phillips said : i think ive been over every inch of the beach , sir .
' ' and now , my friend , ' said poirot as we stepped towards the .
her friendships with men .
at least , not as far as we could see .
what does your gallery think ?
ill wait for the inquest , then !
theyre paid for their artfulness and twisting things this way and that .
she choked her fears down bravely .
and immediately on his left , with a basket of eggs in her hand , was his hostess , lady angkatell .
they had walked for perhaps a minute when they overtook a figure going in the same direction .
no actor can just quietly collapse and fall down dead .
(was she crazy , she wondered , what on earth was urging her on to talk like this ?
taking the lion necklace from the jewel box , renisenb hid it in the folds of her linen dress .
the trouble with you is , theres no holding youn or mall over again .
missed him , said sir henry .
it seemed an eternity before the stolid helmeted figure of a police constable came round the corner of the house .
she worked for a small commercial firm that does consumer research .
have you ever reflected , madame , on the enormous part that hearsay plays in life .
it was just something she said she was worried about .
she was trembling a little , and her nice pink cheeks had lost some of their colour .
first boy , said mrs bantry , pointing a finger at sir henry .
i exhorted sinners to repentance .
thank you , mr warrender , the inspector said abruptly and dismissively , patting the cushion back into place on the sofa .
it has watertight compartments .
a simplified dinner had been served , and by mutual consent the house party had retired to their rooms after it .
almost more beautiful than the arno ?
and what did she mean when she said , the other , yes , but not this .
as he spoke raymond was congratulating himself on having thought of greenshaws folly as a means of entertaining his guest .
the andover murder had created little interest .
iii dr mcculloch looked round him , a little uncertain of what he was going to do or say next .
but not one of you offered to do so .
miss marple frowned .
the man and wife who attended on your uncle are still there , i presume ?
renauld ?
you have spoken just now of an english lady , miss slater , who interested herself in works of charity .
youve only got to say .
and i am not dr .
he comes from the northfrom the same part of egypt as nofret .
she held the radiator while jeremy plugged its lead into the socket , and then she put it down on the floor .
then there was no window cleaner ?
it might have been a mistake or an accident .
just sometimes i was afraid of her because she did things sometimes without telling me .
thats the cat , i said .
challenger frowned .
of her remaining children , edward was in ceylon , lloyd was in south africa , and stephen was third officer on the angolia .
his face grew suddenly sad and rather stern .
' don ' t go , annie , ' she cried .
neither of them have said anything .
with a slight sigh the old lady rose to her feet .
lydia said gently : i am so glad to come to know you and david at last .
which i have , you knowa great-unclea poppet and id hate him to die , but the fact came in useful .
its a respectable family .
the customs , as usual , very trying at dover .
full facilities will be given you for communicating with your solicitor .
miss spenser shook her head .
demanded dering uneasily .
you said you were staying down there , i remember , with a friend of course , said miss cooke .
the hero spoke .
it had slipped down behind the table .
glad to see you back again .
my dear , i said , i hope youll be very happy .
joan prescott ?
dreadfully puzzling .
if he is not there then , he asks that you will wait until he comes .
julia muttered an impolite continental expression under her breath and stalked to the front door .
all those letters were typed by one particular machine .
his forefinger stroked his upper lip and his voice was dangerously polite .
when japp emerged into harley street he was smiling to himself in a pleased fashion .
i see poirot paused and then went on : were you surprised at mr .
the virgin white of the sheet of paper was defaced by a title written in capital letters .
supposing , said the inspector , watching her closely , that someone was to say that you had been seen talking to rudi scherz ?
does that strike you as a satisfactory solution ?
one of them rang up the other and asked him to come hereto throw suspicion on himbut we dont know which .
youve got me .
and now i come to think of it ive never actually come across anyone who knew bletchley before he came down here .
similarly , if the corpse is found in a sealed room , naturally i say , ha !
hori stood quite still for a moment , then as he walked by renisenbs side , back towards the house , he said , i see .
easterbrook reproachfully , are you going to say you werent with me ?
thats what you mean , isnt it ?
poirot was in his most unapproachable mood , lost in a kind of reverie .
he paused , then added , as it happens , theres a slight fog in london .
a woman , eh ?
sitting there in the dock so calm and gentle .
i did not see mrs .
at the moment its guesswork .
accusingly , he held out a pink bus ticket .
llewellyn-smythe had a great dislike of typed letters being sent to friends or anything like that .
but the dramatic possibides of the story struck me at once .
you knew that you were coming here ?
hed never think of connecting it with the murder .
wimborne who compressed his thin lips and shook his head with distaste .
get on with the usual stuffphotographs , fingerprints , etc .
rang three times , he did , before i could get to it .
do you not think it bears a marked resemblance to your own handwriting ?
see , she catches him upa slim young woman , in a widows veil .
he may just grow up to ordinary everyday happiness .
sticking an eyeglass in his eye , he looked coldly round the room , his glance resting longest on poirot , who was gazing at him with a kind of simple , innocent admiration which was most pleasing to the counts vanity .
or else it suggests , as our friend the chef de train insisted , a woman .
just now , in speaking to your wife , i asked her who could have written or inspired those letters .
patriotism or ruthless requisitioning had swept these away .
these women get my goat !
my uncle left a most extraordinary will .
no pride in his work , crump hasnt .
tell me everything .
elsie jumped up and ran to harold .
sherfield , yes .
then he noticed that the girl was terribly nervous .
vera cried : but this is fantasticmad !
the doctor , with a shrug of his shoulders and a little bow , left the room .
i was a darned idiot , muttered julius gloomily .
he is more amorous than discreet , you understand poirot broke off with an innocent air .
get up at once , arthur , and go downstairs and see about it .
poirot said : no , it is as you say .
enjoyed it .
theyre never used .
then , while he is arguing with the guard , and making a big scene , and all the train is agog with interest , you and i will fade quietly away .
ah , you have made sure of that ?
he was full of anxiety on her behalf .
crome elicited the fact that the man , when seen sneaking across the yard , had had no bag or suitcase .
who locked up the jewel case ?
my father nodded his head gently .
poirot , said miss lemon patiently .
i remember it all so well , said mrs .
whatever she had expected , it was not this .
carlile whether you are or not good-looking and he replies that he does not know !
quite naturally so , poirot thought .
she cried plaintively .
she sat very still , staring down at the carpet , then she raised her head and looked at him steadily .
he began to feel that he might possibly enjoy the party after all .
yes , sir , regular upset so nervous she didnt seem to know what she was saying .
he was a young man , only forty-three .
you know what hes like when he thinks a cat is around .
a sort of mild horseplay to get the children warmed up .
dont lets split hairs , i said impatiently .
closer investigation confirmed the impression that it had made on me the night before .
yes , a delightful surprise .
you are a certificated district nurse and you reside at rose cottage , hunterbury ?
what is russia likely to do ?
hell want to make sure that youre quite all right again .
a woman incapable of murder ?
the girls eyes were very bright and she had a vivid patch of colour in each cheek .
because you showed me how .
dermot craddock sighed .
hes got a chance now of real happiness .
the bitterness of the coffee would have masked the bitter taste of the taxine .
not really her stylebut just right for concealing the scar .
unwillingly the couple fell apart .
you were through it , i suppose ?
bigger houses have a real conservatory .
the news from geneva is not very good .
already no doubt he has made love to her and he has no doubt he can make her do what he wants .
how far had matters gone between her and ellsworthy ?
its the giselle side that wants going into .
yes its frightfully odd , because i dont know who helen isbut at the same time i do knowi mean i know that it was helen lying there how am i going to find out more ?
had been an invalid for some time .
she isnt the type .
one of his best .
its important that .
you are about to give me one of those wonderful descriptive portraits of yours , he murmured , that is so , is it not ?
a big boulder hurtling down the cliff crashed past them .
she began to sob hysterically .
that makes it look as though its the way we think it is .
his bath was prepared , and as he lay luxuriating in the hot water , his mind went back over the conversation with his daughter .
he looked thoughtful for a moment .
the door opened and bessner appeared .
come in , mr .
his voice came purringly from between his lips .
tuppence said despairingly : i feel so futileso inexperienced .
tea .
but what earthly reason could there be giles broke off , and trotter said , thats just what im here to find out .
the colouring was that of simeon lees wife , but there was a spirit , a vivacity that those mild blue eyes and placid features had never known .
morphiathe barbiturates .
pauvre enfant , said poirot .
still , it may admit of a perfectly simple explanation .
i cant breathe .
but you couldnt find the stamp , clarissa guessed aloud , backing away from him .
josie warmed to this sympathy .
meaning , you want me to be the postman ?
her niece gets that .
but now it is patrick calling .
by it mrs .
come on , lets have tea .
itit was so very unenglish .
and i actually remember his mentioning one stampan eighteen fifty-one blue two cent .
rose .
psychologically perfect .
she was a trained hospital nurse .
she went on fiercely : what do you think its been like all the evening , sitting round , with john dead and nobody caring but me and gerda !
he pushed back his chair .
he closed the connecting door and resumed his place in the right-hand corner .
this is the man who murdered little daisy armstrongcassetti .
i dont know who the child was or where she came from but i suppose the governess was looking after her .
she lost her hair in a fever when she was eighteen .
they are quite sincere and very earnest , i believe , and mrs spenlow was impressed by it all .
you are going away ?
so you know better than they do ?
he had suffered too often crossing the channel to have any illusions about the strength of his stomach afloat .
butbut why ?
though probably they were mostly untrue .
vitamins , you know , or at least thats what it says on the tin .
and theres mary talks about being a nurse , too .
i dont know what you mean , hori .
i had a very difficult time with kelvin in the morning , but he realized at last that it was a delusionor at least he said he did , and he consented to go into a nursing home for treatment .
irene grosvenor .
a very good morning , said mortimer , smiling .
three of the people i loved best and who made up my homemy world !
it was impossible and i was going to forbid it absolutely .
i have an idea , said bryan martin slowly .
look here ; do you think one of us ought to stay just to keep an eye on things till the police come ?
thank goodness i know my work in the theatre well enough .
i wondered if youd think of that , sir .
they knew nothing of what she , amy carnaby , could do !
tuckerton rang for tea .
she cant help it , of course , but it really makes things a little difficult sometimes .
but not this sort of thing .
caspar , said miss cooke .
suggested mortimer quietly .
when nurse changed the bottles , she held the sal ammoniac against the wallpaper for a minute , i expect .
yes , said stillingfleet .
a kipper ?
upjohn , but did not ask her to sit .
i put him down at once as one of the strong silent men of rhodesia .
she really had the ivory pallor that anthony had so often written about .
care to dance , mr raynor ?
nobody hated herim sure of it .
you use it to bait a mousetrap .
last autumn .
he was a man of about forty-five , dressed in a dark , shabby suit .
and theres nothing you can tell me , no hint edna might have given to you ?
how she wished she had field glasses with her .
whatin the other house ?
not what you saybut i dont know that i blame her .
moreover it was only two and a half guineas as against three and a half a week .
llewellyn-smythe to possess such a garden of her own , to have the pleasure of taking an unkempt quarry set in this smug , tidy , elementary and essentially conventional countryside of that part of england .
she had said to him : but could you ever do that ?
not unless there is some relevance to the case , which , i may say , seems unlikely .
he sat down and looked inquiringly at the superintendent .
just the sort of mistake one does make when youre trying to remember a car number .
people dont want to knowif truth is unpalatable .
ive the right of caring for youwhat did you say just now ?
that letter was written more than ten or eleven days ago .
shell be up for tiffin and if the poor devils found to be absent without leave , therell be ructions .
i am sure , said mrs .
he looked down at it .
no , certainly not .
you found it a little heavy , perhaps ?
a halting question was promptly answered by poirot .
anyway what theyre looking for usually is the foreigners that are coming in , not the british lot .
proceeds of the bedhampton train robbery .
oh dear , i must go very , very fast .
how could they ?
i thought the chief constable was going to have apoplexy .
we were very happy together , said pat .
i dont want to be here .
you know how , no woman better .
i watched her through the crack of the hinge .
i accept your word that you didnt spill ink deliberately on elizabeths notes .
he was at the stage of a meal when one becomes philosophic .
the idea seemed so fantastic at the time that miss grey spoke of it to no one .
armstrongarmstrongit is difficult to recallone met so many .
it all interested me very much , mr .
madge , he felt certain , would lose her money .
then she meets nevile on the tennis courts , makes a dead set at him and never rests until she gets him to leave his wifeof whom he was extremely fondand go off with her !
not that i know of , sir .
yes , lady matilda ?
what we need , therefore , is a reasonable commonsense theory which will link those three deaths togetherin other words those three crimes were committed by one and the same person , and were to the advantage and benefit of that particular person .
more than usual .
because , said poirot , it means either there was nothing to find out , and that , let me tell you , does not accord with the facts ; or else something was being very cleverly concealed .
i said griselda had taken it very well .
but they must be worththey must be worth her imagination failed .
it slipped out .
anyone would think he was a dry stick with no feelings at all .
lets have your deductions , hastings .
father said thoughtfully : i thought he said the walls of jericho .
oh , damn it all , one must be honest , yes !
i have a commission for you , my friend , he said at last .
i cant see any reason for lawrence behaving like a perfect idiot .
oh well , im always fond of travelling , i like seeing countries .
i am intrigued and interested .
this letter business .
he recovered himself quickly .
she wasnt bad .
i left the shop elated .
but it might do a great deal of harm , she said .
i really do not know sometimes how you manage these things .
i expect its my husband , said susan , jumping up .
to attempt a thing like that would be quite crazy .
i feel certain that it wasnt in any way miss lawsons doingim sure shed be quite incapable of scheming and intriguing again , i agree with you , madame .
if youll be sure to latch that door properly .
then the birth of her children and her passionate attachment to them .
i may be stupid , but i can count how many beans are planted to a row .
' ' tout de mme , lord mayfield , it would not look well if i were known that the plans of britain ' s new bomber had beet stolen during a weekend when a certain very charming lady ha been your guest .
it was so thrilling .
again he dived for a book .
your father disapproved ?
i swear we didnt , david .
lawton , for your frankness in what you have told me .
after good mornings had been exchanged and luke had sat down with a plentifully heaped plate of eggs and bacon , he began : i must get to work , he said .
two miles if you go by the footpath over the links .
im not really , i said truthfully .
inglethorp was lying on the bed , her whole form agitated by violent convulsions , in one of which she must have overturned the table beside her .
to get in touch with commander x ?
i had a fine strong soprano voice , about the only soprano they had , and i was naturally in the seventh heaven at being chosen to play colonel fairfax .
nicoletis to bed with a sedative and calmed down geronimo and maria , i shall have a little time .
fitzwilliam , why you bring the hortons into this ?
that , it annoys me very much .
you have no idea yourself , i suppose ?
and i thought maybe as miss olga had murdered the old lady because she knew all this money was coming to her and then she got the wind up when there was a fuss and lawyers and the police , maybe , and so she ran away .
well , we start with a few plain statements of facts .
have i an enemy , i ask myself ?
the last obstacle to our union is removed .
did he stay here ?
edmundson considered .
roberts straight away yes ?
some have come home to this country .
i demanded of her the address of m .
dash it all , theyve all been sitting round looking at each other for the last two weeks .
they dont know the old rhyme , she explained .
poirot looked at her thoughtfully as he asked : has she threatened you in actual words in public ?
id got home .
ring up all over the country to say theyve seen a missing personand nine times out of ten theres no resemblance even to the printed description !
thats half the battle .
i wonder why i shouldnt have thought hed take it that way , would you ?
i had that text pinned over my bed when i was a little girl : ask and you shall receive .
madeleine and mr .
if you would use your grey cells , and see the whole case clearly as i do , you too would perceive it , my friend .
the man at the smithy has a car of a kind , i believe .
the laws the law .
shall we come to the point , m .
so that there is every reason to suppose that mr farley committed suicide .
meet them all again .
now then , he asked , what really did happen this evening ?
you know theres a place halfway where its easier to turn it ?
i am rather .
he hasnt hinted any suspicion of such a thing to the police .
liked to make herself out a fool , but wasnt really .
various ruts and jars in the road awoke her .
how old was shetwenty-one ?
well , jason rudd stalled , uncertain what to say , then he accepted the position , and what do you want me to do for you , miss marple ?
kennedy rose to receive them .
if i choose .
i loved you from the first moment i saw you standing there in your little black suit .
that bloom of seventeenwonderful !
blunt has been rather indiscreet , im afraid .
of the inhabitants of sans souci , three had been out at the time of tommys return .
men will not be nice to you if you are not good-looking , and women will not be nice to you if you are .
endersleigh street itself is a small street sandwiched between two larger streets in the neighbourhood of oxford circus .
as a matter of fact they met me at london airport .
oh , well , he said vaguely .
what do you come and waste your time for ?
it is so , is it not ?
the commissary of police , he is without doubt within ?
it was hannah .
is that really so , poirot ?
for , you see , the rot is in the department itself .
she relaxed , and abandoning her knitting , let thoughts pass in an idle stream through her headselina hazywhat a pretty cottage she had had in st .
supper at the savoy with mr .
now then , you old dog .
and then he asked me to tell snell that m .
oh , renisenb , you cannot be angry with me for that ?
and it was carried through the country by those two wandering cinema menthe ones we actually met ?
she was in england for a fortnights holiday .
hilary sat back on the low divan , thinking of the future .
that ridiculous box of chocolates .
one girl stood alone , slightly apart from the rest .
serrocold nodded .
why did you kill her ?
it was addressed , as i saw by leaning forward , to messrs greatorex and hanbury .
that was too bad , he said , as she finished , having , perhaps , made a more detailed story of it than seemed strictly necessary .
she had certain potentialities .
he calculated .
for a moment or two i lost thread of his stumbling sentences , for enlightenment had come to me .
a man who became friends with the girl , a girl who , if a will had been accepted when submitted to probate , would have inherited the larger part of a vast fortune .
and i saw your advertisement , being out of a shop for the moment , and , my time being my own , i said to myself : there , they want to know about poor old claudielawyers , toomaybe its a fortune looking for the rightful heir .
he went to where the wine jar still stood in the stand .
llewellyn-smythe died a natural death ?
un peu despoir , un peu de rve , et puis bonsoir .
it was time we got hold of something .
i thought you might do that , said mr .
i accept your assurance that you want to help in the solving of this girls murder .
it was this way , your ladyship .
trouble with him is that hes so confoundedly touchy , said major horton .
weve got to be careful .
i should say , said charles , that a really bullying k .
and so the answer to you is no .
she kept saying that one didnt know anything about him .
children have to learn about it , have to grow up with it .
nobody matters but usthats what you mean ?
im afraid its quite true .
i was too tired to remember .
my dear giles , youve fallen into the trap againthe trap of believing what is said to you .
she availed herself of a small paper knife which mr .
it must be the excitement .
he was silent for a moment or two , whilst his eyes made a thoughtful survey of the young man opposite him .
just round the corner .
so far that fits .
she plunged across the road , turned to the right , and then to the left , up harley street , finally pausing by the block of flats always airily described by mrs .
elsa stared .
i find the subject very useful .
oh its legal all rightas far as it goes .
but what are we going to do ?
one of the great joys of _num_ northwick terrace was mrs woods .
not to little renisenb .
so one had to examine that possibility .
and the odd part of it is that they are actually very dissimilar in character .
but well call it the mind , or the subconscious self , or any term that suits you better .
not by a long way !
say ?
but it does , said miss marple .
led away by the romantic spirit , and by the sound of her own language , she had impulsively lent aid to what was probably an extremely dangerous criminal .
venables is a man of distinctly unusual appearance , that is extremely valuable knowledge to have .
lennox paused a minute .
id like a word with himyes , please .
he leaped into fame with the startling discovery of ze fission .
the amount of adventures that , according to her own account , happened to her in a year was simply incredible .
are you angry with me , laura ?
monday , is it ?
all was sentiment and high ideals .
the way seemed endless .
dick windyford had come to her stammering with rage and anger .
you die so that beauty should live .
perhaps he meant a hired car , i suggested .
someone you were surprised to see ?
the ticket collector came along and i bought megan a return ticket .
yes , and what have we got ?
ive an idea that mr .
very beautiful ?
it was my bath .
so then , you see , i was in a regular quandary .
im not a complete mug , superintendent battle .
it must be the man who is staying in the village , she said .
poirot said : the very first night i was herethe night of the murderi saw a ghost .
yesi did see him .
but he felt still that strange disinclination to move , that new queer lassitude of the will .
there was a rich swedish business man with a glamour girl .
thats wallshire .
deborah enjoyed her job , though she found it made somewhat strenuous demands on her powers of concentration .
and my things ?
shall i see if its in the cabin , cousin marie ?
elinor sat up in bed .
yes , but lets go on .
that theres nothing the matter with mr .
the asides over , mrs .
asked tim .
poirot said : in your theory , where does amberiotis come in ?
why , no , thank you , miss jones .
marshall said : shes not in her room .
poirot gallantly forbode to remind mrs .
whos this private eye ?
it is a holy city , said the hajji .
ii hercule poirot walked along the dark mews looking up at the numbers .
kew gardens .
god knows .
i could not sleep , began the countess .
' the air marshal said abruptly : ' know anything about this vanderlyn woman ?
thats right , said sergeant oconnor .
but youve had other successes since then .
theres something worries him , said tommy .
and he was refusing .
sir henryi am so glad .
i mean , you cant exactly tell people you havent got a thing .
if you ask me its usually because they find theyre no longer as attractive as they used to be to men .
he said crisply : im going to set to work and learn every european language there is !
because if they had really said good-bye to each other , as they pretended , they would have looked very different .
they usually say that , too , said alistair blunt in a voice of even deeper gloom .
including our lunatic at large ?
it had been more the rule than the exception .
he had a heavy coat on so that i couldnt judge his build very well .
an ostrich feather one .
some of mrs .
such a hard life as shed had , too .
miss robinson complied .
id describe him as a man who had staked heavily and won against well-nigh overwhelming odds .
oh , i dont mean that i shant have to go away a lot .
the gong sounded from the house .
the man wore english clothes of loose tweedbut he was not english .
no waitingno preparation .
she brought the word out like the flick of a whip .
as for augustus , we have taught him a new trick .
meaning that he died by the result of his own actions , though not by his own hand ?
theres any amount of evidence against her black and plain for all the world to see !
cant beyouve got the wrong word .
i shall dance hung over with jewelsah !
why , that lot would murder him as soon as look at him .
and then when she was found all burnt up in that caroh !
suddenly , at the last moment , he swung round .
the desk was full , and there were some in a drawer in her bedroom , but there was nothing of importance amongst them .
or possibly a bus .
nazorkoff nodded .
cedric , leaning against the pigsty wall .
of course it was all very confusing her being found in colonel bantrys library , altogether too like a book to be true .
he said to mr .
straight from the hospital , so the manager said .
she felt horribly ill , and her throat was paining her badly .
yes , my lord , but go and tell mr .
in the end he decided he should take her wholly into his confidence .
no one actually saw him pass anything to her , but he might have done so .
hmi think theres only one thing for it .
well , we will look into the matter for you , mr .
sir james kleek said , let me get you a drink , nye ?
may have been lying around here for weeks .
i dont find it dull .
you were in the literary web and you werent good at this sort of stuff .
everything of that kind had either been destroyed or taken away .
dont like it !
you have heard that your master has been murdered ?
a common factor appears to be that on every occasion some pleasant harmless-seeming woman calls with a questionnaire on behalf of a domestic research unit .
and suppose i do not want to come ?
shortly afterwards the train slowed down and finally stopped .
david said abruptly : i dont know .
i am merely putting before you a certain point of view .
rather a duck , old mr .
twelve tommy meets an old friend from the opposite side of the road , tommy surveyed the premises of messrs .
you can see shalmaneser building up his zoo , sending back foreign animals from his campaigns , trying out new plants and trees .
tanios calls on us no sooner had we left the house than poirots manner changed .
i thought you were a burglar at first .
i cant see that it really matters , she said .
a moment of inattention , a brake that failed to hold , andover the edgedowndowndown .
what did you make them swear ?
have you worked for her before ?
said tommy , and wondered why he put it that way .
my wife wants me to give her a divorce so that she can marry another chap .
this title was previously published as the patriotic murders and an overdose of death .
and you didnt find anything ?
no , 	there was more than that .
i never know when youre going to turn up , he said .
he jumped out of the boat and she followed him .
you laugh at all sorts of serious things .
then whoever comes into a place cant afford to keep it up and has to sell but mrs .
the flow went on .
no , not exactly .
she saw something but she didnt realize its true significance .
he came in accompanied by the doctor , having left the constable below .
shes not in my class .
and , wheres your mistress ?
years oldcenturies old .
it beats me why you havent been there already .
jeremy returned from the library , closing the door carefully behind him .
again and again a mother takes a dislike to one of her children .
already he was late .
i still cant see what good this is going to achieve , richard persisted .
then you knew what you were going to find ?
there is a certain cardiac weakness , continued the doctor fluently , but nothing to be alarmed about .
no , sir , i havent seen her .
youll have to say youre over twenty-one .
twelve i is anything worrying you , mon ami ?
in rapid professional tones , the erstwhile mr .
why wont you tell me ?
we never believednone of us thought .
i get scared .
by various operations of grafting and delicate manipulation of the brain , they are arriving gradually at a state where docility can be assured and the will can be controlled without necessarily affecting mental brilliance .
he took up the receiver .
we have still two possible clues .
my letters are the duplicate of hers .
he looked dignified but rather disgusted with life .
you can tell me how that friend of yours is getting on with his booklife of general arundell ?
he was a shorh broad-shouldered young roan , with good-tempered blue eyes .
alix was roused from her thoughts by the sharp ringing of the telephone bell from within the house .
mrs macatta was a woman of great earnestness of purpose .
you know , frankie .
he stood looking at her steadily and his gaze did not falter .
yes , said tommy , yes , i can see that .
i am really very distressed .
did you overhear the quarrel at all ?
on the small table formed by the lid of the washing basin were various objectsfalse teeth in a glass of water ; another glass , empty ; a bottle of mineral water , a large flask and an ashtray containing the butt of a cigar and some charred fragments of paper ; also two burnt matches .
and commander challenger ?
he had a small dark beard and very piercing grey eyes , and an ease and assurance of manner which placed him among the higher ranks of the professional classes .
morley and say as mr .
she took two aspirins with a drink of water .
it is deficient in a dozen minor points .
he forebore to add that those had also been her questions .
i know you are , said tommy .
the costume .
it doesnt make sense , does it ?
midge turned on her .
he probably thought shed destroyed it .
ill make you listen to me , yelled edgar .
i saw mrs .
another of them , since leaving the university , had interested himself in politics .
having climbed the stairs we came to a door with genevieve .
you are one of the best antagonists , mademoiselle , that i have ever had .
but this letter of sir gervases to m .
let the evil of it be purified there .
i mean particularly a shock to her , because she doesnt understand violence .
so there was nothing more to consider .
very sorry i cant help you , mr .
and thats really the answer to the whole thing , because , you see , german measles is extremely infectious .
very thorough , said mr .
and with a determined look on his face , superintendent battle came out and joined them , shutting the door behind him .
burton , is typical of that of most men .
a girl of medium height , stocky in build , wearing what he had not appreciated at the time were very expensive clothes , but wearing them with a dowdy air .
we believe that linnet ridgeways unexpected marriage put you in a financial quandary .
its jimmy , said bundle .
no , no , mon ami .
pen-knife .
we know the hotel at which she is staying and we can keep in touch with her through thibault .
what does she take in the way of medicines ?
the strain of what ?
im not satisfied .
she had a great power of love and hate but no stability .
ididnt feel really illand i thought i just must this is vodka , mrs .
first murderer ?
i made him take it away .
all these descriptions , she would say at various points in sir walter scott .
shoved an oilskin packet into my hand which hed always worn next his skin .
_num_ whilst he was sipping it with long sighs of enjoyment , chantry came in and drank several pink gins in rapid succession .
nobody could blame me for that .
spence brought out the word with an air of finality .
perhaps because in the years of her childhood she had been quiet , restrained , with her emotions kept well below the surface , she tended to see the world in terms of drama that came near , sometimes , to melodrama .
you have left me a clearly written account of things ?
there was the hallmark of absolute honesty about thelma andersen .
i dont think hell mind .
he watched her closely , but this time there was no flicker of recognition .
only the gods really know the word ingratitude .
i shouldnt have said there was any of course about it , but one must believe what the patient tells one .
she lived with him near leeds , and had a son .
quite a young fellow , he is , halliday by name .
anything else would be too much of aa coincidence .
the things he has in that house of his represent a fantastic amount of money .
burrows immediately after them .
he was looking doubtfully at caroline , and then he stared at elsa .
coming to dine ?
she is not going to die ?
must get exercise every day .
why a solicitor ?
ill come down and see for myself , said elspeth .
because if ridgeway merely opens the packet and finds it a dummy , suspicion flies at once to london .
on the day of mrs .
satterthwaite , i really believe in christianitynot like mother does , with little books and early service , and thingsbut intelligently and as a matter of history .
she said : ohoh , yes !
suddenly we came out on a grassy ridge overlooking the sea and a beach of glistening white stones .
he seemed distrait .
another bill .
you brought only one candle into the room ?
miss marple makes a visit _num_ .
i wonder , said ellie , i wonder she looked hard at me .
agatha christie the man in the brown suit .
of the few friends of the old daysjust a chosen fewwas it likely that any of them would recognize him now if they were to meet him face to face ?
lady julia flung her head back and said firmly : i heard nothing .
as soon as youd won your bet , i meant to give it to celia and ask her to put it back .
he thought a minute .
you know a little more about money .
didnt know anyone knew .
i fancy its true all right , said narracott with a grin .
but probably they put the bright boys on to it .
all these years i refused to live with that idea .
ask her if shes a widow ?
it was almost a royal command .
so shes done it then !
the word exact , you are zealous for it .
james bentley said vaguely : i think it was that woman whose son writes plays .
susan went back to the cottage .
you saw her in court , perhaps ?
but it cannot be genuine unlessand now we come to two very interesting speculations .
elliss pince-nez .
you know , theres more of it if only i could remember .
hardly like to hide em in either of these , said the colonel .
you did not see anyone at the church itselfthe vicar , or the verger ?
as a matter of form , you would perhaps give me an account of your movements during the evening and night of the _num_ th .
he was unconscious .
and let you go into danger without me by your side ?
then , by way of a change , he shook it .
four third month of inundation _num_ th day imhotep listened to sobeks explanation of the sale of the timber in ominous silence .
spragg may be all that she claims to be .
again poirot turned that appraising glance upon her .
lucy set to work systematically the next afternoon .
betrothment ?
satterthwaite panting behind him .
and she and mr .
she had been walking with ralph paton , and i had been surprised because i had had no idea that he was likely to be in kings abbot .
blore said doubtfully : it might have been thrown into the sea .
she added , i dont like elizabeth whittaker much .
id swear there was something .
they mightnt be discreet , you know , and discretions rather important .
sex appeal , said jane .
but morley couldnt have been shot later than one oclock , he saysprobably considerably earlierbut he wouldnt be definite .
perhaps she isnt really lucy eyelesbarrow at all , suggested cedric .
what came to you ?
her recognition was quite positive .
no , said major finney , rather unwillingly .
y .
the butler had returned with the books .
miss waynflete murmured , i see .
she came a step nearer .
oh you do ?
i understood him , and i was sorrybecause im the same underneath .
strange that she had never married again after leos death .
he felt that tremendous issues lay in his hands .
but i may mention to you in confidence that our suspicions are confirmed .
oh well , i shall be glad to get to bed .
but i knew one thing nowthat mrs .
then why did you go to the three boars last night ?
we dont like getting old , thats what it is , said haydock gently .
i was quite content for her to hate us , or rather mei dont think she disapproved of archie quite so much .
no , certainly not , farrar retorted indignantly .
or possibly rogers is lying !
for instance , the servant question .
my dear fellow i know what im saying .
he pausedthen said in a sudden rush of agitation , it is difficultvery difficult .
there i am ashamed .
her eyes were very bluethe colour of forget-me-nots .
well , a basis for negotiations , shall we say ?
certain facts have come to light which are bound to show him up in a most unfavourable light .
hubert came and picked her up at the hotel in the morning .
clayton .
so gradually a little picture grew up in chief inspector japps mind .
between two oclock and four thirty , is his official medical verdict .
whos in authority here ?
the judge said : we are now assured of one thing .
wren ?
i purposely kept my conversation as matter-of-fact as possible .
poirot brought forward two chairs and urged them to sit down .
we can arrange such facts as we have with order and method .
id love to be married from here , lucy , she said .
horse chestnutchestnut horse , she boomed at him .
how extraordinary , how very extraordinary .
this building has been purposely built in a confusing manner .
they are driving her mad .
have you absolutely no idea of who killed two of my mistresses in the sports pavilion ?
lorrimers voice cut into the air like ice .
i went over the case again minutely , and i came to the same conclusion as before .
you mean these baker street societies and all that , said miss lemon .
i have my cigarette case on me .
its about something elsesomething i asked her that she was to let me know about .
afterwards we will go on with this .
quin so clearly before his mind .
it lasted some time and was heated and acrimonious .
iscould i speakis miss hardcastle here ?
talk about photographs , i mean ?
she chose the latter course and went swiftly and somewhat precariously to where the wall turned at right angles .
i shall never have a professional attitude or remember the exact dates of the assyrian kings , but i do take an enormous interest in the personal aspects of what archaeology reveals .
and i think she said that would do quite well .
why , he wondered , had she been so firm ?
molly ' ll tell you he ' s always here tuesdays and thursday nights .
have you found any clues ?
after a minute or two he said : know what i think ?
last night ?
was it halliday whom madame olivier received ?
i think he may have beenkilled .
you know how rumours get around , get magnified .
his mother was only interested in men .
but i know you , beresford , and i know our mrs .
she was prostratedyes ?
i dont believe for a moment in spirits or anything like that .
because , in all this house of mourning , yours are the only eyes that have wept .
so lets go .
thesiger went over to the window , he was so still that she thought he must have left the room and gone outside .
ted latimer fidgeted .
not mrs .
really dangerous .
in your judgment , do you think she might have changed her mind after her conversation with you ?
shall i put it in the garage , sir ?
also , i fancied that the afternoon sunlight would be far more attractive in effect .
perhaps she made it all up as a kind of fantasy first .
now what did that bring to my mind ?
unfortunately now , she was no longer sleepy .
crale had not come up to the house for lunch as he wanted to get certain effects of light on the stoneand the sun would have been wrong for this later .
nothing can alter that .
poirot had looked up at the staircase in passing , and shook his head in a dissatisfied manner .
she thought a minute .
think of the number of cretins there used to be , dependent for intellect on the sudden discovery of what thyroid glands , deficient or in excess , could do to you .
its as though i was thinking all these things in my mind , and sometimes they come out in the open and i say them to people .
cant see why and never have , but these chaps explain it very convincingly .
oh , said tuppence , that was painful .
on the left was a glass counter with toilet preparations .
sandra must make an effortit was absurd to appear so awkward , so gauche .
satterthwaite was silent for a minute or two .
only two people have an absolute alibi , sir george was on duty at the shows all afternoon , never left the front lawn , and the same goes for captain warborough .
not less than forty-eight hours and not more than seventy-two hours .
she struggled to regain command of herself .
he was not pleased when you insisted on questioning his wife .
poirot interposed a quick , deft question .
she paused a long time , and mr .
charles laughton , she pointed out , had too much avoirdupois , and so had francis l .
it was five and twenty minutes to twelve .
whats the other ?
she loved the man she killed .
the body was discovered this morning .
it can be that i am mistaken , he admitted .
take the wetherbysthey seem to have floated round the world , here , there and everywhere .
sophia moved away from me .
at the same moment the lock yielded to manipulation and the door swung open .
lady coote , clad in a resplendent purple dressing gown , cried out : the poor boy !
i used to come out with my head in a delirious whirland then i would get home and find a notice from the gas company threatening to cut us off if the outstanding account was not paid !
' i will investigate it for you with pleasure .
tuppences spirits revived to the normal .
she surveyed the floral decorations and approved , gave a few last orders to the butler , and remarked to her husband that so far nothing had gone wrong !
do you feel the same ?
most doctors do .
the valet was positive in his assurances that this was not the case .
argyle yes , yes calgary cut him short .
quin nodded and looked sympathetic , so much so that the other went on dreamily .
last man in the world !
the bacillus coli communis , for instance , the cause of ulcerative colitis .
just above the battery , as i showed you , there is a clearing in the trees where there used to be an old bench .
hes the only one of the family who i can see knocking out josephine quite callously if she knew something about himand shes quite likely to know .
but they could not have done so without leaving footprints in the flower bed .
if it had been just a harmless practical joke , the fingerprints wouldnt have been wiped off so carefully .
and the sleek m .
major laxton had died some years ago , so it might have been thought that harry would have had no ties to bring him backnevertheless it was to the home of his boyhood that harry brought his bride .
the sort of woman who was determined not to have her life blasted by one mistake .
the man , a young fellow , dug with ardour , his back to poirot who paused to observe him .
franklin and judith came up from the garden about a quarter to one .
he showed it to the second chap .
rycroft ; it is , as you say , an amazing occurrence .
ill tell youand this is a true storyabout a man who made good , said franklin rudge impressively .
there was a maze of tracks all over the surface .
well , since i cant leave with my car still in the ditch , thats fine with me , starkwedder exclaimed .
his breathing grew slow and even .
gerald read a few pages of his book .
real musicians had reserved judgment , realizing that the ear had to be specially trained and attuned before any criticism was possible .
ah well , theyre both dead now .
and gently , with his forefinger , he tapped the photograph of the child lily gamboll in the thick disfiguring spectacles .
ah , for gods sake dont croak , i said .
he went to the door and two men entered .
or even anyone who called on business .
mixing yourself up in something thats no concern of yours .
it was an enchanting evening with a smell of night-scented stocks in the air .
why has this whole place been allowed to get into the state its in ?
we did eventually get to banbury , after changing a wheel and trying to find a garage somewhere , but garages were few and far between in those days .
have you looked him up for me ?
you would not see it with the same eyeseven supposing that it should improbably have remained much the same .
he used this favourite phrase of his in a friendly and reassuring way .
if anyone wants to murder me , they can .
the vicarage had been one of the last places to hear the news .
theres no need to be so taken aback , she said .
the newcomer was a man of about thirty-five .
im going back to the post office .
he remembered looking at his watch just before the cry had come .
they have had , always , freedom from fear .
are you trying to say you think that it was meant in some way so that i should go on playing the fool with the cart and that the wheel would come off and the thing would fall to piecesoh , but that is nonsense , tommy .
yes , poirot sighed , i suppose there is not anywhere else to stay ?
sheila was a liar and probably always would be a liar .
poirots interested in the case , said spence with a grin .
very elated , i left the house , returned the keys to mrs .
but i must impress upon you that most of the things were working on nowadays are dangerous .
_num_ bus and proceeded to the savoy .
in each case the money was sent to one of those boarding houses or private hotels where there is no porter or hall attendant and where a large number of guests are always coming and going , including a fairly large preponderance of ex-service men .
the little maidservant opened the door .
pupils whose parents had found it either difficult or unwelcome to fetch them .
thered beoh do , do lets go on as we are now .
churston , i said , jumping to our own copy of an a b c .
it was neither beautiful nor ugly .
when you are young , you are young ; when you are in vigour you are a very strong man when your vigour begins to fail , you are old .
and this button from a wagon lit tunichow do you explain it ?
strange how clearly she could feel over all that distance , his excitement , the urgency of his mood .
that dated back for a long time .
he must , logically and necessarily , have had his dig at mr .
but there might be some deep psychological reason for his desiring his fathers death .
but it didnt seem like that at the time .
othello !
but didnt someone see who took it ?
shall i take a chair down to it for you ?
but then she had to invent a name quickly , and there it was that the unconscious association of ideas gave her away .
the three cases went back to the college .
tuppence sat quite still with a blank impassive face .
especially before breakfast , continued lord caterham , reverting to his principal grievance .
roberts were all psychological possibilities , though , as i have already mentioned , each of them would have committed the crime from an entirely different angle .
' carrington drew a deep breath .
we have to rely solely on deduction .
she opened her eyes again and smiled almost timidly at poirot .
i lowered her gently to the pavement and sat her with her back against the iron railings .
yesit made us look rather foolish .
were good friends .
all you will have to swear to is he is the man , harry castleton , to whom you were married .
yes , yes , yes !
it is true that they came by post , but there is a curious perfume impregnating themsomething in the nature of joss stickthat at once suggested the east to me .
make a copy of these letters and send the originals on to me .
you are a careful man , doctor .
welmans death inherited a vast fortune .
what about last night ?
i ordered a boxthe duplicate of one id been given and i had her initials put on it and an inscription inside .
but it showed no sign of life .
go on , mademoiselle , said poirot .
fiction is founded on fact .
a lizard suggests something quite tame .
i cannot but feel that m .
welli was born in octoberso it was lucky for me to wear opals , and because of that i wanted a real beauty .
he has a key of the back door , sir .
and what happened then ?
wanting things , scheming for them , lying , cheating , running up bills , promising to payoh !
oh , shes in here most evenings .
got round her husband , she did , and got him to say as he wouldnt prosecute if jackie paid the money back .
i would like to have your opinion on that , madame .
here is herr eberhard .
i can see you are the kind of man , quite unswayed by prejudice , who could really give a clear account of conditions there .
but there is much to be cleared away first .
monsieur , he declared , i have pleasure in restoring to you sir clauds formula !
dont go edging sideways towards that bell .
royde said emphatically : no , he wouldnt .
i forbid it .
there is a packet of arsenic in your larder .
with a jerk , he came back to the conversation round the table .
didnt you have enough crime out in mayang ?
miss marple smiled forgiveness .
leidner usually lay down every afternoon .
leger is a complication , he allowed .
it seems to me possible that to gain possession of them might be the motive of the crime .
if i had ever had any doubts , that would have settled it .
hell adjourn the inquestfor further evidence .
that , i suppose , was as good as i could expect .
it was agony to hercule poirot to watch her .
i hope you believe me , sir .
franklins just crazy about her .
emma isnt sure .
you know marlow ?
but how are you going to get away from tangier ?
its my opinion that he was speaking the truth when he said that it might have been one of two peopleand of those two people one was a servant and the other was a member of the family .
he already gives me a very handsome allowance .
it seems that mrs .
and womenmr .
over the tea table they gave joan west , raymonds wife , lou oxley her niece , and old miss marple , a rsum of the afternoons happenings , recounting in detail everything that miss greenshaw had said to them .
i learn my neighbours profession _num_ .
shes only been here a month .
its only young warrender , sir rowland assured him .
ithoughtrabbitnibbling the barkdont know how i came to make such a mistake .
celia interrupted her eagerly .
he stammers when hes nervous .
i sent for her a quarter of an hour ago .
suppose , hastings poirot murmured , just suppose that the thief did not suspect ?
yes , yes , i think youre right , because i remember coming downstairs with the police inspector and going into the common room with him and there were candles there .
is there any place where he could have hidden ?
had anyone helped her ?
but he has the qualifications .
most irregular indeed .
i cant imagine why she doesnt like me .
he is , i should judge , thirty-eight or nine , too young for frederick , too old for william .
he hadnt no call to go doing himself in as far as i can seeoh !
forty-three the augean stables the augean stables was first published in the strand , march _num_ .
its you , superintendent ; whats happened ?
it was a will made many years ago .
me , i answer , with profound and deep truth , nothing .
but madame is not like that .
she was already in charge of passports , tickets , money , etc .
i want to talk to him about car parking .
i should have said i had evidence of survival .
i liked the country when it was the countrynot all this motoring and jazz and that blasted , eternal radio .
your will has to assent to your desire .
she motioned to inspector kelsey .
everything had been quite as usual .
the notes are c , d , e , f , g , a , b , c .
you have heard , no doubt , of the young hungarian party .
elementary , my dear watsonthe smell of onions is unmistakable .
various witnesses testified to the accuracy of these statements .
under his scrutiny the frenchwoman got slightly restive .
edward was staring at her in perplexity .
and like an avenging fury , too .
whats beatrice ?
mary sounded preoccupied .
the door opened and race came in .
i dont give absolutionbut i listen to confessionsi dont you listen to him , interrupted estcourt .
oh well , i suppose im under suspicion , anyway .
you returned to the office about _num_ oclock and dictated half a dozen letters .
the old lady looked at her vaguely .
tossing its head , stamping its foot , slowly lowering its head with the great horns .
i followed her and found myself in a small , neat kitchen .
and so patrick and julia would plan to murder me ?
short of being described as rothschild , i dont mind , said jimmy .
on henrietta it looked very nice .
no right ?
' ' yes , but m .
she fixed her eyes absently on some newsboards .
you have no longer the curiosity , my friend .
i want lord caterham .
no , so far as my knowledge went , there was nothing to justify the writing of such a letter .
oh well , thought renisenb , why not ?
describe this lady .
killed that child ?
randall and sonia never had got on very well .
what gives them that urge ?
she had been a taxi dancerand a bright girl with plenty of men friends !
he said : do you mean you want me to be a kind of amateur sleuth ?
wed had a bit of a dispute with the white swan laundry if i remember rightly .
he does everythingand thinks of everything .
yes , said hercule poirot .
go to your room !
so we started off and the rain came on .
he can only move about in a wheeled chair .
well , they are very luxuriant still , i said .
' here i scream , ' said poirot helpfully .
that was the strength of his position .
its a lovely evening .
not everything , but some things .
norton kane .
she gave a terrified cry , then snatching up a heavy paper-weight from the desk beside her , she flung it at him .
i have read that name lately , very lately .
mary , mary gerrard !
she knew more about them all than anyone else could know .
pippa ran to the easy chair , snatched up her satchel , and turned again towards the hall door .
there could be no delight in life for a greedy girl like tea at rumpelmayers .
michael chavasse , _num_ harley street , will confirm that my life could only have been prolonged for a few months .
it wasnt pennington .
it was someone called mary jordan i was asking about , said tuppence .
im a bad lot , miss lessing .
betty went the other day .
the commissary leant forward excitedly .
a very faint smile crept over poirots bluish-tinged lips .
it was just a house .
got to meet a fellow .
it is certainly a little surprising , said poirot mildly .
then with a shock all lesser matters passed from his mind , and he stared with all his eyes .
and yet i knew that i was right about her fundamentally .
its ridiculous , cried eve .
philip lombards face changedsobered .
i sat there , a horrible cold sort of feeling stealing over me .
im frightfully sorry about that , but really listen .
family businessor used to bebut you cant call it that now .
a kafir boy was sitting by the hall door .
im old because i remember things that same way .
beatrice hesitated .
daily happenings , the house , sophia what about associated catering ?
but i cant seriously suspect george of murder .
inglethorps reason for not returning last night was , i believe , that he had forgotten the latchkey .
wychwood is a pretty healthy place .
well , id have thought it more likely hed just have shot the general .
chief-inspector davy got up .
the four bridge players stared after her .
youd be much more accessible .
people arent always what they think themselves to be , inspector neele pointed out .
theres a clearing higher up in the woods where you get a really good view .
it was pitch dark , but lawrence was following with the candle , and by its feeble light we saw that the bed had not been slept in , and that there was no sign of the room having been occupied .
in the middle of this riot of bird and vegetable life , rhoda perceived a battered kitchen table with a typewriter on it , masses of typescript littered all over the floor and mrs .
and father likes him , thats the main thing .
in _num_ when the great cult of the seaside for holidays was finally established and the coast of devon and cornwall was no longer thought too hot in the summer , arthur angmering found his vast inconvenient late georgian house unsaleable , but he got a good price for the odd bit of property acquired by the seafaring captain roger .
with a swift gesture she slipped off her chair and knelt before him with an abandonment that was wholly french .
in case she was going to hold any conversations with golden youth she had better read up a little on that also .
all will be well .
abernethie shook her head sadly .
not a thingand thats the odd part of it !
a curious remark that .
i knew , poirot continued , that someone had taken that box down recently .
i mean , do you think she might have confided in any of them ?
' so you see , m .
id say offhand that dr .
that is right , monsieur , _num_ boulevarddes capucines .
yes , yes , i know .
he thought : i wouldnt like to trust her near audrey if she had a knife in her hand .
i mustnt keep you from your cooking any longer , he said , since your niece is not home yet mrs .
lets get back again toto to your plan ?
i dont mean someone who knows about anonymous letters or even about murder .
having finished his toilet , he wrapped himself up in a thick overcoat and wound a muffler round his neck .
id like to take you to london and outfit you from tip to toe .
she passed through about a minute ago , said the other .
she was sadly out of breath .
no , said calgary , you would have given him your own if youd had any .
because of something she said .
he did go home , and got shot .
but he is a devil , that man .
i dont even know what part of canada she went to , continued mr .
thank goodness , im through with it now .
rustington all helped in the search .
trust julia to get a name wrong .
the evidence is bound to be inconclusive .
one must keep that out of it !
you picked up the gunpick it up i dont want to !
there was a join all round it .
we all three got up to get off and mr sanders lost his balance and fell right against his wife , sending her headfirst down the stairs .
it didnt occur to her , naturally , that i wouldnt know about all those things .
he waited to see if she would give him any lead , but she did not .
i should like to go .
it was a small dingy bookshop in a side street not far from the british museum .
a larger car was not suitable for desert travel .
the other fired point-blank at her as a joke , he said .
as i told you when you came to see me , she asked me to go up and telephone .
in one sense , i was justified , continued mr .
trust the instinct of madame !
and youre not likely to get the evidence you want ?
the commander looked a little surprised .
we have now , said poirot , only to find the scarlet kimono .
miss otterbourne was leaning over the side .
the charm of egypt had laid hold of me .
oh , nice !
he walked farther along the passage and came to a staircase .
on october seventha parish priest of the name of father gorman was murdered in west street , paddington .
for the sixtieth time that morning james rehearsed his wrongs .
his voice was triumphant .
said jane absently , as she twisted her head over her shoulder .
the girl who served him not molly .
if stephen or alexandra farraday had been concerned in the death of rosemary barton or in that of george barton no pull or influence would enable them to escape the consequences .
there was a coffee pot on the trivet and joanna made herself coffee whilst i helped myself to a whisky and soda .
now , i suppose , you will tell our wonderful madame olivier about me , and hunt me from paris ?
i knew that before i came here , but ive tested you to make sure .
that is curious , murmured poirot thoughtfully .
she said in a quavering voice : i didnt want mother to worry .
that is so , said miss neumann .
i havent quite thought it out .
unsuspecting girl , the villain from london , the stern father , the betrayalwe only need the faithful village lover .
poirot , is going to be the great force in government in ten years time .
his eyes looked very green in firelight .
we turned over the papers on the desk ; we hunted through the safe ; but at last we had to make up our minds to it that the papers were gone and gone within the short space of about three minutes while fitzroy was absent from the room .
the inspector looked thoughtful .
she was a nice , harmless child , and shed just got engaged to be married , and .
the interior was charming .
i feel sure that at that moment poirot and i had the same conviction .
oh , no , its not too strong .
a gossiping old man , i am afraid .
toujours pratique , the good hastings !
satterthwaite stared at him in surprise .
look here , harold , when you say trying to paint mr .
they say not .
some days before he had had the same kind of trouble .
i sometimes suspected it .
you did suspect her , i know it .
when we knock off , well take it roundand then i sees something written across the top of the page .
(parenthetically , inspector neele said to himself that he must look into that question .
kenneth marshall said : look here , arlena .
how say you , my friend , will you accompany me to fernly ?
fox , said margaret .
i listened to sir reuben , but i dont know anything about the subject .
ive got the face for it .
youmiss simmonswhere have you been all day ?
thats no reason for throwing yourself down in front of a jaguar .
' you ' re in luck today - turkey stuffe , with chestnuts - that ' s your favourite , isn ' t it ?
eversleigh .
stephen slashed absent-mindedly at the hedge .
the doctor rubbed his nose .
ah well , youre a righteous woman , jane marple , and right must prevail .
whats the real reason of having the room boarded up inside ?
, which narrows the field still farther .
he heard the sound of voices and saw lights moving near the trampled and broken hydrangeas .
but he was such a nice boynot good-looking , reddish hair , but a delightful smile .
the spirit did her good .
ah well , ill be careful you dont get foxglove and spinach planted together .
jim fanthorp grinned .
im sure you must understand what im feeling like .
hes working it out nowhis wife supplies the money for it , of course .
joanna asked what i was laughing at and i told her .
just as she was ready to cry with vexation the hooked safety pin caught in the key and she was able to draw it within reach of her fingers and then to pull it through the muddy trough to her side of the door .
by _num_ it looked precisely as it had looked in _num_ dignified , unostentatious , and quietly expensive .
it was after we had left the gare de lyon i came along to make the beds , thinking that madame would be at dinner , but she had a dinner basket in her compartment .
down by the river .
cried poirot with the air of one who has made a discovery .
victoria picked up her notebook and pencil and sailed into mr .
the novel writer ?
she said to herself restlessly : why shouldnt i be happy ?
that gentleman nodded his dark melancholic head .
if so , he had known her , he said , in india .
it would be better , would it not , if the stranger were to be a negligible personality , engaged in some harmless sport like fishing .
giles said , andand had he ?
i know what someone is trying to do to me .
oh yes , i remember , delicious it sounded .
the vicar murmured a long latin quotation about , i think , the evil power of witches , to which we all listened in respectful and uncomprehending silence .
an accident it was , sir .
before her , very clearly , there rose up the image of kamenis smiling face as he had sat facing her that day in the boat .
aristides nodded his elderly , tortoise-like head .
nice mind youve got , poirot , i must say .
i remember your saying that that was important .
ferrier said : it will prove , i fear , too herculean a task for us .
i suppose i must have had the bracelet in my hand and put it into the pocket of my suit without thinking , although i only found it this morning .
you say you were in the tea tent from four oclock on .
poirot saw no sign of mrs .
once again time seemed infinite .
you know , not hushing up things any more .
then there is dear peverell .
perhaps , elvira , you and colonel luscombe would like to have a little gossip .
very fortunately i happened to have them two good cases in the basement .
marshall cast a sharp glance at him .
i wanted to know , you see , just what was behind it all .
her best ones that she goes out in .
i take it , said mr .
practically all the hills in devonshire are the right shape .
i walked up from the station .
he waited hopefully .
i expect it may be in one of the drawers of the tallboys .
an american play , is it not ?
three hours was more than enough for mr .
i am helping him with the case , she explained .
but why moira stamped her foot .
finally he lays down the receiver , after a brief at once , my lord .
oliver promptly .
he would call me when he had got the bath sufficiently under control for me to enjoy it .
was it a happy atmosphere in the house ?
never minded contradicting people flatly .
but certainly , lady angkatell .
hm , said frankie .
he looked embarrassed .
i am excited in a way .
though it is not quite as you think .
whats that ?
what ive got to tell you is just this .
the kind of man he ismr .
well , i consider that in a mild way dorothea preston-grey suffered from a form of mental disorder that was dangerous and that she could only be considered safe if she lived under supervision .
he went in and she followed him .
did you suspect that she might be an impostor ?
information , it might be , that they did not even know they possessed .
one got busyinterestedtangled up with people .
he got it .
expense no object .
so you do ?
his eyes go so , from side to side , he walks softly and listens at doors .
i should be very glad for you to have it , if so .
captain trevelyan , as has been said , was a man of substance .
the plot develops .
he has a little money of his own , but hes not strong and has to live at home .
yes , sarah thought , desmond had got knock knees , she had never noticed it before .
mrs lacey dimpled up at him .
' ' there ' s certainly nothing i don ' t know about the practical side .
he seemed quite shocked at the suggestion .
she was a great talker .
ohyeswellhe was clarissa began hesitantly .
when she had been ushered out , he ran over her statement in his mind .
in another minute the door opens and the light is switched on .
sir george affected a careless hearty english gentleman mannerbut his bright blue eyes held the same watchful look as his wifes .
i mean , any man might want to write a book , but the bit about coming down here and passing myself off as a cousini suppose that made you smell a rat ?
they may have meant it just as awell , just as a piece of anarchy or smashing something or someoneanyone in fact .
you are hopelessly outnumbered .
according to her own statement , miss pebmarsh went out again about half past one .
she sat like that for a long time .
pointz idiosyncrasy was well known in the trade .
the wooden latticework that screened it was in the final stages of decrepitude .
what is a realtor , by the way ?
but its not going to be easy to prove .
looking at him , one would have been prepared to swear that innumerable ancestors of his must have perished by the guillotine in the french revolution .
neither of those two men cared in the least for valentine chantry .
a few minutes after i had returned to armstrongs room i left it , this time making a certain amount of noise so that someone should hear me .
with quick professional skill he peered down the old ladys throat .
nigel has always been profoundly unsatisfactory in his character .
it was not a nice picture .
i dont know what particular kind of offence that wasthe superindendent can tell me , i daresay , and run me in for so many months hard if necessary .
simon shook his head .
gobys double-jointed thumb , hundreds of patient questioning plodding men and women , old and young , of all apparent stations in life , were despatched to question , and probe , and achieve results .
a curious-looking engine of destruction i thought it at the time , and rather a humorous present to get from a strictly teetotal aunt .
fifteen , sixteen , maids in the kitchen i the interview with agnes fletcher took place in hertford , in a somewhat derelict teashop , for agnes had been anxious not to tell her story under miss morleys critical eye .
oh , said tuppence , slightly embarrassed .
poirot and i behaved in the customary fashion of people being shown over houses .
his eyes , perplexed eyes , went to the gap in the bushes and the view of the window .
probably you are , said mr .
queried sir james , looking across at the american .
at holyhead i tried to get into a carriage with people that looked all right , but in a queer way there seemed always to be a crowd round me shoving and pushing me just the way i didnt want to go .
theres a queer feeling in that house .
she raised her big inquiring eyes .
several things suddenly came together .
it was now seven oclock .
and if miss chevenix-gore (or , incidentally , mr .
and she narrated her encounter with sir james peel edgerton .
but there is nothing one can do to stimulate her .
tuppence had an idea that mr .
weve made great sacrifices for you to have a good education , they say .
she gave a little whinney of laughter , putting her head slightly on one side .
exactly as i suspected .
itll be adjourned , of course .
i loved him !
so it was to you she was telephoning ?
you know , im dead scared of that man .
ive never met anyone so detached from life .
said sergeant fletcher , with intense feeling .
i did not agree with that theory .
your husband had always been a devoted egyptologist , hadnt he ?
she seemed unnaturally calm , unnaturally ready with her recital of facts .
naturally its upsetting .
the dog stood at the top of the stairs , his ball in his mouth , his tail gently wagging .
he dined with them , went to the opera and they went on to supper at sobranis .
got some old-fashioned roses heresee this one , striped red and white .
only place in london you can still get muffins .
he came in here and went over to the desk and i went back to the kitchen .
ers .
i was full of curiosity .
and yet , if you studied the girls face , you saw that there was strength of purpose in the small , resolute jaw and the lips that closed together so firmly .
sandra had the impression that she didnt like rosemary .
he killed sir james with one blow , and he and she together did what they had to do he looked at mr .
in an hour , at monseigneurs .
speak for yourself , said mrs .
it is amazing how little the average person cares for pottery .
please go on with your story .
after all , to fake an alibi .
they knew that few girls had any money to throw about .
the girl went out again and mrs .
very good , approved mr .
what more crazy , stupid things can you say !
jarrow had not wanted this second child .
oh , your face !
when victor met ruth lessing , this particular story started .
strange had gone .
what an awful woman !
quite good cake , but very nasty buns .
mr gale was fast losing his practice .
left hereand then right , and then left again until you see the river and go towards it , and then sharp right and straight on .
well , of course the hill is still there .
of late years i make so many mistakes .
he complains of the taste of the stuffand coniine has a nasty taste .
he mentioned certain places , war experiences , people david shrugged his shoulders .
i hit him on the jaw .
anthony marston , in the height of his youth and manhood , had seemed like a being who was immortal .
you rushed into his cabin , got hold of it , listened outside dr .
she shook her head vigorously .
how do you know the murderer is of the first class ?
was miss vansittart absent today ?
margharita never gets much of a show from her own sexa darned sight too attractive .
do these things cause you no disquietude ?
she thought : he was in love with kayreally in love with herand then nevile came and took her away .
i took another week , while my leg healed , and then i too departed , first to italy and then to rome , i could not stay there as long as i had planned , because i had to catch my boat for beirut .
but with that line of defence mr petherick was not entirely satisfied .
oh , sir , you dont think theres anything could really have happened to him ?
aboutoh , i suppose a monthperhaps longer .
but yes , by all means , i was about to propose such an arrangement myself .
absolute weaklings .
theyll all be here .
of course its true that she wasnt a cultured woman at all , and as captain marshall isnt here i dont mind saying that she always did seem to me kind of dumb .
even the present tragedy could not dim the vitality of her personality .
amyas crale was an old friendhis family and mine had been friends for generations , but one has to admit that his conduct was , frankly , outrageous .
luck is the one thing that counts , said luke .
i was very upset by this .
yes , isabel ?
lucy demanded incredulously .
a telegram , cara , just came over the telephone .
unfortunately there is less and less market for stories of that size , and the authors tend not to be particularly well paid .
we got up to plenty of mischief together and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly all through those winter months .
a cold hand seemed to close round her heart .
weve heard of you , sir .
i had some faint idea in my mind that just a little specialized knowledge would have been needed .
whoever the boy or young man was , there is always the hope of eventual adjustment to a belief and acceptance that it is a duty to consider others , to be taught to feel an abhorrence if you have taken life unawares , simply out of what may be described as criminal carelessness that was not really criminal in intent ?
) alex walked slowly up the drive , turning over in his mind the possibilities of his new idea .
you see , linnets been all strung upexpecting jackie to turn up anywhere and everywhere .
then why not regard the incident as closed ?
it was so absorbing that time passed quickly .
every time we did so we found that something had been done wrong .
poirot shook his head as he answered : she has brains , you know .
no sort of consideration for anyones feelings .
in a few minutes he returned .
he reached whitehall a comfortable seven minutes late .
one of my books .
that was not specially noticed ?
mademoiselle , in the event of lady clarkes death , would you have married sir carmichael if he had asked you ?
there was always something wrong to me about edgar lawson .
but shes not really a good liarnot nearly as good a liar as you are , for instance my method will be to guess .
i simply cant understand it .
he had already made up his mind that harold crackenthorpe was not going to be helpful .
he had returned straight to his seat and had never been near the rear end of the car .
what made you ?
the way out here is for you to have left your employment this afternoon .
and then that clock chimed and just as it finished , the lights went out , the door was flung open and a masked figure said , stick em up , guys , or something like that .
her heart beat sickeningly in great pounding thumps , sounding right up in her ears .
jimmy caught her by the shoulder .
henry , of course , she said , is not at home .
it was running pretty fast , and i was nearly drowned .
harold said rather diffidently : is it to do withyour husband ?
and there are plenty of other possibilities .
you never saw anyone tampering with anything in your masters cabin on board ship , i suppose ?
i supposewell , i suppose its all right ?
though i doubt if its the kind of place to suit you , sir .
that garden , with its similarity of pebbles , struck the thief , whoever he or she was , as an ideal hiding place .
if anyone had placed a ladder against it , we ought to find traces of their passage .
_num_ : _num_ (or a minute or two earlier)colonel protheroe arrives at vicarage .
that one expects .
no offence , im sure , but hearing my name , as i thoughtwell , naturally if you think someones talking about you , its only human nature to listen .
thats very nice of you , len .
oh , many other things .
paris-stamboul .
it is naturalvery natural .
cosden drew a deep breath .
chapter two miss lemons sister , whose name was mrs .
there was then the polka , which was danced by all once they had graduated from thump , thump , thumpthe older girls in the class dancing with the younger ones .
we drove off to dover and from thence crossed the channel to the first stopping-place of our honeymoon , venice .
my heart beat sickeningly .
he broke off as mr .
we are still presented with a choice there .
almost by main force , norton hauled me back and round the corner .
but once he knew , well , what else could he do but break the engagement ?
their directness and vigour appealed to him , though their occasional solecisms made him shudder .
he was as good as his word .
there you are , miss , she said briskly .
im always lucky .
rosamund laughed .
argyle have felt about divorce ?
parker pyne arrived at his office on thursday morning to find mrs .
she had been waiting with her mistresss wraps .
you horrible vampirestealing my husband from me .
i always admired miltons satan .
here and now i had been shown sophias side of it .
it was the same in the last warhairdressers , waiters tommy , leaning back , catching the profile of appledore as the latter hovered deft-footed , thoughtwaiters ?
kennedy ?
a contradiction in terms .
we are civilized nowadays .
its the life ive been looking forward to for years , but ill admit to you , mr .
why did she need it so badly ?
weston said incredulously : are you suggesting that miss darnleys mixed up in this ?
most always .
with order and method in the mind one does not forget .
you have just told us how fond you were of mrs .
the others are the bishop of cromer and mr .
that is one of the things that i have learnt , that life has taught me .
in the seat behind her was a tall , thin man of about thirty with a highly technical vocabulary , clearly an architect .
money to her was a toy tossed into ones lap to play with .
it had a small race meeting twice a year which only the most obscure horses attended .
and now all this happens .
he clung to the theory of a fit .
she was on his side , she wanted to livethough god knew why , considering the slum she lived in , with a husband who drank and a brood of unruly children , and she herself obliged to work day in day out , scrubbing endless floors of endless offices .
stillingfleets red head , neighbourly recognition for claudia to whom she vouchsafed a slight nod , and finally dawning sympathy for andrew restarick .
oh , youre here , monsieur poirot , the secretary observed .
she looked at him in a way that hercule poirot fully appreciated .
you have no doubts ?
i thought it best to have lunch served immediately in the restaurant car , he said .
you know inglethorp said he had put down the coffee in the hall ?
inspector narracott came to his rescue .
about you , i mean .
he had a nice tutor , a young man called , i think , mr shaw , about whom marguerite lucy commented , a nice little natureits a pity his legs are so common .
bleibner , whatever his intentions , had made no will .
not really very easy , but i hope that i can manage it .
it was likely therefore that when he discovered his mistake he would make another attempt to get hold of the memoirs .
yes , there is some point you want explained to you ?
youre quite right in some of your views about him .
the sunday comet said many things , but it did not say that .
victoria waved that query aside .
i assumed , as a matter of course , that the child would be like me .
to listen to you one would think nobody had ever been poisoned before .
but here we come to a curious point : she had the opportunity of substituting the blank paper , but no motive .
i have never approved of this garage project .
the belief that she had jewels round her neck worth fifty thousand pounds had made of dorothy pratt a new woman .
well , no , greta didnt come because , well ellie hesitated , cora , my stepmother , doesnt treat greta exactly like that .
she gave a deep sigh when i had finished , but she did not say at all what i had expected her to say .
oh yes , and there was a son .
it has been photographed and described in the papers .
bantry , who lived near st .
hobbs , the churchwardenand he was imitating his lordship up at the manor and the two under-gardeners laughing , when up came his lordship quiet-like and gave tommy the sack on the spotand naturally that was only to be expected , and quite right , and his lordship didnt bear malice afterwards , and helped tommy to get another job .
she looked amused .
i can assure you that everyone feels a deep sympathy with your position , miss trefusis .
a curious greyish pallor crept across his face .
and itll give us more time , too , pursued bridget .
it is all soso bewildering , m .
de sousa studied him for a moment or two in silence .
franklin had been calling for sal volatile , hot-water bottles , various patent food and drinks , and was unwilling to let nurse leave the room .
aspirin , boracic powder , iodine .
a perfect shot .
he had to shoot .
she thought , i wantbut what do i want ?
poirot at the mouthpiece .
you neednt be nervous , madam , said inspector neele , but its much better to come out with the truth .
she could do that , i expect .
jimmy clutched his head .
then he picked up the telephone .
so i put the necklace in the box .
had she not once said to hori that she must walk down this path alone at the hour of nofrets death ?
she had described how wise and inspiring every word had seemed , and how , afterwards , the remembered words in their actuality had seemed commonplace enough .
she displayed a great desire to see everything that was to be seen , and iwell , in short , i took the key to show her the body .
i shall be delighted to receive you .
what do the police think about it ?
the parasol was down , he could see the little haggard lines at the corners of her eyes .
he talked mostly to greta , giving her as it were the special benefit of his charm .
four of em there was , and their brotherbut he didnt get much of a look-in with all those women .
keeps his room , and cant get about much .
what with all the bottles , cachets , powders , capsules , and little boxes that they carry about with them ; what with popping in a tranquillizer here and a tonic there and a pep pill somewhere else , dont you think it would be easy enough that the whole thing might get mixed-up ?
i was down for saturday and sunday .
nadine did nothing .
i put her in clerks because it was warmer .
her conscience made her more effusive to gerda than she would have been normally to any guest .
and youre going up to london to have a good time ?
there is worse to come .
so you think now .
it was still ragingly hot .
poirot stared at me in surprise .
bit theatrical-looking , said cray , after reflecting a moment .
george didnt expect me .
whats the point ?
oliver looked as though she didnt agree with him .
excuse me , i said , but theres something perhaps i ought to mention .
what use is a greenhouse to us now ?
to confess .
i was lying on a kind of rough couch , also covered with skins , and my left arm was bandaged up and felt stiff and uncomfortable .
poirot saw him make his overtures , saw the remorseless way in which they were rebuffed .
there was also , however , the small and odoriferous man .
is it a poem ?
folly , cried ipy , loudly .
these things happen .
poirot gave an answering sigh .
i was thinking of ruth .
major waters thinks that his wife might have changed her name and that probably the child might be known by the name she had taken .
i didnt connect the two things at the time .
he withdrew and i was left to digest this morsel of information .
well , if satterthwaite takes on manders , ill take on miss wills .
james partridge .
admission of fraud .
it was a well-bred , assured voice , a charming voice , although perhaps a trifle arrogant .
without a word , dermot got up and left her .
all round joburg he must have innumerable spies and agents .
she couldnt remember four winds farm as well as she could remember the cuckoo clock and the tapestry room .
poirot turned his head very slowly and looked at the secretary .
but , he sez to me , ill get every penny of two thousand pounds for this house .
what , that fellow ?
darlingdont be absurd you know as well as i do .
mondays paper dealt appreciatively with the dead mans career .
max had another police cell , and urged me to invoke his assistance if needed during the night .
mrs hailsham-brown did mention his name .
i had some idea , i think , of nursing his son so badly that the son would die .
that is a question which , perhaps , owing to what has happened , we shall have to discuss .
and i walked with amyas .
forbes seemed slightly unwilling to proceed .
he was a doctor , he had opportunity and means , no doubt .
they looked at each other sympathetically .
i mean that i think some of these organizers and administrators here are well versed in hypnosis and psychology and that , without our being aware of it , we are continually being offered suggestions of our well-being , of our attaining our ultimate aim (whatever it is) , and that all this does produce a definite effect .
imhoteps face , anxious and careworn , lightened at the sight of his much-loved youngest son .
with a hoarse cry she clutched the child closer .
thats a dreadful thing to say .
a side issue , but one that i fancied might repay investigation .
and again i felt what an extraordinary and quite unconscious power of attraction he had .
it seemed to her less suspiciousbut it was a mistake .
about the garden , isnt it ?
when you had that interview with whittington , they had time before them .
i should never have thought of the little maid in the kitchen being connected with the case .
i genuinely want to recreate the past , to feel and see the events that took place , to see behind the obvious and to visualize the thoughts and feelings of the actors in the drama .
clotilde moved .
i dont think ive got anything to say to you .
bella wouldnt even wait to see how things went .
went off and never come back .
he tried to visualize a handsome young subaltern and a pretty girl in the moonlight .
no , i dont , said tommy .
or she may like the power that money gives .
miss arundell of littlegreen house .
you wont get her to impute bad motives to anybody .
who did you see standing at the door when you turned into the passage ?
her husbands people owned nasse originally .
far too many of them .
i dont know what you think about it , dr gerard , but i think that theres a limit to what a woman ought to put up with !
and that makes them , in an ordinary human , unprofessional word : nervy .
i walked all through the night and then i hid behind this hill in case you were an enemy .
she ought , she felt , to have been revolted .
so cold , so foggy , so disagreeable .
t : market cleve _num_ .
about a week ago , i got a box of chocolates sent through the post .
where did we put the albums and the big bound volumes of the art journal ?
apparently she is going to marryor that is the ideamrs .
one could not see the inside very well from the outside , on account of steam , so he pushed the door gently open and entered .
to go over the facts laboriously one by one .
i can truthfully say ive never been cruel to children or dogs .
when i heard of it , it was an accomplished fact .
theres not much she doesnt know , about what goes on in her school .
bland seemed in very good form .
i myself , said mrs .
i wonder why she wants to see you ?
by putting our heads together i feel we might get at something .
what is the logical inference to be drawn from that ?
well go to him first .
she joined the friendly witch and they went through the secret door and on down .
so , too , another memory .
she says she feels she asked maggie down here to her death .
just think of the hell of itnever to be able to chuck something , and say , oh , for the lords sake stop bothering me .
youve put it out of my head .
the little man was equal to the occasion .
then he said : wellnot exactly .
he had had considerable wealth as well , most of which had come to lucy , so that edward was a comparatively poor man , with enough to keep the place up , but not much over when that was done .
sir george sanderfield leant back in his armchair .
this ancient hercules probably suffered from grand mal .
one old maidthe sour kindhe knew them well enough .
nursie disapproved .
oh no , they dont , mrs .
oh no , the house is empty .
but i know thishe is a man to fear .
perhaps you wouldnt mind giving me her address .
she might have got hold of some queer native stuff that way .
clearly only recent illness was accepted by mrs .
tears came into mrs .
and harlequin is only a myth , an invisible presence .
however , all these incidents have been very small fryfivers and tennersthat class .
you want , said mr .
poirot looked at hastings for a moment , as though giving his friend a chance to consider the question .
lets have the facts , mr .
ii dont know , i said , momentarily confused .
satterthwaite , making the same answer he had made to elizabeth .
respectable pair and knew their job .
when meadowbank was established , safely established , as a great english institution .
colonel easterbrook turned him over , felt the pulse , the heart then drew away his fingers with an exclamation of distaste , looking down on them .
well snap out of this , never you fear .
where was everybody when this happened ?
he did not answerwas indeed saved from answering , for at that moment gerard touched his shoulder and said : look .
perhaps , monsieur waverly , you will be so kind as to continue .
you have an excellent cook .
they had quarrelled and parted after about a year .
it is , perhaps , the digestion .
no bloodstains , no weaponnothing to get rid of or conceal !
it was worth while doing the thing thoroughly .
and what did he say ?
andi suppose he knew too much .
not quite so simple as you think .
we know some of the places she used to go when she left here .
here , he remembered , he had started with a little group of people in a boat .
just a chance remark of doyles .
poirot said that he believed that that was so .
continue , continue .
theres something incongruous about james pearson hitting an old man on the head with a sandbagbut in a manner of speaking it might be all in the days work to brian pearson .
si , si , that is what you do , all of you .
whereabouts ?
but if you really read a case carefully its amazing the way they track down murderers with practically no evidence to go on .
there was , alas , no sign of the full rich bosom that i had hoped for when i was at cauterets .
he went past very quickly and turned off by the path to the right , which is a short cut to the terrace .
think of the wild days of peril we went through once .
i must impress upon you , mr .
definitely not a nice girl , said race .
can you repeat those actions ?
they moved to the door .
to keep a house full of antique clocks in working order was not easy .
lucia turned to face him again , flinging her head back in a gesture of defiance .
he looked at sir rowland , apparently taking note of the fact that he had moved .
thats what i heard .
very confusing , isnt it ?
given certain circumstances , it wouldnt be so much of a coincidence .
agatha christie marple miss marple the body in the library .
you would like to kill so and so .
ascher _num_ .
for in between meals he spent quite a lot of time searching out and marking down possible sources of new and delicious food .
careless youths said to their partners : old satterthwaite ?
this island depressed himwhy , oh !
then , imperceptibly , i found my arguments changing .
also available by charles osborne the life and crimes of agatha christie agatha christie was the author of over _num_ plays , short story collections and novels which have been translated into _num_ languages ; she is outsold only by the bible and shakespeare .
but i didnt mean you to make a stand to the death about it _num_ or _num_ would have done us equally well .
besides , said mrs .
yes , yes , renisenbsurely .
you dont drop in to a place when youre living six miles away .
if i could answer those , i should feel happier in my mind .
here is a possibility of something interesting .
it is a matter of great delicacy , said the older man dropping his voice confidentially .
and so n , securely settled in his appointed place , with sea communications and his secret wireless and his staff officers at sans souci close at hand , is ready to carry out germanys plan .
youve been very very kind to me .
vii you are amelia mary sedley and you reside ordinarily at _num_ charles street , boonamba , auckland ?
as it is , i must postpone getting my autograph book until after dinner .
polperro , said miss gilchrist proudly .
she smiled now at miss marple , and miss marple felt reassured .
pooh , said mrs .
and how did she get the stuff into georges champagne glass ?
when he gets back , tell him weve had a positive result .
do anything you like with it , he says .
it was willard , thin , pale , spectacled and dyspeptic , who had dragged his adoring mother on this tour through greece .
wasnt any welfare in those days .
i stabbed him , right enoughyou may be quite sure of that .
messieurs , mesdames , i have called you together for a certain purpose .
that he had been , not in the drawing room , but in the library .
just carry up my despatch case , will you , dear ?
found nothing of interest except in the bathroom .
she is easily imposed upon , over docile , completely open to suggestion .
etherington died , apparently of food poisoning .
then , a year or so later , i lost my heart again , when acting in a musical play got up by friends in torquaya version of bluebeard , with topical words , written by themselves .
one son would have been quite enough .
xi superintendent battle looked round the bedroom .
i knew that he was pompous and petty and completely self-absorbed , but i knew , too , that he was a kindly person and almost absurdly tenderhearted .
oh , quite .
anxiety took over .
i should like to have seen it .
yes , sir , very poorly she was .
her breathing grew more regular though it was still far from normal .
said dashwood .
i dont know why i was so sure .
he didnt do anythinghe didnt even hold out any hope .
once you have got into that state of mind where the taking of human lives no longer counts , then if it is simpler to put a little explosive package under a seat in a plane than to wait about at the corner on a dark night and stick a knife into someone , then the package will be left and the fact that six other people will die also is not even considered .
mary ann , he said thoughtfully .
no , i did not drop it .
i am not keeping back facts .
her breath was coming rather unevenly and her eyes were nervous .
what did she say about louise ?
theyd have told a much better story than that if theyd wanted to be believed .
do you know what i was thinking this afternoonthat if there were to be one more crime wed surely know .
weve had our eye on them ever since prince michael landed in england .
perhaps he had a whole repertoire of murder stories .
and she remembers nothing , said sir james slowly .
all very well to say that he was a specialist interested in unsuspected heart conditions such as mr .
ive forgotten it now , but you infect a rabbit with blood from a person with yellow atrophy of the liver , and then you inject that rabbits blood into another rabbit , and then that second rabbits blood into a person and the person gets a diseased liver .
mcnaughton , spade in hand , came round the corner of the house .
she liked the vicar .
you know the course .
sir james hesitated a moment , then he replied : yes .
you are very sure of his guilt ?
i approve of it from start to finish .
thats just what it is .
and even now the faithful badger uttered no word of reproach .
you see !
theres nothing to be done , i said .
but were they once ?
bland remarked that she liked living in crowdean because she had a sister here .
trefusisin confidence .
' give me a line on those two young women - mrs allen and miss plendedeith .
i simply had to see you again soon .
that is the other side of the village .
it was , then , a distinct possibility that the murder was committed during this particular hand and i determined to find out , if i could , exactly how the bidding had gone .
i knew my duty and i took it to the police , though of course it wasnt exactly pleasant for me , was it ?
well , you could write another book .
yes , ive got to try .
there is an excellent train service and it is far quicker than going by car .
an expedition was then made out of the town of st .
was she there when de sousa arrived ?
on the point of following her , she whirled back again .
also two pieces of dry bread .
thank you , she said again .
kay said shortly : i did .
i dont really feel that ive got sufficient experience to judge .
how have i inspired you this time ?
the nurse followed him .
im sure you agree .
i dont think he was really a nice man , said mrs .
bishop in person , rustling in her old-fashioned black , and weeping unashamedly .
it is a mental home .
well , its the other way round with him .
its quite a mania with him .
but not confused , do you think ?
it had comeat last .
but i dont get drunk , terry , and yet im out of work .
philip blake said fretfully : what is all this ?
it was a pretty busy afternoon , a lot of people leaving flowers and coming to see patients .
miss arundell knew what theyd come for !
his eyes almost started out of his head .
now why did he have that feeling ?
it had been a genuine accident and olive betterton had been genuinely on board the plane .
he had never conceived of miss scheele as having any family or relations .
does that fit in , m .
at that same moment , dr .
the other one affected a more spanish appearance with sideburns .
our firm , of course , has known many generations of the crales .
its a sleeping draught , thats all .
soundssurely pistol shots .
leonides gave you this letter and then you left him ?
oh yes , i think i met them both .
careless thing to do , said sir charles cheerfully .
one thing at a timelet us be methodical .
we were ushered into a little sitting room arranged with formal precision , and there , after a lapse of a minute or so , my friend of yesterday came to us .
cardiac weakness .
he asked curiously : what did she say to you ?
all right , then , here it comes .
constable jones replaced it on a table and resumed his seat and his note-taking .
gay rugs , well-polished furniture , and many knickknacks , had quite transformed the gloomy aspect of no .
you exaggerate .
yes , that is the weak pointin which direction are you to be careful ?
the au pair girl ?
whats the matterhas she gone off with someone or playing up ?
then you are really going to let me have the picture ?
i heard , said sister anderson .
you learn to take a pride in not turning a hair when some shocking tragedy occurs ?
i think , being monty , he enjoyed himself to the end .
that revolver must be found .
mary told him of the tragic sequel to the evening .
since we could not see them from our houseor only the very high rocketswe usually spent the evening with some friends who lived just over the harbour .
hilary said with sudden emotion : you want me to betray someone who is dying ?
the conductor became brisk and businesslike .
you mustnt have these ideas .
but i really had to do something .
she bustled down the stairs .
i nearly forgot , said the girl suddenly .
the evidence of the american lady _num_ .
we lived in the hall , you know .
hasnt life taught you even now that you cant own other human beings body and soul ?
but upon my word , theyre not much to go upon .
elise entered .
simon , her husband , was quite brokenhearted .
cant get away from foreigners even here .
someone had noticed the habit bob had of leaving his ball at the top of the stairs .
two in the drawing room conversation had flagged more than once .
i thought perhaps it might bemrs .
she wore bifocal spectacles and had a hearing aid which she sometimes , but very seldom as far as tuppence could see , had to use .
oliver , said eve carpenter .
you do not think i ought to go to the police ?
its crazy , isnt it ?
people wish to interview her , to know what she thinks about such subjects as student unrest , socialism , girls clothing , should sex be permissive , and many other things that are no concern of hers .
it was then put by me in my overcoat pocket .
luke had stopped , and ellsworthy was nearly abreast of him when he at last looked up .
sir eustace looked surprised .
it is a lady from en gland for you .
meanwhile , the young man remained very strictly on his guard .
the chap is a nice young chap .
i used it as the setting for a short story called the house at shiraz .
the lawyer assented with a little bow .
it seems to have got stuck , somehow .
sit down , said miss percehouse .
he turned to miss glen .
you will ask for berth number nine .
she motioned hilary to a chair , opened a drawer beside her and took out a sheaf of forms upon which she commenced to write rapidly .
was it all violence and brutality , the kind of sordid murder or robbery which it was beneath his , poirots , dignity to investigate ?
so i dont suppose for a moment that major palgrave would recognize the face in the snapshot if he came across the man casually .
i couldnt get on to stavansson .
yes , practically desert .
she did so , and suddenly i heard her call and realized she was crying for help .
its not everyone who would have been so intelligent .
however , i rejected this course as being too risky , so i merely put on my best hat and went sadly down the village to interview our justly irate grocer .
oh , that , yes .
she was crazy about her little sister .
the letter arrived when i was seriously ill and to this day i am not certain whether i acknowledged it .
lots of people cant remember what they did and where they were even a week ago .
that is all i am at liberty to say .
raglan seems very sure of himself , but im not quite certain that i agree with him .
in the dining room , one of those silences that hurstall had described was proceeding .
hunter and his sister .
she had quite a pretty figure but her plain , waterproof cap was rather too serviceable to be attractive .
they have now their following not only in south america and europe .
because he wanted to miss him .
of course i know my own name , snapped victoria .
and she loved him stillthat was the mischief of it .
unknown to me , she made the acquaintance of this comte de la roche .
i have , on the contrary , refused to alter so much as a single word .
shes a very unusual woman .
all my aunts are mercifully dead .
aha , said tommy .
but curiously enough theyre not any more fantastic than the real thing .
i have often wondered whether he did marry any of those three , or whether he found a fourth who combined good looks , being a good listener and being gay as well .
revel , that that is not the only letter .
outside were sleeping quarters for the native servants , the guardhouse for the soldiers , and stables , etc .
shes a very nice lady , miss emma is , and ive not heard a word against her , not a word .
id rather tell you than have you snooping around finding out .
we checked up .
poirot rose , uttered excuses to the swedish lady and followed the man out of the dining car .
anyway , ive made it a rule to pull in my stomach and let my behind look after itself .
i know mademoiselle cynthia .
no , because i never did .
a hundred pounds , said bundle .
you are mrs .
now he looked at his watch .
no one is supposed to know about it .
he must still seem to be in need of the money .
' a pleasing little problem , obscure and charming , ' murmured poirot .
a nasty business !
bitterness and black rebellion broke over her .
her husband exclaimed as he caught sight of her .
leonides was very kind to me always and i had the greatestthe greatest respect for herbut nothing morenothing more , i do assure you .
his silence seemed to disquiet her .
that should have conveyed something to you .
i went over the facts carefully .
pennington was sufficiently perturbed to tell a rather stupid lie .
tusks .
the ship had left new york the previous week with almost two thousand passengers ( _num_ of them u .
youve got very queer tastes , i must say , matilda .
not when he was first down here .
how old would this brother and sister be ?
what are youa chief-inspector or this new thing they call a commander ?
instead of giving it to her , dr carelli glanced at caroline amory with an almost questioning look .
we are a company of six , three representatives of each sex , and i protest on behalf of the downtrodden males .
im afraidfor you !
' well , jameson , get anything ?
he spoke crisply .
the boy laughed scornfully .
she thought he started slightly when he saw her , but he greeted bill with respectful recognition .
he prefers to be on his own .
he then demanded to inspect winnies trunk which had , of course , arrived here with those of the other girls .
father went to two or three specialists .
the man was tall , dark and well dressed , with a drawling voice and a superior manner .
it isnt that sort of thing at all .
you know who i mean , though you dont agree .
no countesses and marchionesses and lords and ladies .
yes , i am proud of angela .
any amount of it , said anthony .
and even if we are rightwe have got to prove we are right .
battle nodded absently .
she had already seen stratford on avon , clovelly , exeter cathedral , torquay and , after visiting beauty spot here and historic dartmouth , i go to plymouth , discovery of new world from plymouth hoe .
one out of twenty .
' what about fingerprints , by the way ?
he stared at poirot with the utmost astonishment .
he took no notice of hamers approach .
or the mans ?
poirot said : the manager , he knows of course who you are ?
i grinned .
he got it at last .
one cannot escape from the facts .
babbington , that your husband didnt leave very much money ?
for answer she held out the paper to him , her finger pointing to the headline .
he was dismissed by the firm .
i delay your lunch hour .
she fetched a tray and took the things out to the kitchen .
unobtrusively she turned and again passed the two .
he produced a notebook and pencil .
was he what she wanted ?
tim kendal was standing in the doorway .
and supposing that thats the house that your missus has recognized somewhere , and has gone dashing off to investigate .
by the way , im leaving tomorrow , too .
redfern in the boat .
it was a graceful head , the modelling of the bones sharp and well-defined .
youve no money .
as a matter of fact i thought she was just making herself important .
the butler waited a moment , then inquired : is that all , sir ?
allerton sounded doubtful .
you want to rest .
my partner , said tuppence with dignity .
hercule poirot laid his hands on the cup .
but the upper middle classes are given no more leeway than the arrivistes .
but this was a grand , a super-party at the savoy .
he heard it , though , and come out to see .
again nofret repeated : he wishes me to stay here .
that is why i bought my little book and urged it on your attention .
oh , im so pleased .
you lunched with her yesterday .
indeed my sister was an entertaining person in every waywherever she went things happened to her .
he was a doctor and he may have tumbled to ellsworthys abnormal state .
so very kind of you to think of asking my wife to stay , lady frances .
it wasrather horrible .
and so we see history repeating itself .
he said hurriedly to pilar : where are you going ?
would they be content ?
here , however , his plans had gone awry .
you may , perhaps , know my name , began poirot .
or , perhapsby someone like mr .
as a matter of fact i made a short visit to the hospital at carristown , talking to the matron before going on to the church here .
had rosalie any motive ?
you are quite sure of your times ?
she wasnt very young .
she may have been thinking all along that he was concerned in it .
what could they do to her ?
she goes up to the house , fetches a bottle from the conservatory where it was kept and takes it down to him .
seventeen what a mysterious thing sleep is .
shes a madame grandier .
well , people do shoot themselves when theyre a bit barmy .
betting .
but the old man was very miserable about it , and moped , said he was no good for anything anymore , and leonard , who was very softhearted and rather foolish , began to pretend he drank more than he should .
id shoot john with one and then hide it , and let people find me holding the other , and first theyd think id shot him and then theyd find he couldnt have been killed with that revolver and so theyd say i hadnt done it after all !
there were two deaths from duelling in that room .
out of it he drew a delicate pencil drawing .
and then anything might happen !
hes come in place of dr .
cest insupportable !
of course , rowley said , one cant be sure just what she did hear .
id say he suspected infidelity , said horsham .
as we sipped it , sir montagu discoursed .
underneath , whispered audrey with a shudder .
really i could not say , said miss merrion aloofly .
you go and see one old lady with a birthday book .
ackroyd was very grateful to me .
the fellow behaved very well and gave her an adequate allowance .
thank you , mr cope .
i do think its so sweet of you to have me here , said madeleine to her hostess .
major mitchell said with a sigh : well , i suppose theres nothing to be done but arrest him ?
roared stonor .
damn it all , he didnt like those inverted commasmrs .
then here it is .
well then , perhaps youd better not .
kimble at her ease and all that .
magnificent , i believe .
how did you see it ?
presently he reappeared and with him came a young man with a very dark complexion , wearing an emerald green pullover .
come , leidner , you must eat .
do you know how old i am ?
one of his secretaries approached me .
just a minute , miss protheroe , said slack .
yes , yes mr .
that seems a kind of tower in the middle of the circle , but it would be very hard to identify .
' ' but you think it improbable ?
at one time he was going right down the hillpeople wouldnt have anything to do with him .
we found it well above the reach of any tide .
in the centre of the grove there should be a temple , he said .
gabler , said the young woman .
a rather tall young man with long flaxen hair and a budding beard seemed to be the principal attendant .
bill seized the telephone book , ran an unseeing eye down a column of ms , shut the book with a bang and moved to the instrument on the desk .
his psychology fits very well with the crime .
what did you find out about her ?
something to show that the names registered , that all was not well .
yet you read the papers as muchin fact , more than i do .
if one man does not make a move , the other must , and by permitting the adversary to make the attack one learns something about him .
you were looking at the cabaret , not noticing that portion of the restaurants furnishingsthe waiter !
if one was arranging proposals in order of merit , this one would easily go to the top of my list .
twenty-two miss marple tells her story when did you find out , asked professor wanstead , that those two women were private agents accompanying you for your protection ?
you live near here ?
there were some blunders made about that timecommanding officers sacrificed men unnecessarilypossibly this was a blunder of that kind .
it wasnt dated .
it was a bigger gentlemanhandsome-lookingcame in a big car .
now , i ask you , do i look as though i thought there were the least chance of your killing me ?
chapter _num_ nadine boynton came out of the hotel .
his first name , that is .
i always say theres nothing like a nice cup of teaa strong cup !
roddys eyebrows rose in surprise .
her heart was beating fast , and her eyes sought him in a kind of anguished appeal for reassurance .
and i thought perhapswell , hed mentioned the whole thing to you .
or the olive branch itself ?

here is the explanation of the victims inertia , he said quietly .
for a sick man he was looking lucy thought , remarkably cheerful .
he was a small gentleman , well dressed , very neat , very spotless , the moustache very stiff , the head of a peculiar shape , and the eyes green .
already it may be too late .
we are living now in more enlightened days , free from the old caste-prejudice .
but i assure you that you are over-conscientious .
i want a few words with you , mr .
oh , juliuswhat will the chauffeur think ?
the inn was a wonderful old place with a kind of porch in front built on four pillars .
that fellow giraud is an ill-conditioned brute , and id be delighted to see someone score at his expense .
a large hotelwith only one wing open at present .
i saw that it had .
as victoria had anticipated : mrs .
afterwards .
we girls had at last abandoned the high collars to our blouses , which were stiffened by little zigzag bones , one up each side and one at the back , so as to leave red , uncomfortable marks on the neck .
he kept saying lemme golemme go .
for bella had married a foreignerand not only a foreignerbut a greek .
she asked , staring at him .
we arrived at combeside (as the house was called) at about eight oclock .
very oddbut there it is !
satterthwaite speaking .
it was dreadful !
its very suspiciousbut weve got to go carefully .
should welcome cooperation , said captain maitland promptly .
such a marvellous line .
nor i , said poirot .
were you ever compelled to mutilate the animals in the way you specified ?
a kind of brownish colournatural wool .
i was kidnapped , said victoria breathlessly .
good morning , madam , said the young man .
but the dicks were too smart .
luckily no one caught me .
put in julius .
does she , now ?
not that it matters very much , said caroline , reading my expression correctly .
she moved slowly to the sofa , sat , and waited for a moment before speaking .
youll find the letter when you get back .
nine that evening poirot had only given susan cardwell a fleeting glance .
gasped mrs .
how easy !
oliver had supplied him with , feeling rather like a human computer .
you will find it is as i say .
a good-looking young frenchman came out of the bar and across the terrace , cast a swift discreet glance at hilary which , thinly disguised , meant : is there anything doing here , i wonder ?
he worked you like a niggerand who pocketed all the fat fees ?
what names your english towns have !
i couldnt have believed it .
and faintly from the distance : covent garden .
ive never forgotten anythingnot an action , not a name , not a face .
van aldin , that m .
that is has , in fact , succeeded !
there was admiral chandler , white haired , looking older than his years , his shoulders bowed as though by an overheavy burden , and his eyes dark and brooding .
hed made himself comfortable , david noted that .
if he does think that , said miss marple aloud , hes gaga .
ah , now , why ees eet you want to know ?
the telephone rang , typewriters clicked , the pressure of business was average , neither above nor below its usual volume .
i dont know how it is , miss savernake , but it seems to be trouble wherever i go , and im sure its not my fault .
with a grunt of disgust he picked up the topmost letter from the little pile on the side of his desk .
im the one who knows .
and no woman respects a man when hes doing a thing thoroughly badly .
no good her pretending shes your wife .
he takes up his headquarters in england , but intends to spend the summers in france .
jimmy agreed .
if sir george really wants those advertisements put in , i suppose id better see about it , she said .
what you say , there is no doctor ?
henry shuffled his feet , looked at her , shuffled his feet again , picked his nose and rubbed his left ear and then moved his feet in a kind of tattoo .
the kind of thing that i have never understood in the least .
you might put that theory forward if it werent for the letters .
easy enough .
especially since it would seem that the embalmers men are with us permanently .
without presuming to correct her geography , george said it was a splendid idea .
and it is not prettywhat i have to tell you .
well , the easiest , the most natural explanation would be that you had seen them before .
mr lennox boynton said at first he did not know what time he returned to the camp , but later he admitted having set his mothers wrist-watch to the right time .
the russian did not reply for a minute or two .
another possible source of blood in the courtyard .
i realized how closely every detail of our life must be known .
this really did surprise me .
then he smiled and said : but most of us are , i can tell you that .
i think she did , said miss marple .
naturally youve got to say what you can .
he was a big burly man of middle age with a shifty eye and a truculent jaw .
you regard the capitaine daniels , then , as above suspicion ?
theyve got to find a motive for this ridiculous accusation .
am i in it ?
could have told him that all along .
when things go wrong and youre caught in the slumpwell , the best thing to do is to put a good face on it and bluff .
causing you all this bother .
im sorry , madam , said the elderly mary , trembling with rage , after a couple of days , but its not right , the food were given .
he paused for a moment , and then straightened up with a cry of , weve got it !
thought she might have had a headache or something and was lying down .
brown , and how she had consented to discover and reveal to them the whereabouts of jane finn .
its the front door , mr .
she laughed happily and ran out of the room , going along towards the ballroom at the far end of the house .
i think hes wonderful , reallyquite wonderful .
poirot joined him .
cust drew himself up and said : do you know , a newspaper has actually offered me a hundred poundsa hundred poundsfor a brief account of my life and historyii really dont know what to do about it .
i dont know , hastings .
i had no money coming in now from anywhere except what i could make or had made myself .
i repeat it is an insult .
for the first time someone was really fond of me .
but i did use to look after the boats .
the captain had not so much as a dog to protect him .
almost as though she got a sudden warning to go from someone .
inspector leach thought to himself : these athletic chaps certainly take themselves seriously .
i am justas ive often told youi am just passing by .
looks as though it were murder , doesnt it , though of course the police are too cagey to say so outright .
there , there , my little one , he said , patting the girl on the shoulder .
you and joanna dont mind what you say about people ; anything will do so long as its sufficiently ill-natured .
jacqueline got up too .
yes , yes , she must have been here .
that i am afraid for my reputation ?
it is too much !
theres wasnt much time , of course , but i finished the sentence .
why are you mocking at me ?
and , whats more , i must be doing it very well because she hasnt the least idea .
he was a gambler , though , and gambled it away again .
her face fell also .
the party came into being at half past seven .
ingless words with the closest attention .
hes made a routine search of the house by agreement with miss blacklockbut he didnt find anything significant .
ive nothing to go onnothing whatever , she said .
because it appears so complex .
has iss .
its her glove all right .
it was an inside job .
i suppose it was natural , really , when one comes to think of it .
ii misunderstood you for a moment .
some of them had mothers , but never mothers who seemed to be any goodmothers who were quite incapable of protecting their daughters from silly affairs , illegitimate babies , and early and unfortunate marriages .
calgary closed the door after his visitor had entered .
so youve swallowed all this , hook , line and sinker ?
we take it very seriously indeed , mr .
and miss collins lying ?
the newcomer screamed : whyif it isnt mr .
all you will get is a lie .
carstairs , lady carmichael .
somebody was moving stealthily about the house .
what you have told me is very serious , lady dwighton .
poirot looked at me long and thoughtfully before he replied : i am not sure , hastings , that i had better tell you .
so she allowed herself to be guided through a gateway and up a winding path climbing up more or less outside the city walls .
wheres that glass you were drinking out of just now ?
but i understand that at some time you expressed admiration of some of the pictures to the deceased .
well , she isnt , said mr .
what should i know about her ?
no , said renisenb , struck by this aspect of the question .
oh really , inspector , i do think youre being very , very silly .
not put to some other use by someone .
i didnt say anything .
miss bulstrode spoke to her about her projected studies and was relieved to find that she answered promptly in excellent english and without giggling .
she was trembling violently , and her eyes , dilated and frightened , were staring at the crimson stain slowly soaking through simons trouser leg just below the knee where he held a handkerchief close against the wound .
its a pretty idea that somebody framed mebut i dont think its true .
i did my best .
if royalty can do it , i used to say to myself , you can do it , zachariah osborne !
would she be back now , do you think ?
poirot murmured : my orderly mind , that is vexed by trifles !
she called on mrs .
a little over three months .
he has just arrived in london , i see by this , i said , tapping the letter .
suppose you are really a slave of the drug habit , is there any cure ?
the police are trying hard to track down that man ellis .
shes leaving today .
miss howard ?
crale screamed and miss williams hurried back .
hes head over ears in love with jane .
well , perhaps im wrong , said tuppence .
he was a magnificent rider , and apparently well off .
i dont much what about joyces mother whom we are on our way to see ?
and he saw in imagination a fatherly superintendent , or a good-looking young inspector , tactfully murmuring : thank you , maam , very grateful to you , im sure .
carla had a sudden feeling of someone in the room , gathering shape , listening , breathing , waiting .
is it one of yours ?
at salisbury we had a pleasant time among happy english people , and from there archie and i went on a quick trip to the victoria falls .
i expect she got bored , like girls do .
i said no , i wasnt flying , i was going by sea .
i have always had and still have the utmost belief in m .
capel was excitedcuriously so .
you will advise us ?
i mean , there were people here , i should think , people perhaps among security forces .
he was safe .
tonight , admittedly , we have played the comedy .
things are getting serious , said anthony to himself .
do you happen to know th 	- 	c mmaen name oi your 	maternal grandmother ?
from time to time he nodded his head .
that was after supper ?
i burst out at that .
because we think so , too , said dakin .
the features are almost identical .
sergeant cadwallader and i , he announced , turning to face the assembled company , will want to go over mr warwicks collection of weapons very carefully .
i too find it sad sometimes .
she had the gift , often possessed by those who are too occupied with their own thoughts to pay attention to what others are saying , to come to the heart of the problem .
two witnesses were produced who had seen a butchers cart drive up to the bungalow on that monday morning , and the local butcher testifed that his cart only called there on wednesdays and fridays .
i am often here in carnival time .
yes , i said , i understand .
both place and time are incidental to the story .
you think that he mayknow something ?
and , as i say , sailing round this coast is good fun .
marshams letter ?
the modern girl has a thoroughly business-like attitude towards life .
presently he gathered up the sheets , enclosed them in an envelope and sealed them up carefully .
but id just rather like to have a look at the place , and this disappearing archdeacon of yours , or whatever he is , makes rather a good excuse .
now tell mewhats all this about ?
i remember , he murmured .
one was horbury , who might have got to know the combination and have crept in and stolen them during the night .
well , no , i wasnt .
it seems to me we have much the same problem here .
she looked at him in wide-eyed astonishment .
i was thinking that as dr .
she said nothing at all during the drive back to tottenham court road .
but she walked bravely up to the bureau and produced her card , and asked for count streptitch without a shade of hesitation in her manner .
possibly it didbut he wasnt going to admit any such thing .
the facts will tell against him , said poirot .
no , im youre just an agent , i suppose .
those two people that norton had seenhad they been judith and franklin ?
oh , well , i know a she when i come across a she .
she doesnt come from this part of the world .
i would not quite say that , miss martindale .
terribly .
the coat he was wearingperhaps the sergeants got that too , has he ?
he was sweeping in the drive when i got here , lou offered .
all these things i have done from my youth upwards !
we carried out this plan forthwith .
breaking down a patients resistance to analysis is sometimes a very long business .
and nobody thought of the mule trick or anything like it ?
and i realized that that was the pitfall he was striving at all costs to avoid .
wonderful what good luck a handsome young man always has .
they go out .
) in april the following year , it opened in the west end where it ran for a few months at the st martins theatre (where a later christie play , the mousetrap , was to run forever) .
i expect mitzi , our mittel european , would love that .
galbraith himself .
i invent them .
well , people are like that too .
it was a grave , friendly smile , with confidence in it and pleasure .
the swing doors were pushed open and a middle-aged lady came out and paused uncertainly on the step .
it is stupid , that , poirot commented .
i would indeed like to see you so much .
elinor said slowly : of course , it doesnt much matter which of us gets it , as were going to be married .
there was nothing suspicious or out of place anywhere .
a pity corjeag couldnt have finished what he was going to say .
luke bent his steps towards the old hall .
carrie louises granddaughter .
and the jewels brought over by aeroplane with my best friend as pilot .
he went to the desk and asked miss gorringe for the hotel register .
he looked up at the balcony .
he spoke excitedly .
of course you know , said van aldin .
there are some on the kitchen things , but i expect theyll turn out to be the maids .
she bent down to him and he felt the warmth of her lips on his , felt her love enveloping him , shielding him , and happiness flowered in that cold desert where he had lived alone so long .
i say , yes , madameoh , perfectly , madameprcisment , madame .
gwenda said thoughtfully .
inspector neele reflected for a moment .
no , six to one on ruskin , was jeremys guess .
was there a railway guide lying about ?
and perhaps it is gastritis .
he went to the kitchen .
i came to myself with a shock .
roddy , too , had looked forward to hunterbury being his home .
a rather unexpected smile lifted the corners of his sad-looking mouth .
after the excitement , she slept heavily and dreamlessly .
' yes , my friend - the little attache-case !
what did you think of her ?
and in that mood of triumphant satisfaction , he went with his wife for a fortnight to st .
the voice of a man , uttering one word at frequent intervals .
mortimer would come here after his father and perhaps bring up a family here , too .
whats our next move ?
i shant push myself forward or urge my own opinions .
poirot tiptoed along to the door at the end of the hall labelled residents only .
she brought me out here with her .
she was a pretty girl and quite young .
satterthwaite bustled forward and buttonholed the producer .
he took a bottle , a sponge and some rags from his pocket .
she was , i knew , the fifth daughter of an impecunious irish peer , and the duke of southshire was one of the best matches in england .
each one of you has something to hide .
real life isnt like that .
were situated .
rafiel to take his sea dip .
people are always telling you so .
everyone knows that they think hes the murderer .
' lord mayfield says that you wish to ask me some questions .
he is not a quack , madame , if that is what you mean .
it is probably just as well the children arent here .
nothing , mademoiselle .
tuppence was vaguewould she care to lunch ?
coarse kitchen salt , it looked .
but as yet , mon ami , we are not even sure that we have arrived at all the dramatis personae in the drama .
cedric , he lives abroad somewhere .
i realized myself the other night when rosamund shane made an unexpected remark what happens on such an occasion .
such often have the most violent feelings .
hello , henry , clarissa replied .
and would any woman , miss marple wondered , come to bertrams hotel for an assignation with a man ?
well , watch your step in future , he said .
they found hed had a lethal dose of something that only a doctor could pronounce properly .
poirot , if you understand what i mean , it wasnt as much of a shock as it would have been to anyone in full possession of her health and faculties .
rupert rose with dignitysuch dignity as his lanky and awkward age allowed , and delivered a final ultimatum .
her guests are her nephew raymond west , the novelist , and his fianc , an artist named joyce lemprire ; dr pender , the elderly clergyman of the parish (what , one wonders , has happened to the rev .
feeling destructive , said mrs .
what about boyfriends ?
now , though he doesnt know it , hes up against a tough proposition .
did she care very much ?
a worn ascetic face .
she must be , i suppose , well over forty , but she is a remarkably beautiful woman still .
i had my friends and my mother had one or two close friends whom she saw , but there was little social interchange .
hyoscine hydrobromide .
you and i have a principle in common .
the light was too dim to show more than that something dark was trickling over her fingers .
thats why i was so terrified that youd killed him .
i had builders in attendance ready to take out the squash court door and its framework if necessaryand this they had to do because the sofa and chairs would not go through the narrow doorway .
well , sorry i bothered you , derek , but keep a look out for undesirables in the background .
onlysometimesthe most amazing impersonations did happen .
probably not , said stafford nye .
justice wargrave said : one more of us acquittedtoo late !
and i have given mrs .
it was the same man !
ive never had any experience of this sort of thing .
now will you just tell me in your own words exactly what happened last night ?
she wasnt angry at all .
he went out with dignity and closed the door behind him .
from time to time he amused himself by placing a stake .
its a possibility , isnt it ?
that , said poirot , is a typical english idea .
thanking marcus for the drink and again refusing a second , victoria went up to her room , removed her shoes , and lay down on her bed to do some serious thinking .
did you ever know him at all ?
it had been exciting , to begin with , to be writing bookspartly because , as i did not feel i was a real author , it was each time astonishing that i should be able to write books that were actually published .
you have not changednot in the least have you changed !
the old lady should leave everything to her , and she would have all the money .
i wonder if the glove is also with a smile poirot drew from his pocket a second glove and placed it by the first .
at any rate that would make a row , and someone might hear it .
the poor captain is beside himself , hes nearly mad .
what a hateful world !
in some ways the communists and the others have taught us a lesson .
winnies , you used to say .
hed been an unsatisfactory suitor of lucys , and it had been decided by her family that it was a good thing when the couple quarrelled and parted company .
franklin had mentioned the subject of taking her own life .
a bit vague , isnt it ?
weston said : so now its up to us .
dane calthrop told me .
well , that narrows it down for all practical purposes .
he isnt really australian , explained alexander courteously .
she got no word of any kind .
oh dear , she said .
it is to be presumed that the lonely little god knew the black ingratitude of human nature .
you also are your fathers sonand you may go the same way .
he felt the whole place to be subtly evil .
i dont suppose youd know her .
i suppose his wife , poor thing , was one of those dim , jealous womenprobably always making a fuss about his better-looking lady patients .
there seemed what i might call a spite against me .
in it was a silver fruit knife .
a little frown had settled on sir jamess brow .
you agree , m .
there was a screaming , tearing sound , and a heavy explosion which shook the room .
just nosing around , was how sir charles had put it .
com contents problem at pollensa bay about the author the agatha christie collection copyright about the publisher problem at pollensa bay the steamer from barcelona to majorca landed mr .
you see , i never read any account of the inquest or anything like that or the enquiry into it .
and ruth smiled to herself a little at the idea .
he nodded towards the lavatory compartment .
his hustling activities were not confined to london , and his abrupt appearances and disappearances were fully accepted by the young adventurers as part of the days work .
thank you , mrs worrit .
fumbling a little , miss marple opened a small reticule , took out a little notebook , tore out a leaf , carefully wrote a name on it and folding it in two , handed it to sir henry .
the third one was a young man with beetle brows who frowned and to whom perpetual suspicion seemed to be second nature .
in his quiet pedantic voice , arthur calgary went on : when i came here first , it was not , as i thought , to bring you what might be described as tidings of great joy .
the judge nodded .
greenholtz was standing in the doorway observing her .
his craving for the sea was inborn .
jane , her colour rising a little more , described their meeting in the corner house .
i soothed her as best i could and made my escape .
poirot looked a little puzzled , but decided not to inquire into the inward meaning of the mysterious phrase elbow grease .
have you this brooch that was mentioned ?
a place for everything and everything in its place .
i have retired from active participation in the affairs of this country , but i am still a consulting authority .
it added that it was sorry i had been troubled .
among the effects of my martyred master they have not discovered been .
armstrongs colleagues and their present whereabouts .
the grim tragedy below was almost forgotten .
you met themwhat do you feel about them both , mrs .
quite true , he said .
its my experience , sergeant , that a man who makes enemies in one place will make them in another , but i agree that we cant put that possibility entirely aside .
they were driving now through the suburbs of baghdad .
there was , therefore , hope .
organ grinder complete with monkey , he murmured , fixing the baron with his eye .
which ties it in , very definitely , with someone in this house .
actually handing the forceps to doctor yourself !
she dealt with it with tweezers , then subjected her face to a minute scrutiny in the clear sunlight .
whose bag was it ?
and she has courage and personality .
he acted upon no settled plan , but proceeded in exactly the same way as he was wont to embark upon the search for his wifes missing handbag or his own spectacles when either of those essential articles were mislaid .
had it been otherwise , had mrs .
though your husband is terribly upset he does not react as you had hopedso you are forced to put your plan of murder into action .
he turned , his manner grim .
franklin spent a long time with him .
and a maniac does not care who he kills .
she drowses most of the time .
everyone gasped .
i screamed .
first the doctor come .
adelas voice was brisk and relieved .
it was , as we could see , an ordinary piece of end house notepaper with writing on it .
and you shall go with me .
for some time he hunted through the woods , but could find no sign of anything unusual having occurred .
she thinks at once that her love will reform him .
did you draw gelerts copse ?
she wasnt , anyway !
just stiff , thats all .
he said , uneasily : i hope i havent done her harm .
well , yes , i think so , he said with complacency .
the chief-inspector kept asking me why i was there and i couldnt tell him .
william and mary bureau .
esa gave a dry chuckle .
otherwise , you know , people will go on with the thing .
and then they analyse the remaining tablets and find nearly half of them have been replaced by aspirin .
satterthwaite looked out of the window .
widburn brightly .
gwenda shook her head .
and left them together .
not perhaps , in quite so obvious a form as banknotes , or gold , or jewellery , but nevertheless they were potential money .
ackroyd considered him a most able secretary .
why was the mill house chosen for the murder ?
psychologically to be expected , eh , doctor ?
kelsey had used in a dictionary , but couldnt get any sense out of it .
recreations : travelling , big game hunting .
he turned .
well , said mr clancy , it might have been absolomsor theres mitchell & smith .
did you help her to kill herself ?
would you have read it ?
ingratitude is what you meet with first and last in this life .
will there be blood on his clothes ?
now what i want to get right about your policy in india is this the men passed and went on down the corridor to macqueens carriage .
come in here , and she led me into the drawing-room .
no , said vole .
do you recollect that ?
she was very excited about it .
same popularity .
i know im mad , darling , but i cant help it .
you see , i didnt really see her .
yahmose asked gently .
the mere fact of making a will seems to bring the possibility of death nearer to them .
never forget a name .
oh , yes , quite a number of people .
what do you call these ?
i dont know exactly what brings about a friendship between man and womanmen do not by nature ever want a woman as a friend .
arent you an artist , too , m .
in fact , she almost wished that desmond had not come down here at all .
i think youre doing very well indeed , said richard pleasantly .
' floated out of the darkness .
suddenly there was a slight outcry .
satterthwaite studied him with interest .
i simply cannot decide .
in fact , the only way is to compare people with other people you have known or come across .
she met his inquiring glance with a flush .
i do remember one incident when i was staying in a house-party in ireland later .
she went methodically about her task , binding raoul securely to his chair .
opportunityand motive .
but not quite as nice as torquay .
im fed up with the old ass anyway .
the key had fallen out of her bedroom door , and whilst she stared at it , she heard the sound of the lock turning .
laura gave a sharp exclamation and tried to snatch the lighter up , but starkwedder had already done so , and was examining it .
i can count up to five or six men in london who wouldnt burst into tears if they read my obituary in the times .
but half the time he makes me do it .
bentley .
may i assist at your interview ?
the eatableit is not permitted .
addie nodded .
oh , you mean the lawyer who wrote to you .
i know , said miss marple apologetically , that ive got wasps on the brain .
but wont she deny the whole thing anyway ?
at the wheel sat a young man , his hair blown back by the wind .
he handed me the incriminating papers .
at the earliest opportunity i made a pretext for calling on simon clode .
iii been enjoying yourself with your tame american ?
well , really , m .
nofret is too clever for that .
she usually seemed to have something to work at .
the twitters were drowned by the booming noise of the station announcer saying loudly but indistinctly that the _num_ : _num_ was standing at platform _num_ and was about to proceed to various unidentifiable stations .
eastney had a lot to say about these last , for during the greater part of the war he had been engaged in their manufacture .
its not right , said mrs .
it tastes of fruit , of peaches .
you had to put down a lot of very difficult particulars and you didnt think it was nice .
poirot smiled slightly .
cayley was in a fretful mood .
if i knew what they were looking for in here his eyes went round the wrecked room .
might be barmy , suggested bacon .
have you gone quite crazy , kay ?
it was a small , rather austerely furnished room , but comfortable .
i know his secretary slightly , said victoria .
yes , in the aeroplane .
theyve sometimes got quite a big entourage with them , and orders get given twice and even three times over .
ex-inspector blore came my way quite naturally , some of my professional brethren discussing the landor case with freedom and vigour .
its lucky it wasnt worse , but thenyes , i think i can understand that .
my brother alexander has also defied the emperor .
nothing was spared us .
they stepped back along the corridor towards the stairs .
yes , butim sure i dont want to be rude about the government if youve got anything to do with it , but you know one really has the devil of a time getting anything out of it !
why susan , i should like to know !
once i had restored the circulation to my hands by rubbing the wrists vigorously , i was able to undo the gag .
his answer was that the stone was not a diamond .
japp had followed his glance .
she looked up at the sky , and in doing so stepped into a dark puddle by the gatepost , but without apparently noticing it she went on .
nononot the way you mean .
she had not seen him come back but she had heard the sound of the typewriter a little later .
i thought then , and indeed have thought ever since , what a wonderful person max is .
a shabby old coat of harris tweed , a weather-beaten , pleasant , middle-aged face with somewhat faded blue eyes , a weak mouth , half hidden by a rather straggly moustache .
groves , thinks she can have two evening dresses , three cocktail dresses , and a suit every year without ever paying me a penny for them !
shell wait till this afternoon , i gather , or shell wait till this evening and shes quite capable , i should say , of spending the night here .
so suitable in every way .
he considered that point but he did not think that sonia was right .
would anyone want to inherit the house ?
no , somebody pushed pritchard over the cliff .
but this time he finds little to sustain his infatuation .
sylvia chapman wasnt in the least that kind of womannot at all !
oh well , he said , richard and his guns were pretty fair nuisance value , you know .
then she descended again .
its my opinion that richard crale died of the shock .
nobody goes there much now .
would you like to see it ?
i dont believe youve got a sister , i laughed .
she made no trouble at all about having to go up and down four flights of stairs , which was more than i would have believed possible of any other nurse from mrs bouchers .
one could go right across the island without going through the hotel at all .
oliver , brightening .
she had committed suicide ?
motive , he said , ticking the points off on his fingers .
cayman at the inquest was such a shock to you !
she needs a new field in which to labour ?
hugo shouted .
women jump to conclusions that men do not .
i know all about the case , and the people at the house will do very well until tomorrow ; but , if were going to find a clue to the murderers , here is the spot we shall find it .
not extraordinary , no , said the inspector , smiling .
right , sir , im on , but , i say yes ?
no , that is true .
if it isnt urgent , sir george is in a terrible state and whats he in a state about ?
id want to hear from greta .
' donovan smiled ruefully .
to save the reader from continually having to make allowance for this six months , however , the dates here used as chapter headings are stated in terms of the agricultural year of the time , i .
they were seen through by one person .
by the way , uncle alington , where does the subconscious come in there ?
tell me about him .
five minutes delay , however , i allowed myself .
simon suggested .
just what do you mean by that question ?
all right , albert .
fifteen murder repeats itself come along , said inspector kelsey , entering the room with a grim face .
maybe the old boy had heard something about alex and was going to spill the beans to the serrocolds .
the waiter brought her drink .
i havent a shadow of proof , but i tell you , parker , i know when a chaps crooked !
that poor baby had to be vamped against his willgetting maddern a hornet every minute .
do you play a lot of golf ?
poirot observed : you said good night to him ?
i think , said poirot , that mademoiselle would appreciate better the reason for your questions if you told her just how the case stands .
funeral flowers , she said .
how was it fastened this morning ?
the long lashes drooped over the hazel eyes .
the trouble is , everythings possible , isnt it ?
poirot was content to watch the teeming activity of the station through a window pane .
they said they would rather have me , and i said : i should hope so , indeed !
it was very good of you to come , said mr .
several people have told me .
soldiers , said tuppence .
whilst it was clear that the woman herself could not have committed the crime , since at the moment the shot was fired mrs .
little tina .
i should .
the younger nun , trembling a little , started taking off her habit .
were you informed , by any chance , how and with what the girl was strangled ?
he came into my study and began fingering things and shuffling his feet and looking thoroughly embarrassed .
vincent started .
when we got on a boat to come back it was rough , and a large , hideously ugly spanish sailor took rosalind in his arms , and jerked up with her from the boat to the gangway .
poirot , the murder of marlene tucker doesnt make sense .
she died .
not that i know about .
a shadow crossed the nurses face .
ten minutes later ?
youve forgotten the most important of the lot .
and it seemed to me this time that his annoyance was principally at the cable having arrived just at this moment when he was entirely preoccupied with the arrangements for the party he was giving .
he revenged himself for not understanding it by saying coldly : thats the hamateurs point of view .
its the duty of someone who loves them to take the decision .
but , seriously , in spite of what i heard you say to the detectives , you surely cannot still believe in the possibility of alfred inglethorps innocence ?
there was a man shot yesterday , she said slowly .
davenheims study stands a safe , and that safe had been broken into and rifled .
then it is not true , madame , what i have heard , that there was a certain tensenessan uncomfortable atmospherehere ?
she didnt chop the back of her head in herself .
masterton interrupted herself to yell to a gardener .
nobody in the house but the daughter and the maid .
shes a very remarkable old lady , you know .
robin was contrite .
the sea so peaceful todaysometimes so cruel the sea that dragged you down to its depths .
you said just now that you had not met this greta andersen .
tomorrow cominganother day .
she was quite a friend of coras .
farley , he said carefully , was rather a peculiar man .
hester argyle drew in her breath sharply .
my friend , i will say this to youi hope it was he .
oh yesthat is what you would say !
a few silver photograph frames about in the old-fashioned manner .
hes downstairs with the doctor .
to think she should own a coat like thatshe could never quite get over the wonder of it .
here there was a small formal gardenthe privy garden , it was always called , and there was some point in the name , for it was surrounded by high holly hedges , and even the entrance to it ran zigzag between the same high prickly hedges .
they thought that somewhere in that house was valuable evidence of some kind .
her back was to mr .
i suggest a little digging party tomorrow morning .
not as dumb as all that , i said .
you know how he throws temperaments .
added poirot , with a slight twinkle .
no , no , murmured henrietta .
lorrimer , that with a weapon like that a woman could do the trick just as easily as a man .
father went to the door , then turned and asked : by the way , is lady sedgwick a director of your company ?
isnt there a caf or some place like that in the town ?
what i mean is , hes all wrong .
no , it isnt , confessed battle .
com for exclusive information on your favorite harpercollins author .
impudence !
i make my decision and i answer , yes .
i felt poirot was being overoptimistic .
what happens , said hilary , if i reach journeys end ?
a lapse of memory ?
poirot , if you had been to petra you would realize that the journey there was a somewhat strenuous business for an old woman whose cardiac condition was unsatisfactory .
magdas voice dropped to its former subdued tone .
the hypodermic tablets , of course , are what are in general use , and it appears that morphine hydrochloride is more often used than the tartrate .
now , without any previous warning , colonel race stood up and made his speech .
youd like to tidy this up , too , i suppose ?
she thrust it on him and poirot had a sudden poignant memory of a child he had known who had thrust on him one of her treasuresa special shell picked up on the seashore and zealously guarded .
an ideal spot for a murder , in fact , said mr .
cant you find out anything from the postmark ?
i know its awful , but i am really cheerful because wilfred has gone away .
they heard the sharp intake of the others breath .
it has discouraged you , reading them ?
teti has forgotten already .
whats trumps ?
even the curt monosyllables that he had uttered , thinking that they at least could not lead to misapprehension , had reappeared in his mornings papers in a totally different guise .
an old friend of yours is here , my dear lady .
he slapped his pocket .
the eyewitness _num_ .
your wife is very kind , mr .
theyre dreadful .
thats all right by me .
' ' you can put that right out of your mind .
dont you touch a dead bird , said mrs .
but you mustnt always believe what freddie says .
ii meant well .
number _num_ , did you say ?
fishas the object of their conversation drew nearim planning a peaceful afternoon for you .
i think she was very brave .
she stared at him incredulously .
point number three , the putting on of the clock ten minutes all inside jobs .
what injury ?
shes got blue eyes .
bouc remarked , the case seemed fantastically impossible !
dont hang about , and dont stand there with your mouth open .
now , can you help us in any way , miss waterhouse ?
she could have gone away , i suppose ?
well , my friend , i saw there was just one chance .
there may possibly be something in the house that may throw light upon this sad business , but i rather doubt it .
we havent done any questioning of the household yet .
i read the pickwick papers once .
this is indeed a pleasure .
she wouldnt have time to notice a mere man .
it was as though a net was closing tighter and tighter round her .
inspector sharpe remained brooding for a few moments .
it was the butlers voice , still quavering and uncertain .
someone else that he was coshed .
if you will not think me presumptuous , madame .
he said : what the hell do you mean by that , dr .
im not a reporter or anything like that .
yes , finney agreed , he was a wrong un .
henrietta seldom talked of her workwas indeed less obsessed by it than most artists he knew .
how many children have you ?
again her visitors eyes strayed to the preparations on the table .
macqueen stared at him .
or he may have left it to ruth .
well , lance hesitated and frowned , not exactly .
it belonged to her father .
owen (to give him the name he himself has adopted) is on the island .
he looked embarrassed , and it occurred to me that he might have been listening at the door .
it was the prime minister !
and indeed the bald statement , made unemotionally in the open air of the quiet english countryside , did seem curiously lacking in reality .
she began to speak more convincingly .
even the willetts havent got a private aerodrome .
when i returned to the house , however , glover told me that he was in his study .
i do not think there is anything i could possibly tell you .
the doctor stared at me .
suddenly however , mrs .
many a case of arsenical poisoning has been diagnosed as acute gastro enteritis and a certificate givenespecially when there are no suspicious contributing circumstances .
i was left with the dismayed feeling that i had done more harm than good .
but it is absurd to think of her in such a connection , and outside her i can think of nobody .
well , you havent !
they reached le caveau and descended into a kind of cellar where they found a table spread for supper and lit by old-fashioned candles in candlesticks .
i guess thats what youre after , monsieur poirot though how you know about it fairly gets my goat !
have i got to come to scotland yard ?
i see , mademoiselle , that you have inherited your fathers intelligence .
so sure of herself , benevolent , tyrannicala kind of living walking embodiment of mother knows best .
mr ditchburn uttered a sardonic laugh and relapsed into silence .
a tinge of colour came into mr .
very necessary , im sure , said miss marple , especially in these times with taxation and everything .
how do you know you did ?
she was capricious in her favours .
jennifer , jennifer , i want you .
i think that tonight i shall turn in early .
chapman , that what you have just told us is very serious ?
' pull yourself together .
and then , i continued , there came the excitements of the inquest .
he lent it to me , and from that moment i realise that something happened to menot a change of heart , not quite a change of outlook , but somehow i saw things more in proportion ; myself less large ; as only one facet of a whole , in a vast world with hundreds of inter-connections .
persuaded sister m .
fifty pounds entrance fee , and lots to be drawn .
i said painfully .
sir rowland made an exclamation of annoyance .
he called it project benvo .
there is certain testimony with which one cannot afford to disagree .
she was .
and i think she did the right thing .
poirot beamed on her .
nothing emphasized .
he could only just have gone under .
and how on earth was she going to take cover or hide .
and it was then , with her usual genius for accuracy , that she pulled out a canvas that was leaning with its face to the wall .
i was in her bathroom taking in the clean towels , and i listened at the door .
my boy , said the vicar .
and she used to go to norway with painting things as an artist .
ever since i left victoria i have had a horrible feeling of somethingsomething that is coming to me very soonthat i cant escape .
he had seemed older , heavier .
maude stopperton , fourth daughter of _num_ rd baron cotteril .
what about our murderer ?
miss hinchcliffe .
they were always doing it .
the mystery of the missing attach case .
lennox boynton had passed the stage of revolt .
they must have gone dangerously near to mr .
i was afraid youd say that , said frankie with a sigh .
andrew pennington felt absentmindedly for a chair and sat down .
they were the ones who had the ideas .
i suppose , said tuppence , that this was one of the alterations they made to the house when they wanted to use it as a hiding place .
trouble about the vests for instancefor vest read hair shirt with all its associationsand the whole thing becomes quite plain .
narrative of meredith blake dear mr .
he persisted .
gaitskill rang us up , my father said , and apprised us of the main contents of the will and i asked him to come round and bring the two documents with him .
ive tried every mortal blessed thing .
i wonder who propped her up there .
poirot said : do you think it is possible that he could have shot your brother ?
just one thing .
miss marple asks her highly efficient and intelligent young friend lucy eyelesbarrow to infiltrate the crackenthorpe family , who seem to be at the heart of the mystery , and help unmask a murderer .
just because one of these gossiping old cats had nothing better to do than look out of her window all night you go and pitch upon me .
but i can see that hes puzzled and uneasy , and hes always altering the medicine , but nothing does any good .
the chauffeur helped the occupants out .
after a brief nervous smile at poirot , lucia quickly left the room .
as far as i can see it must be in the room as it isnt on you .
because i turn switch and nothing happen .
i have a sensitive ear , you know .
a far-away look came over monsieur papopolous noble countenance .
and i know what these official analyst people are like .
i mean , its all very well for me to go along and ask for news of my stepmother whom i barely remember .
i pulled myself together .
the colonial touch , said the inspector .
she had gone back to her own people , but he was still married to her , you understand .
with a sense of annoyance she realized that she was quite unaware of edwards last name .
he went on : lets take ( _num_ ) .
on the balcony above his wife came out and collected the bathing things .
then , seeing him handling the cigarette box , she became anxious .
as rowena drakes husband had recently died she would inherit everything .
has it got a four-poster with little chintz roses ?
then what am i to do with them ?
its certainly true that if ever a woman deserved to be murdered mrs .
quite simply and naturally she related her conversation with ruth kettering , word for word as nearly as she could .
she had a pretty pink and white face , and she smiled at tuppence in a friendly manner .
his fingers beat a meditative soft tattoo on the edge of the table .
lets have a few deductions from you .
he had regained his composure , but as he took off the pince-nez he habitually wore and polished them i observed that his hand was shaking .
sutro , i think .
old lady angry , you say ?
i mean , theres such wonderful confectionery out here .
a terrible discovery was made on the following morning .
wait while i askis alex about the house , do you know , gina ?
the man nodded .
those abernethies again !
at last the girl gave a sign .
we were , i think , a little resentful of his marrying again so soon , but of course one knows that on board ship the influence of propinquity is very greatand he may also have thought that it would be a good thing on your account .
yes , agreed giles .
nothing is impossible , but it doesnt seem like it .
you see , you too have the same point of view .
anthony asked me to marry him before we left little priors .
unpack that bag !
gillian noticed his absorption .
victoria felt her usual annoyance and dislike of catherine rising .
aha , i know the one you mean .
but my fondness didnt blind me from seeing exactly the kind of silly little fool she wasand even telling her so upon occasions !
the case against abbot .
that were lily all over .
one of the great mysteries of st .
mademoiselle , i said , it is sometimes difficult for a dog to find a scent , but once he has found it , nothing on earth will make him leave it !
what on earth had i to gain by murdering ackroyd ?
im glad of that , said miss marple gravely .
i came that wayi dont remember why .
it was in the pocket of an old dressing gown .
laverguier has a method most excellent for averting the mal de mer .
moved the furniture about a bit , i suppose , got cushions and things of that sort about .
theyre all much the same , those houses round the links .
thats it really , isnt it ?
on one side the manufacture of atom bombs , on the other our newspapers delight in reporting brutal murders !
dakins shoulders drooped less , his manner was less hesitating .
it made me think of an arsene lupin story where there was something hidden in a mans glass eye .
she was swearing an artfully-cut russet sports-suit that showed up the warm lights of her hair .
well , you see , sir , it was different .
about thirty-seven or -eight , i should think .
he might have goneanywhere .
living in a flat alone in borodene mansions , poirot could understand and feel the sort of woman she was , and had been , and he could see why such a woman might wish to throw herself out of a high window one early morning when she awoke to despair .
oliver , major despard looked slightly taken aback .
it merely confirmed him in his long-held belief that you should never believe anything anyone said without first checking it .
griffith .
but i do think , nigel , that you sometimes exaggerate .
when is the date of the full moon ?
life classes have much to answer for !
victoria nodded .
true love rewarded ?
he turned to dr .
i guess wed better get on the track of boris .
the inspector looked at her quickly as she went on , i divorced my husband many years ago .
you can never really say that anything is finished .
she looks to me as though she were going off her head .
i bet hes got a nose for money all right !
all of em .
vera said : theres no one on the islandno one at allexcept us two .
private secretaries havent much time for that sort of thing , said colonel melrose , smiling .
you told me today , mr .
but i think youre about right when you say that shes the hub of the case .
badcocks ?
he stopped a minute .
harter with no more than a trace of interest .
my stick , he explained , as he rejoined us .
also i learn that a swarthy man , a foreigner of some kind , was inquiring about the occupants of no .
the igspector _num_ cked the door .
willett , not at all .
lawyers , as i have told your wife , are cautious people .
a few moments later he brought the required refreshment to where tommy had slumped down in the worn but comfortable chair reserved for his special use .
behind that mask his agile brain looked ahead to the next move .
perhaps , she suggested , the gas tap of the fire was leaking .
she added , i wonder why bully wanted to get in touch with mummy so badly ?
he hurried out into the corridor .
i think the best plan would be for miss deane to come out and lunch with me .
the colonel took it from her and inscribed in the corner a minute p .
he moved to the table near the door and took a coffee cup from the plant bowl .
proud , she was always proud as the devil .
as he passed through the hall he was greeted by one more friend : dr .
i remember the mayor all right .
why should i pinch it ?
what you say amazes me .
charles kent _num_ .
theres something deuced mysterious about her being down here anyway .
the message on it was quite short .
he was a small rotund man with a semi-bald head and a twinkling eye .
he called on you at your hotel that daythe day of the revolution , i mean .
but surely that was impossible .
on the other hand it may not .
sir henry clithering smiled .
' he sniffed at it delicately .
i wondered what all the noise was in here .
elsie holland gasped out : oh , mr .
then , heart beating a little faster , she gave the best imitation she could of the hoot of an owl .
yes , he added , you are to be envied .
ill try and make what i mean clear .
he died last year .
corrigan has told me of his meeting with you .
it has quite upset me .
calvin bakers a shrewd woman .
you forget how ill the poor boy is .
but sometimesit makes life difficult .
she grasped for one of the basket chairs and sat down .
prejudiced .
not the kind to do murder ?
interesting , he remarked .
i was going through a difficult time .
whats the matter , nurse ?
he spoke in a businesslike , matter-of-fact voice as though what he asked was an unimportant detail .
she hadnt any of the ordinary unpleasant vices .
no , said miss marple , he couldnt have been sure .
of course tommy will be all right , said tuppence impatiently .
you have guessed my secret .
whittington went on : been playing with me , have you , all the time , like a cat and mouse ?
she likes to interfere with anyone else enjoying themselves .
going over the facts very carefully , id say that that hypothesis is at least possible .
cant you feel the way it wants to goit wants to slide inkeep your hand flat till you get the feeling of itdont just push it anywherefeel it .
amy , dear , such ages .
you can turn up anywhere looking pathetic and mourning some brave young airman .
there was a fur chest in a flat there , and in that fur chest there had been found a body .
ive got my reasons .
ive noticed that .
youve got a good deal to explain , morelli .
he had picked up a wood pigeon , and from first telling us how he had been laughed at at his prep school for being sick when he saw a rabbit killed , had gone on to the subject of grouse moors , telling a long and rather pointless story of an accident that had occurred in scotland when a beater had been shot .
she was a little faded woman , with a colourless face , meagre hair scraped back from her forehead , and a perpetually nervous manner .
i had rather lost hope by now .
so little ; i see that now .
it isnt , really it isnt .
you told me that she was not pleased to find boyd carrington having his fortune told by nurse craven .
i may have been a littleerpersonal now and then .
she hoped he would be pleased about the will and not annoyed .
but i must not detain you , mademoiselle .
rices version of the trouble with the motor .
the story of a girl , sure of herself , modern , independent .
his eyes burnt into hers .
there was a dead silence .
where people used to do the flowers .
we have had a small bungalow on the river at marlow , quite close to the mill house , for over five years .
ive a good mind to throw you out of the window .
victoria meditated on these points .
well , my father will have to reckon with me .
and me asleep in my bed as innocent as can be .
at the same moment a taxi lingering in a pleasant tempting manner , came along .
most of the men were helping .
but that cant be so , she said .
shes an attractive lady , i understand .
she had her breakfast in bed , and she didnt get up all the morning , but at lunchtime she told me that she still hadnt been able to sleep .
hed probably have said he could look after himself and told you to go to the devil .
alix leaped to a knowledge born of instinct .
she gave a deep sigh and immediately terry , who slept on her bed , had moved up and was kissing her affectionately .
its not good news .
not really artistic at all , said tuppence , but i would love to arrange the stall for you .
what , then ?
since the girl was determined , i was forced to give in to her and we started at once , getting away before my sister was able to fire off any more pronouncements beginning with her favourite words , of course .
i endeavoured to follow her example .
isnt it the usual thing to do ?
he will think i have no courage , no strength of purpose .
what could we do ?
hubbards compartment was locked when he came in answer to her bell .
miss griffith looked faintly curious , but inspector neele had himself in hand again .
and she slipped away through the trees .
gregory came in with his usual hearty air .
welman taking such a fancy to mary .
i said slowly , so your case is eliminated down to those four miss ginch , mr .
but who ?
my attention was taken by a pile of luggage in the hall .
for the first time charles was given a full view of his antagonist .
i dont care if you never want to see me again .
cannot understand it .
archdeacon brabazon sighed .
bless my soul .
well , its like this .
thank you for coming .
george had done it on purposeseparated her from anthony .
julian harmon , theres going to be a murder at miss blacklocks .
he let her go at last , sick and weary of the vain endeavour .
then he , too , left the room .
because i consider it possible that an enemy , disappointed in the way you surmounted that crisis , might endeavour to stage a further dilemma .
but some names ?
he doesnt even see friends .
and having finished her supply in the chocolate box she asked madame just now for hers which was full .
youre lost in a daydream .
the answer ?
it was a melancholy and impressive ceremony .
ive got a few things to tell you , but nothing to this .
stayed at castle hotel for one night .
but then where did mrs .
finally poirot looked over at the upright figure of miss van schuyler in her corner .
howell was only too willing to talk about it , and was full of pitying ejaculations about the poor young gentleman , but bundle gleaned nothing new .
so did i , i thought as i groped for the lantern .
as melchett saw at once , the position of ruby keenes room was ideal for the purpose of leaving the hotel without being observed , and was particularly unfortunate from the point of view of throwing light on the circumstances of that departure .
i thought you were going to have everything ready , clarissa .
he died in his sleep , as people often do .
it must have fallen out .
he told me to take the evening off .
no , no , i mean more than that .
sir george marroway .
ive remembered , said sir charles , what struck me as odd .
you see , she died inwell , practically an asylum .
i have , moreover , powers unknown to my prototypedo i mean prototype ?
' ' your father ' s fortune passes to you ?
there have been precedents for murder there .
youre sure theres nothing more i can do ?
he was drinking a lot , too .
first sanseveratonow this young man .
some poison like arsenic could have been given that way .
he didnt care for our english winters .
miss marple said good-bye , saw she had another ten minutes to go and passed on to the post office .
that would have been risky too .
was he lying ?
it is as i am hurrying with sauce to m .
perhaps you are right , poirot , i said gently .
its valuable to keep to the last a person on whose judgement we can relya good observerby whom we can check what has been told us up to date .
i think josh was her husband .
words came back to mr .
the way she sympathized .
the inspector politely drew poirot back to the subject .
were right this time .
but i didnt fancy doing that sort of thing with mr .
mon ami , said poirot , my point is this : an affair must be judged by its results .
i was just saying , dear , wasnt i , what a very strange thing it was that dr carelli should turn up in the way he did , with no idea that you were living in this part of the world .
theres your mother , said ellie thoughtfully .
poirot moved towards the house and was cannoned into by a young man who was stepping backwards to take a better aim at a coconut .
clement ?
we heard quite often !
simply , madame , because i am hercule poirot .
miss pebmarsh couldnt have done im in , could she ?
perenna went inbut that was when the maids were there and she was just blowing them up about something .
but matters did not turn out quite as well as we had hoped .
i did nothing .
macwhirter .
anyway , said rose , geoffrey never goes to race meetings .
but i dont think you quite understand .
of ' he gives himself airs , ' she explained .
the constable read out what was on the slip of paper .
i dont think so , said poirot mildly .
two or three weeks , i expect .
though , as a matter of fact , i do happen to know what a wonderful man you are , interrupted loraine .
some of the staff had weekend leave , returning late sunday night or early monday morning .
no consideration for others .
a lump rose in sarahs throat .
instinctively i put my hands over my eyes .
popular in the neighbourhood , though some people were old-fashioned and didnt think two young ladies ought to be living alone .
im afraid we havent got anything really good , admitted bill .
who told you that , my friend ?
those scoreshow i enjoyed playing them !
she was being laced into a tight corset .
nice fellowbut not an idea of the commercial lifeand the commercial life its got to be nowadays if you want to keep your head above water .
just momentsand in between long empty spaces of months or even years .
ce pauvre despard !
lets go and get our bikes .
its kinder sad .
hardly in behaviour , said mrs .
i had a great deal of respect for sir eustaces shrewdness .
but the important thing is the scarf .
go on , all of you .
laura , wearing her dressing-gown , followed miss bennett into the room .
i felicitate you , hastings .
but time pressed .
my eyebrows had been cunningly altered , giving a totally different expression to my face , i wore pads in my cheeks , and the deep tan of my face was a thing of the past .
in betty barnard you found just the type of girl you were looking for .
just laughedthats all she did .
stung into further speech by poirots inquiring glance he continued desperately .
she whirled round on colin .
but i expect you know all about that already ?
she was a most interesting girlone of the most interesting pupils i have had .
fresh air blowing over sand dunes , tramping round with clubsswinging a drivera nice clean shot off the teea little chip with a mashie .
yesi think so .
found it in the shrubbery , said sergeant hay .
you say , that is not minemeaning that such a thing does belong to someone else .
my sister bought one at a sale .
rather significant , dont you think ?
i rather think , said miss marple , yes , i rather think that the whole thing was lies .
whats the flour game ?
i think thats quite possible , said mrs .
it seems to me , excluding the supernatural in which i do not for one moment believe , that that was the only way things could have happened .
poirot cried : ah , but my dear sir , the why must never be obvious .
as the inspector snatched the paper from him , clarissa and sir rowland looked at each other in astonishment .
no other friend of the girls ?
weve been married five years , you know , and after all , five years is quite a long time nowadays i have no doubt that in some cases it can seem an eternity , madame , said poirot dryly .
a murderer who might have already killed or one who might be preparing to kill .
albert eyed tommy , opened his mouth and shut it again several times , judging quite rightly that gloomy predictions on his part would not be welcomed .
youll take a pretty girl out to supperlike you did the night before last .
it was a childs weaponand shed probably never got out of using it .
thus challenged , i did a lightning calculation of chances .
shes ridden since she was a child , i understand .
the minutes passed , at interminable length .
but tommys common sense pointed out objections .
a littleer , tributetoto an occasion .
lady eileen bundle .
poirot and knighton conversed occasionally in low tones without disturbing him .
poirot said : it is necessary to clear up one or two points .
there was the imminence of the move back to town and the household problems involved in that move .
our conversation was incoherent and inconsequent .
i dont want to talk about it anymore .
do you thinkcould you get mesome brandy ?
whether shes barmy or not , i dont know , but she sticks to her storyabout what her friend saw and all the rest of it .
its like being tone deaf .
please , please , its the last thing i ask you .
it is my key .
tommy opened the small gate , went up a path and not seeing a bell applied himself to the knocker .
yes , ive come .
i took that snap to make sure .
tina said : i saw nobody .
jane answered the questions put to her clearly enough .
indeed , said poirot , that is very interesting .
nevertheless , though the story itself might be true , something lay behind it undivulged .
he thought to himself , will she run down soon like a clock or will this go on all the way to london ?
he was killed to prevent him telling what that something was .
he used to toss me up in the air and i remember being half frightened and half loving it .
ill take you .
leidner and carried him into his own room and laid him on his bed .
oh , aint it just like the pictures !
that large emerald was pawned last nightby one of the regular lot .
good lord , tommy looked at his watch .
if this business goes on as it has begun someone will probably send you a poisoned tarantula by post !
i cannot answer my professors questions good at all .
and you think he will be hanged ?
physically , she could quite well wear a liberty bodice still .
no , i said as a friend of mine knew a young gal .
she wouldnt be listening , and what she said , however haphazard and irrelevant , might lead to something .
he looked suddenly like a shy schoolboy .
i brought this out triumphantly , but poirot merely gave me a look of scorn .
it was on a hill top , and the hill top was planted with a few sparse pines .
spenlow ?
that lucky intended to try her luck again with another husband , and for that reason wanted not only freedom but the handsome inheritance that she would get as gregory dysons widow ?
hermia redcliffe , of course .
definitely loopy !
his daughter , lady eileen brent , known to her friends and society in general as bundle , laughed .
before i go home , i must have some really good shorts made in london .
she turned with relief .
yes , im sure i havebut i dont remember anything about him .
father is very well .
he had a suitable reverence for poirots achievements , with which he seemed to be well acquainted .
the latter had got rid of his skis and brushed off the snow and was holding in his hand a large notebook and pencil .
they walked up to the topmost stone .
babbington put his cocktail down , or did he retain it in his hand ?
she may have threatenecl him with that silly little pistol of hers .
thosethose friends of mine , i mean ?
i could afford to stay in the hotels , but it was the meals that were so expensive .
but one shouldnt be !
youve been watching me for the last day or two .
masses .
she was different today , said mrs .
joanna , put this bun in the wastepaper basket , will you ?
cyrus bradburn has been able to buy ashley grange and its contents forsixty thousand pounds , was it ?
a groan burst from sir george conway , outraged at such un-parliamentary frankness .
he is reported as having said that he wished to astonish the natives .
bill looked at his wristwatch .
she was not good-lookingplain ratherbut there was an intensity about her , a forcefulness that made her a person quite impossible to overlook .
i did write ?
i hate hens , said ginger .
oh , well , go on up and knock .
i heard as youve got some help at last , said mrs .
there dont seem to be any americans .
miss barrow was standing in the doorway .
not only was it enormous victorian gothic , with quantities of rooms , passages , unexpected steps , back staircases , front staircases , alcoves , nicheseverything in the world that a child could wantbut it also had three different pianos that you could play , as well as an organ .
hush , let us speak no more not that i expect anything to happen for some time .
mr bindler is the well-known literary critic , said raymond west .
wonder what its all about ?
death in the clouds ( _num_ ) from seat no .
it certainly might , said dr .
he received her with every sign of pleasure , established her in a chair , poured her some coffee and handed her a glass of kirsch .
he was in the church , dying .
well , ill be on my way .
he was marvellously and beautifully dressed .
at the same time the shadow of financial worry darkened .
was she nervous , then ?
no expense spared .
the hundreds of crimes that are solved and the perpetrators punished are seldom heralded and sung .
he is greater than any jesus that ever lived .
tell me , said sir henry , do you know a miss marple ?
llewellyn-smythe had ever done before .
the inspector added , its bad you know , that shes never said a word about being down there that day .
hori and yahmose had come up together .
cayley , who told him at interminable length all about his health .
that seems rather remarkable .
its not political at all .
he appreciated her business acumen , her boldness of planning and her grasp of detail .
ive often wondered , i said .
miss coombe , how long have you had this creature ?
she tiptoed in and shut the door carefully behind her .
bill eversleigh was rejected on the grounds of his height , weight and heavy tread , also for his general clumsiness , which latter clause he fiercely denied .
but at once lynns mind dropped from vague generalities to the immediate personal .
they sat down and started tea .
nobody in particularone of a thousand orange growers in the transvaal .
i cut short the conversation by remarking that that was where megan had better go now .
and when its all over we might go away somewhere .
the proportions of the table would have distressed superintendent hale , he would have complained that no known roses were precisely of that shape or colour .
we said no more , but fell into line .
what made you think of that ?
it was her whining voice , her continual self-pity and the occasional malicious pleasure she took in fanning the flames of a discussion .
theyve shown it me already , said mrs .
the woman with the beautiful face sat alone at a table in the corner .
was it possible that mrs .
and the police in every district are keeping a lookout .
someone who mattered .
poor man , he wasnt quite himselfhed begun to be ill .
the fee , shrimp , come to the blitz and follow the two strangers .
theyre sending down a chap tonight to vet the stone .
there was one nice one of me in cairo in one of my plainer hats , an enormous dark blue straw with one pink rose .
id have hans sachs sitting under his elder tree , saying of the world : mad , mad , all mad yesthat expresses it .
protheroe came to the study in the garden that day , but if you remember , in her evidence , she only came as far as the study window , not inside the room .
shall i bring lady stoddart-west up ?
the defensive armour of her arrogance broke down a little .
going to egypt was a great help to me .
and then , bonjour to our chances of catching him !
pace , and he seemed puzzled like , but he said to the mistress : excuse me , zoe , while i see what this fellow wants .
there is something here that i do not understand .
why , from all around people were paying their shilling to go in and see gossington hall and what had been done there , and hoped to catch a glimpse of marina gregg herself .
it was in the savoy outside her room that morning .
no , he said musingly , i dont .
what words did she use exactly ?
christine redfern glanced up at poirot in a slightly abstracted manner .
something i gathered , in the nature of a gigantic hoax .
demanded her father .
three the young solicitor george mayhew was cautious and non-committal .
you remained with her ?
we had a splendid time , we all liked each other , and the springs of the sofa were permanently broken .
a big rolls-royce car was waiting for us below , and as we glided off into the darkness , i plied poirot with questions .
it was about a month ago , mlady .
ill take you on for sixpence , loraine .
oh , you have , have you ?
she seems to feel it terribly now .
expect she comes out of this house .
someoneor something has given her that fear .
it will be quite unnecessary for my wife to come here , he said .
but we old buffers like to think that experience has taught us something .
after dinner .
dadll skin me alive , she whimpered .
that was the war , of course .
the conference had actually taken place ; starting at _num_ oclock this morning .
shall we sayto the person the thief thought you were .
i fancy that this is a young man we should all be very glad to lay our hands on .
he took her hand and shook it heartily .
people who drive down these lanes arent usually trying to get anywhere in particular .
im making it my subject .
the gardeners and poirot remained staidly sitting by the wayside whilst mrs .
she departed and tuppence sat down and said thoughtfully , i dont think i should like to swallow a thimble .
miss marple asked sharply : what was the first thing she said to you when you questioned her ?
do not distress yourself , my friend , said poirot .
no , it is here , sir , said emma , producing it .
this title was previously published as hickory dickory death .
and did he believe you ?
more than you think , my friend .
now , tell me the whole story .
on the centre of the rose pile carpet was a small piece of caked mud .
there was no doubt that he had a flair for these things .
he prowls about and keeps an eye on the house .
well , its a very good way of getting to know ones neighbours and all the people who live in the same village .
ii hercule poirot made a meticulous toilet , applying a scented pomade to his moustaches and twirling them to a ferocious couple of points .
you are looking instead for somebody who has committed a murder and got away with it , someone who never expected it to be found out and who suddenly got a nasty shock .
you want , i think , to examine the position very thoroughly before you commit yourself .
you suppose correctly , said mr .
the armchairs were squarely built , the upright chairs were angular .
that is why i thought the lady must have been dreaming .
i wasnt really at all surprised when the police called .
unkindness upsets me , as you know only too well .
mcgillicuddys train slowed down again and the other began to gain speed .
its completely isolated .
thats it over there , i expect , said susan , gesturing to the wall behind him .
boscowan well .
' voyons , mademoiselle ann/e , all that you shall tell us will be _num_ im trance .
all our lot were there yesterday , he said .
yes , we heard that mrs .
there might be ways .
i just like getting my facts straight .
i really dont know what i should do without snell .
edmunds rose .
he had bowed his head , then crossed and put the telegram into her outstretched hand .
what should i ?
and then , finding you looking like a total stranger !
we also learnt the names of the months as they were during the french revolution .
three i travelling to london in the corner of a first-class carriage mr .
you will permit me , mademoiselle ?
bobby was scrambling up the precipitous path .
no , i dont think it was then .
the position of women , over the years , has definitely changed for the worse .
with a sun helmet , sun glasses , black beard and a monks long woollen robe , a stranger could pass in without the servants realising that a stranger had entered .
yes , he said , she is all that you say .
its going to be all so difficult , i said weakly .
are you mad ?
no abandoned car found anywhere ?
my plane left at ten p .
what about despard ?
its date was _num_ .
two more points had to be settled .
beautiful as she had seemed before , it was as nothing to the loveliness that now went fully adorned .
desperately lou pounded on the door , calling and shouting .
his precious plan had gone wrong .
not a sound .
they do things which they honestly believe will make things better and then theyre surprised when they dont make things better because theyre not the things that people want to have .
i dont know who he is , but were all making the hell of a fuss about him .
oxford marmalade .
then we walked along the edge of the wood near where some of the other paths came out and sowe found her .
great changes there and everywhere nowadays .
i think , really , you have known exactly who i am from the first day you spoke to me .
however , their general purport seemed to be that frankie had a plan and that he (bobby) was to do nothing until he heard from her .
he is anxious .
or that he was alive until recently .
i think it was more that i refused to believe .
she added regretfully , but i know so little .
she had sat , not relaxed , but upright , as one sits in an airport lounge , or a railway waiting room .
there seems no doubt that there are those , like richard iii as shakespeare shows him , who do indeed say : evil be thou my good .
then sharply , youre not saying as anything as been stolen , are you ?
i know now .
tearing a blank half sheet of paper off an old letter , he sat down to compose a reference for a lorry driver in much the same terms , but using different wordingif this message was a code that took care of thatthough it was possible , of course , that there was a message written in some kind of invisible ink .
presently yahmose got up and went away , handing back the roll of papyrus to hori .
i havent put that very well , but you can guess what i mean .
baumgartens rooms where they had all three remained discussing certain courses of treatment until miss bellever had come hurrying in and asked dr .
if madame rice has a devoted friend who is rich and can give her all she needswhy then obviously madame rice would not need to murder her dearest friend for a mere pittance .
methods are rather crude , eh ?
but theres another test of murderone that is fairly accurate , but ratherdangerous !
mayherne hastily .
he rushed to the door and flung it open .
rogers was in the room , his hands full of garments .
he was a good shot and we had very happy days together in his family home of his boyhood .
the food , too , was unusually good .
asked virginia breathlessly , as bill left them .
you wouldnt do it !
shed been there a long time .
he gave another jump .
well , it seems rather odd .
' 	poirot came back to me as the door dosed .
shell be so relieved to know that my relations with joanna were purely of a business nature that shell forgive me everything else .
i became a worker for the resistance .
pauncefoot jones optimistically .
so you heard ?
its agreed , said mr .
she said : i owe a lot to himand to you .
there seems to be some idea that your uncle bob put something in my luggage to bring home .
you told me , said miss marple , you told me(as humpty dumpty saidvery loud and clear) that you had not left anything to esther walters in your will .
ive often thought of killing myself .
anything fresh to report , crossfield ?
of any known disease ?
blore was sitting squarely in a chair , his hands on his knees .
archie said he doubted if mr goldstein would do anything of the kind .
she was angry , revolted by his callousness and by his cruelty to the girl .
i thought if we could get together and share and share alike as it were .
that girl , race , is an absolute trump .
im sorry i couldnt do more for him .
if i do , will you let me go ?
i came in here , and there he was .
she laid them down on the hall table .
it was fun planning and deciding ; glorious fun and im glad i had it .
dont believe you would if it came to the point .
kidder she made the beds and at eleven oclock they sat down to strong tea and biscuits in the kitchen .
i declare i quite fancy it myself , i am that hungry .
said george lomax .
' then aren ' t like that , thank god ?
mcgillicuddy was still coming up the straight .
they were mostly in medchester , i think .
already the intense interest and excitement aroused by the murder of george alfred st .
was she in with her daughter , do you think ?
if it had all been finished and done for then .
on the brow of a hill in front of them there nestled a house of what house agents describe (but seldom truthfully) as old-world charm .
i think , i really do think that you ought to have a glass of sherry .
what the link was between his lordship and the girl well find out somehow or other .
blatt used to go sailing in that boat of his .
she apologized .
victorian .
obviously she didnt , said hardcastle , or you wouldnt have hesitated .
she likes having you to talk to in the evenings .
first idea was that the girl had pitched herself in .
in the morning he couldnt bring himself to admit he knew what had happened .
he said a few brief words to him ; then , together with poirot , he passed out on to the deck , closing the door behind him .
she managed it !
si , ma preferisco parlare in francese .
he is rather a pet !
how does he know ?
bridget retorted sharply : i dont tell myself fairy stories if thats what you mean !
cried the distracted nobleman .
he paused and then wrote : morleys office ?
working from information received that mrs .
i gather they were , rather .
yes , fever .
as the old man turned away , poirot said : the date on that wall calendar , has it remained like it is since the murder ?
thats it , is it , my fine fellow ?
i didnt believe in itnaturally , i didnt believe in it .
she said slowly : amy didnt want to leave wychwoodnot as things were .
not an authority on fianancial or business matters , his advice was technically vague , but its meaning unmistakable .
so i went .
the colonel was standing with his hands behind his back .
in some ways , in spite of his being so independent , he needs looking after like a child .
old friend of mine recommended him .
in that moment tuppence knew that the fish was hooked , and for the first time she felt a horror of her own money-loving spirit .
yet , if so , madness was a wonderful and amazing thing .
nobody knows how he died or where he was buried .
she added , was mrs .
she had kept on her suite .
satterthwaite pulled himself up short .
only about five months .
_num_ that is to say : mr .
it is suicide and security only that he is aiming at .
was he carrying anything in his hand ?
we eyed each other suspiciously , each trying to determine whether the other was farther on or had had a brain wave .
theres nothing one can get hold of .
then everything carrie louise broke off .
you and youryour friendsor are they relations ?
im all right now , said the girl .
supposing scherz had been helping himself to various small sums here and there , he could have covered himself , i suppose , by making good the money ?
wasnt there ?
said ericsson appreciatively , you are right .
the brother is as blind as a bat .
once id worked with horses in ireland .
yes , its my secret , jan replied .
she herself for perhaps the first time in her life , fell a victim to an overmastering passion .
i accompanied him , my heart beating wildly .
a few suggestions were made , then miss mullins looked at her watch and said she must hurry back .
perhaps because i am sorry , mademoiselle , for the things that i shall have to do so soon .
she had brought him there to show him the meaning of that one phrase : the young siegfried .
are you sure that the shoe has not simply been mislaid ?
jane shook her head impatiently .
the secret of all success is something quite simplebut it has to be thought of !
oh , david , davidyou oughtnt to have been saying those things to her .
lances willingness to take the various speculative or worthless shares off percivals hands .
he was too clever for us .
god knows what the trap wasi noticed that there was an empty chair at the table .
i want to make a fresh will .
i thought when she spoke that what she meant was that because of a love affair verity committed suicide .
why does it seem impossible ?
through it a shrewd , pale-blue eye watched poirot attentively .
restaricks car ?
and this boy must be over twenty .
oh , i dont know , said tuppence , we shall have to start all over again finding out as what , i suppose .
but now his face was a queer greyish colour and his eyes were closed .
the financier fell back in amazement , staring at him .
why did you smile when you said that ?
they might be to you .
welli cant say i noticed .
ah , thought poirot .
now then , inspectoryou are an inspector , i suppose ?
susan hesitated a moment before saying , i wanted to tell youthat i hope youll accept three months salary .
said poirot encouragingly .
is it a question , that ?
poirot murmured : i understand that it was decided to continue her education by sending her to school .
no , monsieur , there is only the communicating door into my room .
to miss marle ?
the man arrived at a run .
we get it .
he would make a bosh shot and hit him in the wrong place if he did .
sarah said slowly : i dont know .
ive got the key here .
its got a north light and plenty of room and a pad to sleep on , and a fourth share in the loo downstairsand what they call cooking facilities .
he had written to her breaking off the engagement .
now what was the talk about at dinner on tuesday night ?
and renisenb ?
one of thems missing .
turn to the left as you come out of the station , then take the first road on the right .
yes , the body had not been touched .
when you were doing this to help me .
it may have been my fancy , but i thought he hesitated before he replied .
you meansomethings happened to her ?
and you havent put a scale rod in .
go away home across the sea and dont come back to gipsys acre .
i enjoyed myself all the morning because of killing , but ive never got near enough to killing until now .
k .
look at him , maam , aint he a picture ?
he thinks he thinks i killed that man , and that i killed edna too .
she still had this quality though it was not now so easily apparent .
for instance , this gentleman here , mr .
serrocold is never alarmed is that what lies behind christian gulbrandsens death ?
perhaps the _num_ th .
i am happy to reassure you , said poirot .
i told your people last night i hadnt the least idea who the man was .
not directly , no .
goodnight , mademoiselle and may you sleep well .
hed come nowhere near establishing motiveand motive had to be established before there was a case to go to the public prosecutor .
she looked with great interest at their client .
never mind the flicks .
i didnt break it in a very interesting way , though .
an expression of utter astonishment appeared on macqueens face ; then it darkened .
now this girl had been distressed and unhappy lately , you say ?
you do not understand at all !
nothing , he murmured .
he seemed very far away , and curiously mundane .
there he gave certain instructions to george .
morning tea , mrs .
there was just one other little point that came up .
they have chosen evil , i think , much as miltons satan did : he wanted to be great , he wanted power , he wanted to be as high as god .
beside him sat tina looking rather like a small elegant black cat .
and then , said tuppence frowning , it is rather more difficult .
leidner prepares the scene for murder .
nothing now .
she likes living soft .
thats why i sent him a note the next morning .
do you mean bad things ?
so was max , and so , in his quieter way , was john .
she even glanced fearfully behind her to make sure that no one had watched what she had been doing .
oh , unquestionably , i should say .
the submarine plans i a note had been brought by special messenger .
com .
roger , began edith de haviland obstinately .
no , i never saw such a thing aboutand im sure if mrs .
donovan bailey abstracted bag some time during the evening .
he was top of his class in school and never did a naughty deed of any kind .
i will not waste the sympathy .
but where are you going to stay , then ?
the footman bore away the card and returned shortly to say that his grace was very sorry but he was extremely busy this morning .
always in liquor , harry were .
there were times when i envied emily , our little servant , who walked out whenever occasion offered with a large sailor to whom she was affianced .
were keeping it locked still .
oliver , one always wonders .
i avoided my own friends and acquaintances , yet the loneliness of my existence was insupportable .
its been his misfortune from his youth upwards .
poisoned .
she passed the other woman and came forward to where philip durrants chair had been brought up to the desk .
its my little plan , said mrs lacey gleefully .
bessie did not really know very much about her aunt .
so sad nowadays .
miss murgatroyd fairly twittered in alarm .
it was clever of you to guess .
what does he think the news will do to us ?
if you want me to go , mrs .
her mother died when she was only a child , you see .
sit down , monsieur poirot .
i tell you if i had my way stafford nye removed his mind to another subject while keeping up a flattering pretence as charles staggenham explained just what his way would be , which in any case was easily to be anticipated beforehand .
of course i shant ruin it , said ginger indignantly .
he turned to japp .
it seemed wildly unlikely that a man should be found murdered in her neat , austere housebut the unlikely happened more often than one would be disposed to believe .
hes all right , he said .
youre lookin well , you are .
before her eyes , very clearly , she saw spread out the panorama of green fields , rich and lush , and beyond , far away , an enchanted distance of pale rose and amethyst fading into the horizon , and cleaving the two , the pale silver blue of the nile .
the german and another were trying to force the door in .
the long lines of her body were pure greek .
they were the words of a much older woman and of one of a quite different type .
what should a woman want with these ?
poirot , but i think you are interested incharacter , shall we say ?
thats the only thing she can do for me now .
you always fuss over me , said tuppence .
but he was infatuated with her .
that awful butler .
ive never been very public spirited .
these mud walls are thick and the windows were closed .
why did she come here ?
lady veronica carlton-sandways turned up completely intoxicated !
rose smiled .
walter has always had wonderful self-control .
yet there must be a flaw .
the locks been oiled and the hinges .
but i was younger than she was .
very busy with his holly-hocksor is it chrysanthemums ?
rather melancholy speckled laurels , imperfectly trimmed , also interfered with the efforts of anyone to enter through the gate .
for gods sake , dont lets be anything but strictly businesslike !
lets go up and see .
i can tell you their names .
she didnt read books , but she enjoyed the sunday paper and she liked old magazines when her ladies gave them to her .
of course , a lot of people say that the murder of roger ackroyd is cheating ; but if they read it carefully they will see that they are wrong .
i talked to her for some time .
and if so , why should she , of her own accord , tell me about dropping the cyanide paper under the table ?
for me , there is , i think , only one line of action .
two large portraits hung on the wallsthe only personal touch .
lady angkatell turned to him in quick apology .
poirot said quietly : i am trying to do the best i can for diana maberly .
but anyway , we neednt worry about that .
suggested , mrs .
almost against his will , mr .
the repressed plain girl whom nobody notices .
but it is good air here , wonderful air .
i am sorry you do not think my little fiction well imagined .
perry , she said .
one step at a time .
and i feel almost ashamed not to have been in real trouble over them when he was such a knight-errant .
that hasnt been my way !
true , his question to annette had proved that he was personally unacquainted with jane finn , but he had never pretended otherwise .
frankie reflected for a minute or two .
you explain it will be best to freeze the gum .
listen to the conceit of the girl !
i she looked round .
folliat said : i will fetch another cup .
poirot had first to make a meticulous toilet .
his eyes were fixed on mr .
the shoes , sir .
moving briskly to the settee , he sat down and rubbed his hands together .
eccles is rather busy this morning .
men and women , some of them highly placed , some of them obscure , but all believing genuinely in the nazi aims and the nazi creed and desiring to substitute that sternly efficient creed for the muddled easygoing liberty of our democratic institutions .
the little man made a grandiloquent gesture .
here is bimbo .
i dont know about hurriedly .
i hope you wont , i said .
miss entwhistle sighed , snatched up a dressing gown and marched into the sitting room .
they must soon have done the round of all the available situations in england .
impossible to think of her as dead .
dont be so professional .
im sure that could be arranged , said mr .
awfully jolly hotel there , on a sort of island .
possibly they may not come until tomorrow night , but they know perfectly well that there are only two nights on which the radium will be there .
id better ring up the police .
he was just an old friend , nice and kind , and she wanted to get away from home where she wasnt happy .
oh , cried freda .
leidner sprang up and walked up and down in an agitated manner .
he did not believe his daughter .
one night he threatened her with a revolver .
but really i know very little about him .
but the natural man was there , as the chief inspector knew .
where was i ?
she listened intently , but heard only the sound of a car starting up and moving off .
one always does .
yes , said nick .
she saw through you all right !
about my coshing , i meanthe outsidersomebody perhaps who followed me here from market basing that day to see what i was up to .
lupton .
perhaps one of these days , youll remember my wordsknow her , you see .
poor girl , she must be feeling bad .
chah !
he paused , took another sip , and then nodded affirmatively .
its a kind of miracle how things get round .
the coroners face grew graver .

to begin with theres major burnaby and mr .
hed had far too much to drink , which was by no means unusual .
the murder of whom ?
he turned his head to look out of the window .
thats exactly what worries me so muchwhen im away from you .
his torch was directed on the front of the bed .
miss marple , her footsteps growing more painful every moment , arrived deep in thought at the other side of chelsea bridge and by then was so exhausted that she hailed the first taxi she saw with decision .
lee good night and left the room .
i hate anyone listening when im telephoning .
after all , i married you for better or for worse and aunt ada is decidedly the worse .
when rosalind was born , and i found a doctor and a nurse leaning over me , the doctor saying , well , youve got a daughter all right , and the nurse , more gushing , oh , what a lovely little daughter !
asked rosalie .
typically jane .
it was while he was sitting there .
did you make a certain remark to her about a scratch on her wrist ?
but elvira had hailed a taxi .
i would very much like to know what mischief pagett was up to in florence .
somebody murmured a sympathetic assent , but nobody spoke .
she saw you on the stairswaiting and listening .
did he say when he would be back ?
its got no doctors or couches , and you wont be shut up there , i can promise you .
it was not i .
her face showed nothing , but she made a slight grimace of distate as she said : i have never cared for that man .
yes , just by the door .
this theory was received in polite silence .
can i give you a hand in any way ?
doubtless le bon dieu knows what he does .
the furniture all of the period , each piece with signs of wear , but polished with loving care .
well , you see , sir , it was like this .
one of you remains in the dining room , talking and perhaps quarrelling aloud as though two people were there .
i asked , as carelessly as i could .
thats just what i dont want you to do .
i know something , said poirot .
and thats whats so terrible , isnt it ?
when i first saw you , mademoiselle , you were a looker-on at life .
tis all foolishness , thats what she said .
nobody knows a thing about it except you , padre .
dyson mentioned it .
she paused and then added in a soft voice : im very fond of nick .
whats the other thing ?
' ' he can get up .
thats how your friend got hold of it and , having a good head on him , he linked it up with the man climbing up the rope .
there seemed nonsense in that .
with base opportunism he had selected a moment when he felt tolerably certain that he had a good chance of getting away with his statement .
rosalind , unlike her mother , was not a child who could amuse herself by any exercise of imagination : she required something concrete .
house owned by a woman named coppins .
sixteen years ?
ii in the train on the way back to london , gwenda took out the shabby little black book and began to read .
a clear case of a young waster sponging on her .
the blinds had been drawn , and the whole room had a funereal aspect .
a great pet .
it means that before two equal deductions i chose the wrong one .
the other chambermaid isnt a very bright girl .
hercule poirot was disappointed with rhodes .
so , as you had been standing there , i thought it must be yours and came after you with it .
i had one .
not many about like her nowadays .
purvis is a shrewd man .
' mr carlile , turning to depart , murmured an apology as he almost collided with mrs vanderlyn .
i like men to have affairs , said egg .
and i was desperate .
inside the hostile courtroom , one man is all that stands between elinor and the gallows hercule poirot .
i should say there is probably little doubt that the woman who wrote to you actually did go back to france and is there now alive and well .
you were the only person who saw that photograph .
miss jacobs looked at him doubtfully .
at weston she must make herself noticed .
hm , i doubt it .
hercule poirot came to this door and knocked .
here i am actually trailing someone !
here was an unexpected check .
meredith blake sighed .
its got to be hastily thought of and hastily arranged .
they came to a halt and oblivious to the rapidly falling snow , entered into an excited discussion .
it is urgent that he should not tell anyonehe must not even hint .
i had to see you , she said .
all her papers had been in the small attach case .
' poirot raised his arms , his hands rested on his head just above each ear .
en vrit , it did not seem to make sense at first sight .
there was the splash of water , the gleam of the golden oranges , and innumerable scents and fragrances .
he drew himself upflung back his head .
its annoying that hes got such a good alibi .
her breath became faster .
i said i would like to very much and we made our way there .
half-done crossword puzzle cut from times .
that accursed girl and her beauty !
he had also listened to further talks to young men on the subject of myself by lord whitfield .
miss carnaby looked round her .
you dont do any work at all .
things tie up , you know .
i got cut in the arm but ed got a proper sort of stab .
and nigel said , i shant tell you , now , but im prepared to bet you that within three weeks i can produce samples of three deadly poisons here , and len bateson said hed bet him a fiver he couldnt do it .
abner rymer , widow of abner rymer , the button shank king , was removed yesterday to a private home for mental cases .
yessome of it was lovely .
the spectator , said edmund .
it had been the same feeling that she had experienced some hours earlier for humphrey bogart , and later for the duke of edinburgh .
the mistress went out in the afternoon to do some shopping and then she went to the pictures .
but surely it is not seven oclock now ?
the butler came forward bowing slightly .
he did me a great service once battle interrupted her .
i should have kept them locked up .
and suddenly bitterness came over her full tide !
they had passed in under the great domed arch and there had been nothing , absolutely nothing , to warn one of them that she would never come out through that door again alive .
i could not even feel frightened of himand yet i knew he was capable of having me murdered in cold blood if it struck him as necessary .
leonides .
he is incapable of making any woman happy .
i have to go .
a little limited in his ideas , perhaps , said miss marple .
a man who sits in his chair and pulls the strings .
on the other hand , in those days you had more leisurethere was leisure to think , to read , and to indulge in hobbies and pursuits .
but i cant see why because too late she got miss blacklocks signal to be quiet , and paused openmouthed .
and i think , too , they were really better suited than he and sylvia were .
a customs gentleman covered with gold braid hurried in our direction , put large chalk marks all over my baggage , said to me i wish you good voyageand departed to harry those who had not as yet adopted the cooks one pound procedure .
i see youve got your curtains drawn back already .
i am not afraid of my fathers anger .
it was gayer and much brighter .
henrietta got up .
boyd carringtons glance was quizzical .
sobek turned and strode angrily away .
it lacked the delicious softness of her own bed .
oh , you enjoyed it , did you ?
and what about your husband , my dear ?
i daresay you wont believe it .
by then , said the chief inspector , his tone changing slightly , we shall , i hope , be further on .
between them , he and joyce lifted the dog .
so we get a picture of this girl , continued the other .
satterthwaite shrugged his shoulders .
well , i suppose soyes , something of the kind .
he was also the author of a volume of reminiscences of eminent criminals .
' no , you did not come near the house again .
stay with you ?
but it is a delightful room , hastings insisted , sounding rather nettled .
it was not , midge thought , like anyone else sitting on your bed .
she would not take a bus , she decided .
he got up as sheila perenna came towards their table .
hed been devoted to her for years .
it is imperative that you should catch the _num_ .
damned confusing part of the world .
and he seems to be perfectly right in his head .
i expect she wants things for those unprepossessing children of hers , schools , and plates for their front teeth and music lessons .
my story is about the two english ladies .
geraldine began to laugh a deep malicious chuckle .
he was , so neil said , a good deal older than she was , but a thoroughly decent chap and quite reasonably well-off .
he turned his head to me .
at leastnot of this country .
miss blacklocks goes out to shut up the ducks and the hens sometimes in the evening , but she very often goes out through the kitchen door .
will you come this way , please .
well , hes given me the word .
cornelia looked round .
though charlotte and letitia had called each other by their full names , dora was the kind of person who always used abbreviations .
he urged me at great length , always , to go about a lot .
no , thats quite all right .
this key was one of them the other he stopped and then went on .
but michael wouldnt have tired of meneverneverneveroh !
purvis , might be a good thing , but poirot negatived the idea strongly .
the mill house , which is the property of sir eustace pedler , mp , is to be let unfurnished , and an order to view this property was found in the pocket of the man who was at first thought to have commited suicide by throwing himself on the live rail at hyde park corner tube station .
hester said : did they believe you ?
this is all very distressing , i know .
it doesnt suit me at all .
and yet i was convinced that he meant what he said .
the inspector responded with a baleful look at him , then shrugged , took off his coat , placed it on the wheelchair in the recess , and came back for his briefcase .
then she turned towards chief-inspector davy again .
and miss hinchcliffe said , you dont look it .
he had always had a sweet tooth .
what had i recently heard about a bungalow at bournemouth ?
i am not a scientist .
ive had enough of the fellow hanging about .
ill have a word with joe , said mrs .
the chauffeur had got down from his seat and joined the other man .
id saythis is just a private personal opinionthat she didnt expect what was going to happen .
ill find a way of getting out of here ?
the change in the germans air was audible as he replied with slight hesitation : we have received a message .
protheroeshe was sure of that .
legge would appear to be rather abnormal .
you trust her .
nobody could say he shows any enjoyment of my company .
we dont want to be taken in the rear .
i assure you , said frankie , that my crowd is a very mixed one .
there is a set of footprints going and returning .
he made his way cheerfully out of the tea-shop , thinking to himself as he did so : not too bad .
how long has she been here ?
paperbacks , cash sales department , box _num_ , douglas , isle of man .
how much do the people who are coming know ?
tommy did not reply .
so different from the big noisy indifferent town .
this was uninteresting to me except as a provider of raspberries and green apples , both of which i ate in large quantities .
i am most anxious to see something of dartmoor , the weather is good .
you , mon colonel , will sit here behind this table in an official position .
lippincott , rather dryly .
the children ?
i am glad he is dead !
henrietta said to gerda : what fun actresses are .
the lips were drawn back from the bloodless gums in something that looked like a snarl .
hes retired , and living in bournemouth .
if theres anything i can do dont think so , thank you , nurse .
i believe black bess does , too , but she wouldnt let on .
what about the other one ?
theyre like that !
wallys soft , faintly drawling voice held no special insinuation and yet gina flinched a little .
but above , the stars were peaceful .
yet , since she was restless and anxious to escape from her thoughts she put on her hat straight away , and took a convenient bus to the address given in the advertisement .
' poirot raised his eyebrows , but did not reply .
the doctor sprang up with a roar .
i couldnt really tell , my dear .
well , it must have been on my list , sir , but i didnt notice it special , so to speak .
he looked into carriage after carriage .
i daresay he could pass off a good enough job and he was probably quite cocksure that it would go through .
that is now unnecessary , i said coldly .
but when agatha showed it to her agent , he advised her not to bother submitting it to any theatre as , in his opinion , it was not good enough to be staged .
damned hard up .
my dear young man , said poirot , you must realise that there are rumours going about , and rumours are almost always about the same persona husband .
please listen carefully now to what i have to say .
constantine , had hurried out of the restaurant car and along the corridor of the stamboul coach towards mrs .
and he thought of his other picturescolour , romance , sir rufus herschman .
' suggested japp , who had been vatching him closely .
emma said something about it one day .
his mouth just opened when he saw me .
you see what it means , the inspector urged .
youre a personor so ive found in my experiencewith a skin too fewa person who is plagued the whole time with diffidence .
then , would you be so good as to sit there once again ?
harter smiled affectionately at him but did not answer .
well , there used to be a lot of stories about it .
no good giving a mingy salary to a man and expecting to get one whos any goodyouve got to have someone whos the tops .
all this began with a rucksack .
she spoke in english but her voice was foreign , a rich low voice very seductive in quality .
that might be important or notdepends on his financial position .
i select each passenger in turn , consider their evidence and say to myself , if so and so is lying , on what point are they lying and what is the reason for the lie ?
she was anything but vivacious now .
im just ever so grateful , thats all .
she tossed off her little vad cap , and i admired the great loose waves of her auburn hair , and the smallness and whiteness of the hand she held out to claim her tea .
have you got a secret enemy , father ?
had there been , as mr .
moira was listening attentively , but clearly the mention of marchbolt meant nothing to her .
everyone is a little mad .
so lucky i was able to let you in .
she called to the blonde : dorothy ?
and there is a kind of roly-poly of a cobweb hanging down over your left ear which is most attractive .
what a person really is , is only apparent when the test comesthat is , the moment when you stand or fall on your own feet .
she knocked and the voice of miss sally finch bade her enter .
i shall have to ask a lot of questions .
a doctor , as you should know , mademoiselle , is usually fairly careful in making his statements .
and he had deliberately lied about it .
a skilled and experienced waiter .
he paused and then said thoughtfully : it might be that the other one killed her .
it was a very simple little murder , suggested by bob and his habit of leaving the ball at the top of the stairs .
the one you said you havent seen for about fifty or sixty years ?
theresa found her voice .
really , staffy , what an extraordinary idea !
it is very easy for anyone to have a a bust of any size and dimension .
looked back with an expression on her face that i can only describe as one of poignant anxietya kind of anguished uncertainty that imprinted itself on my brain .
well , i could do with some .
she paused and stephen said unwillingly : well , i daresay that may be true enoughshe looks far from well .
every moment may be needed .
and then when the police came round and started asking questions , he tried to bash her on the head , so that she shouldnt be able to give him away not a nice young manbut very good-looking .
neither he nor mr petherick could do so .
hallowhats loraine flying up the stairs for as though shes got a mad bull after her ?
were you all together ?
what are you driving at ?
his plans were already made as to what to do with these two days .
we had the marchioness of barlowe in yesterday .
cornelia was the prey of conflicting emotions .
i think you really will enjoy it .
sickness , old age , children run over , sometimes even more dreadful things .
suddenly the millionaires self-control broke down , and he cried fiercely and angrily : who are you ?
it was an ordinary round tin cylinder , such as films are packed in for the tropics .
some men are .
oh , yes , said raymond .
yes , it is sixteen years since the events of which we are to speak , but let me first tell you why we are here .
and i said to adele : whatever have you been doing there ?
lived ?
wait a minuteyes , i do .
she may not have told him .
then she had left the room .
thats the worst of you .
we do not stir out this morning .
nobody in their senses , he thought , could christen a child merlina .
her mother was a school teacher and her father a bank clerk .
how id love to have a go at your cottage , said lucy .
would i think it terrible of him if he went ?
nine m .
her attention was still on her ring ; her head on one side , she watched the green fire in its depths as her hand moved .
i suppose it put it into my mind , said mr .
poirot and i had breakfast served in our sitting room .
_num_ a year and ashfield was all i could count upon for the future .
he murmured softly : may _num_ st may _num_ st and today , june _num_ th , i receive her letter .
i noted that the orion sailed on saturday , and having obtained the name of the steward i sent him a wireless message asking a certain question .
lancasters picture but the two things dont tie up together anyway , said tommy .
mcginty herself .
he bent down and ran his fingers over the number plate delicately , then nodded approval .
perhaps , who knows , serious annoyance to innocent persons .
the inspector busied himself with the telephone , then turned to us with a grin .
not with me , you wont live happily ever after , said julia .
and there i was , wondering why she hadnt turned up as usual .
the suggestion was infamous !
tell them the truth .
how stupid i am !
he was absorbed in his work , deeply satisfied with the conditions provided for him , but his inquiring gallic intellect led him to speculate and ponder on the media in which he found himself .
i wouldnt have waited .
im sure it is all a very difficult problem , said miss marple .
she told me this morning that i was to be as rude as i liked whilst i was here .
an idea which had already taken form in his mind was strengthened .
xii it was just after dawn when hercule poirot awoke on the following morning .
most improbable , said gwenda .
id never dreamed of such a thing .
you said her death was importantthat it meant something .
she added : what about horbury ?
ingles left at the same time as we did .
he was an extremely well-read man , and a man of considerable intellect .
merton said uncertainly : i dont know , im surewhat i ought to do !
bridget chanted immediately , colins got the pig !
she doesnt admit it , but i dont think shes in the best of health , so please be gentle with her .
i wouldnt have missed it for anything .
that would put her on her guard .
no , i dont , said sarah bluntly .
one young man said to me , with the air of finding me thoroughly unreasonable : well , youre separated from your husband , and i gather probably divorcing him , so what else can you expect ?
mcgintys been done in , he said .
oh , it is of miss grey you speak ?
my part consisted of saying yes at varying intervals .
miss percehouse has a nephew who occasionally comes down to see her , she went on , and indeed hes staying with her at the present time .
there was reproach in poirots voice .
i mean the people as a whole .
her mouse-brown hair was unflecked with grey and her steady hazel eyes set in the rather podgy face shone out like beacons of kindliness .
shed try to bluff it out , he supposed , but she couldnt put it over on him .
you are so fond of saying , we know , hastings .
miss marple looked beamingly after them .
and midge , her voice unsteady : im very sorry , madam .
your husband is quite certain about it ?
not at all superstitious .
a great emerald , cool and green and full of hidden fire .
it was all in that battered set of duplicate childrens books .
bessner was about to break out , but a peremptory gesture from race silenced him .
no one could touch you .
egg took him by the arm again and shook him violently .
tanios monopolized the conversation at the dinner table most of the time .
yahmose looks sick and tired and hunted .
she seized the book from tuppence and replaced it in the line , then tugged out an identical book from the other end of the shelf , announcing with a beaming smile : k-k-klean nitice jackorner !
such a beautiful letter of condolence , really i think you would feel most touched by it .
lord laid a hand on elinors arm and drew her gently away out of the room .
i take my leave .
and suddenly i began to wonder too and then a rather comic idea occurred to me and i jotted it downand then i worked up rather a good little scene all very obvious stuff .
its deadly serious .
you see , mademoiselle , he said gently , you also have your intuitions .
' asked donovan curiously .
i had a certain standing .
its so terribly lucky to be born thick-skinned .
the study was a comfortable apartment .
it would not be easy to secure the acquittal of jack renauld by anything short of the truth .
she said at once that she didnt want to continue being sinister and melodramatic , that she had done a good many films lately in which she had been the wicked lady .
i shall stick to the old ship , i think , though its awfully good of hersheimmer .
i found that rather alarming , and wondered what occasioned it .
i happen to know , said fournier , that the lady in question has been losing very heavily at the baccarat table at le pinet .
there were a few old letters and bills thrust in amongst a bulging drawer of underclothes .
with poirot away , i was uncertain how to act .
my word , hes a good guard dog , isnt he ?
the other , the same size , but labelled nailex cardinal , was nearly full .
every one was in better spirits .
i mean that imhotep is a ka-priesta mortuary priestall his lands , all his cattle , his timber , his flax , his barley , are the endowment of a tomb .
she slipped a small soft hand into mine .
it must be in the car .
its quite true , said cornelia .
mr cope had with him quite an interesting article on petra and the nabateans .
he shivered suddenly .
philip blake frowned .
at low tide it was quite near ; at high tide it was quite a good swim , and you had it more or less to yourself .
yes in fact , theres a small recess , but how you knew about it you havent been to the place , have you , monsieur poirot ?
miss marple thought .
ah , he is a master , mr .
and now suddenly you come down the hill in your car and there it is , said the woman .
yes , poor old bean .
and unless i am mistaken some devonshire thesigers also .
because , you see , this business im going up to town aboutwell , actually it is to scotland yard im going .
in this case , it was definitely better not .
it was , of course , only a vague possibility , but it was there at the back of our minds , a sort of outside chance that might possibly come true .
if id had a proper father they wouldnt have gone on like that .
then , taking you as the person who knew her best , why do you think she asked that question as she did ?
and the way she looks at you , as though you werent there but somebody else wasim expressing it badly but it is so hard to convey the impression i mean .
the dear boy insisted on paying all my expenses .
she held out her glass to touch his .
it isnt so easy to do what youre urging me to do , he said .
hercule poirot has solved his last case .
you interest me , said charlotte .
we need detain mademoiselle no longer , i think , he suggested .
the gipsies used to camp here a lot when i was a boy , he said .
in the morning well do what the french call reconstruct the crimeyes , lady eileen , what is it ?
she was looking unusually striking in a dress of gold tissue with an underlying note of green .
presently a young man came to miss marple .
hastings has explained to you that we are anxious for no publicity ?
i remember reading the paragraph in the paper saying an exhumation order had been granted .
as well hang for a real crime as a fictitious one .
on the other hand every piece of furniture he ever bought is a gem .
they were neither dazed nor wandering .
i am asking you something .
the fireman climbed down from the engine .
ill drive you home , said sir charles .
bantry bore her friend triumphantly across the library to the big old-fashioned fireplace .
it could be he reflected a minute that it may take a great deal of the evening and that it will all be excessively foolish .
of course , the darlings exaggerate it all a good deal and make it all sound as though it had been frightfully important .
bad luck for that young couple , i must say .
he bowed , shook hands , indicated a chair .
ill meet you at the bridge at eight thirty .
im sure it wouldnt be loud enough to wake anybody up .
he said slowly : she wouldnt take it like that if it were .
and why , may i ask , should you ring me about this distressing occurrence ?
a mighty fine hotel it is , too .
anyway , women who earn their living as companions are usually fools .
mary looked at her inquiringly .
all the same it seems hardly crediblewell , we shall see .
i suppose i deserve that .
lucas .
it seemed that during his treatment in hospital , the wound had become infectedcarelessness of a native dresser .
but she has to put up with me for that nincompoop alfreds sake .
but whats all this about an appointment with me ?
i am afraid that i must insist .
but do you realize how formidable it is ?
i arranged it all so carefully too , sending him off to florence , telling the hotel i was going over to nice for one night or possibly two .
of course , french children are allowed to sit up far too late .
speech is the deadliest of revealers .
he had crossed the rubicon .
we dont want to make any mistake .
i was inside an automobile , well wrapped up and from the window i saw you .
if he suspected that she knew .
later , perhaps , we might have some bridge ?
caroline .
she sank slowly to her knees , her arms spread wide , her face vacant and stupid .
his age might have been anything from thirty-five to forty-five .
angela warren waved an impatient hand .
the blow would produce unconsciousness and death would follow very shortly .
no , i cannot .
but as soon as mrs .
very fond of seed cake herself and she used to bake seed cakes for people and take them to them , and she never troubled to find out whether they liked seed cake or not .
not at all , said the examining magistrate soothingly .
the girl nodded , tears coming once more into her eyes .
dear miss marple , by the time you read this i shall be dead and also buried .
oliver believedwere not really of high-class material .
all the usual city gambits .
things are going badly in this country .
i was completely cleaned out .
the fact of forgery .
then he opened the swedish ladys and uttered an exclamation of satisfaction .
then she looked at her watch .
redding was waiting for me in the study .
owen must be a very different sort of gentleman .
after all , it wasnt a very amusing life for a girl .
and its more likely to have been a woman than a man i dont see that at all .
my dear reggies letters were exactly like reggie talking , which was nice and reassuring .
as we ran across the street to the spot where i had parked the car , hermia remarked unjustly that whenever one went to the old vic it always rained .
of the four suspects mrs .
because he was the sort of dago who needed kicking badly .
but if i hadher voice changed and softenedid never have met lance .
i remember the man now perfectlytall , well-drilled fellow .
carol shook her head doubtfully .
i am rich .
and amazement held him , sheer bewildered amazement .
for students , the rates are on the high side .
i have seen , i think , all that there is to be seen here .
her people are tenants on the estate , and her mother , mrs .
he made a gesture of dismissal .
marcus kent has a low mind .
im just passing through , as a matter of fact .
but it was too late for any doctor .
mary aldin said : you mean that lady tressilians death was the culmination of a long train of circumstances ?
she added dreamily , i wouldnt put it past her to have thought up a murder .
shoved her knife into her pretty thoroughly , i should imagine !
theyre keeping all the reporters out .
if he had been asked he would have admitted to a preference for asian flu or even an outbreak of bubonic plague .
small station , strangers noticeable .
you see im frightfully badly off , and this little bit of journalistic work will make all the difference .
it wouldnt mean anything .
he was about to propose a bitter lemon , ginger ale , or orangeade , but elvira forestalled him .
im a tiresome old woman , difficult to satisfy !
so thats your answer , said alistair blunt .
we used to go up there occasionally but not very often .
very unpleasant , said alice .
mary opened the door and murmured : tea is just coming in , mrs .
gerda was delighted .
restarick , as to what the matter might be on which in this letter you apparently want to engage me ?
like many high-spirited women , sarah believed herself to admire strength .
it was , of course , possible that there might be nothing to do mr .
really before shed begun her career .
i see the point , said tommy .
i received a letter with a signature that was not very easy to read .
if only it could have been someone from outsidebut i dont see how it can .
i believe so , sir .
she went across to the holbein portrait , touched a spring concealed somewhere at the side of it , and immediately , with a creaking noise , a section of the panelling swung inwards , revealing a dark opening .
what seemed so funny , she said , was that she did it on purpose .
help yourself .
and yet you liked tanios , did you not ?
i think she did speak the truth .
the pale horse isnt a pub , said rhoda .
oh , it does .
i have always been so suretoo sure .
i see , said freda .
a minute or two afterwards the door of the tower room opened , and charles leverson came out .
we communicated with sir arthur here .
there was a small remnant of desiccated tongue .
find out what crime exactly (if any , that is to sayafter all , shaitana may have been talking through his hat to make an impression on m .
everything seemed vaguely disquieting .
we shall perhaps meet again later in the day .
they got through to the police station quite easily , but found a good deal of difficulty in explaining matters .
you think its possible that she is dead ?
poirot looked at him inquiringly .
fool !
all she had to do was to avoid leaving fingerprints and the slightest knowledge of detection fiction would teach her that .
when you think of people , it is in the image you have made of them for yourself .
it was one of the things she thought about .
the mcnaughten rules are narrow and unsatisfactory .
but for the disturbing war news , the tragedy would probably have been given much greater space in the papers than it was .
perhaps you do not know that .
wychwood-under-ashe has got rather a reputation that way .
but not very well , she added .
one almost felt that hercule poirot himself had been an eyewitness of the scene .
im a theorist , too .
she was sweetadorably sweet in her grief .
all the thousands of ordinary people on the earth , minding their own business , and tilling the earth , and making pots and bringing up families and laughing and crying , and getting up in the morning and going to bed at night .
folliat , that shes quite all right .
lovely red ones , she added .
i suppose it cant have been well ?
philip asked me sharply .
the blacksmiths wife .
in case sheila is delayed a long time .
cant you understand a man who could hardly speak trying to drag that word out ?
poirot drew me back a little .
said marcus joyfully .
with this door unobtrusively ajar , mr .
i can get you in there as a friend of mine , where quite possibly you might have the door shut in your face any other way .
fanthorp considered .
the genial kindly doctor was idolized by everyone in the place , but it seems most probable on the evidence that it was the doctor who was responsible for mary jordans death , though at the time no one would have believed it .
but if he does that it means i want shielding , doesnt it ?
) yes , on the whole i inclined to the theory of buried treasure .
hes busy now going about and saying he didnt really do it .
im afraid its out of the question .
for a moment dianas face dropped its mask of gaiety and looked an agonized question .
with a nod colonel race indicated the silent figure in the chair .
he observed the fall on the others face .
harrison was sitting in a chair by the table .
were dealing , remember , with a madman .
she talked a lot of nonsense this afternoon .
shes the one whos throwing her weight about , i suppose .
no it wasnt , said mrs .
well , who shall we consider nextjackson ?
a long narrow foot with rather a peculiar type of shoe .
must i read this , poirot ?
you cannot help us there , my child ?
i seem to remember reading about it .
well , shut it then , laughed the woman .
the saloon was dotted with little tables .
now , in this sudden emergency , the constraint passed , they talked together naturally enough .
i had no idea what was the matter .
bridget looked doubtful .
lombards eyebrows rose .
if celia austin knew that .
otherwise i shouldnt be here .
for a moment a judgment showed in themhad there been any one to read it .
this time it was a burning tide .
then , with a smile , she nodded a farewell and went back into the house .
the only question he did want to ask her could wait .
i want you to let me call him into investigate this matter .
lutz said : and why was he killed ?
at a quarter to ten he was at a public-house a mile from here .
i found youd been married six months .
his favourite was a spanish dancer , once world famed for her beauty , who hid herself here so that the world should never know that she was no longer beautiful .
you can put it in the eyes , yes , but if you swallow a teaspoonful it makes you ill .
as a matter of fact i did think .
perhaps she wasnt sure at first , then perhaps she began to suspect her husband , and then perhaps she got to be quite sure .
know something about it , old horse ?
so young too .
i must confess that that side of it amused me .
peter lord smiled .
nonsense , charles .
ive examined the car , sir , he replied .
it is very ungrateful .
sometimes i think lucy really is a bit touched , said midge as she and edward strolled away from the house and up towards the woods .
yes , she liked him very much .
oh , i suppose ken told you .
you cant have human beings judging other human beings and taking the law into their own hands .
you think so , mon ami ?
oh , i know it sounds absurd .
moneys always welcome , said mr ryder .
her eyes rested on bridget , who was frowning down at the carpet .
it is a hypothesis .
he demanded fretfully .
only the sun , majestic in power , shining overheadonly the slim streak of pale silver that was the nile in this morning lightonly these were eternal and enduring .
its many a year now since folks lived in it and called it the towers .
she smiled and suggested : would it be worth trying telephonic communication with mr .
he called .
king victor has never taken a life , the frenchman reminded him .
major somervell wants to get in as soon as possible .
he passed the paper across to poirot and rose .
i believe you can get pearl buttons quite cheaply at woolworths .
poirot took her hand in both of his .
carey and mrs .
youve no hints ?
there was no case of necessary injections or anything of that kind .
i should have been merely recovering my own property .
entwhistle , can be very unreliable sometimes .
entwhistle sighed .
there always will be .
japp whispered to norman : fancies himself , doesnt he ?
tell me , he ordered .
you know .
the fact that there were not enough mouths to devour twelve fillets of sole , not even counting a couple in the kitchen , never appeared to enter her head .
because for the last two months ive been making a sentimental idiot of myself over jane !
for after all , thats all a nuns dress is .
i like a high one myself .
indeed we dont .
so long as we thought it was jacko hester said and broke off .
said simon under his breath .
hastings , you will enjoy this , poirot remarked , passing the letter to his friend .
ah , dieu , mon estomac !
not very interesting , i suppose ?
and marlene did enjoy the idea of being the body .
but the girl wasreallywell , quite insolent and said that at any rate she hoped that in her next place she wouldnt be in the kind of house where people got bumped offa dreadful common expression , acquired at the cinema , i believe , and ludicrously inappropriate since poor dear rosemary took her own lifethough not at the time responsible for her actions as the coroner very rightly pointed outand that dreadful expression refers , i believe , to gangsters executing each other with tommy guns .
you see , if richard had had his own way , he would have sent jan to an institution .
i will help you to understand , mr .
but who knows ?
the easiest way is to put it upside down .
ill go somewhere where he cant find me .
_num_ tri ' qqe at rhodes chafi j r l _num_ 	p ' g lb , ste ' i ' 	s carefully dressed in a andified fashion in i : .
they were received at the door by a white-headed butler whose demeanour was perfect .
i dont admire her .
bad habit , sleeping draughts .
gilliatts face .
miss brewster remarked : m .
i sent her a large cheque .
one of those grim females with temperance on the brain .
sit down , madame .
a good slice off the joint never did anyone any harm .
please sir , if i could have a word with you .
one had to face the fact : st .
died soon after she went abroad .
so why should mrs .
his widow carried on the shop and enlarged it in an ambitious way .
oh well , brown-hailsham , hailsham-brown , she continued .
both were women of forty odd .
married some dago who was over at the university .
and the manthat man that you nearly killed yes ?
stillingfleet murmured , thats so of course .
sir george got up and went out .
shes got all the drive and the initiative and the political acumen .
the smooth white globules rolled all over the room .
often he did that as a child .
the door of the dining-room opened and sir george came across the hall and up the stairs .
well , everyone his own hobby .
have you ever come across a race of people that used snake venom as an arrow poison ?
spanish beauties have hot tempers , but i dont see that attractive creature slitting the old mans neck in cold blood , especially as from what has come out she had every reason to keep him aliveat any rate until he had signed a new will .
better not , he thought .
he took her back to america in haste .
commented caroline .
it was a revolver .
we cannot be sure .
he murmured : such a frail shrunken old manand yetall this .
poirot , and it isnt very pleasant for me .
that suicide business , you see , frightened poison pen .
a young woman in a nylon overall said : mr .
no , no , said sir charles .
not in the least , said victoria .
i should have thought myself that it would not have been a bad plan , observed knighton .
she said : george gives me lots of things .
your edward wasnt really quite so clever as he thought himself , you know .
you , renisenb , were not a rival .
clearly a retired hairdresser .
dont you let it worry you , my dear .
one house had steps in front of it which , if you took one more , would land you in the river on a dark night .
well , thats all .
she said : look at me .
i will not go into long-winded discussions , i will just state the bare facts .
her death was not unexpected but it was sudden .
what did you say , fred ?
it had a wide carriagedrive sweeping round the block with neatly spaced flower beds at strategic positions in the grass .
in the six-wheeler , mr .
why wouldnt you speak to me when i said hallo ?
and so on with the comedy .
but i am rather worried sometimes about anthea .
i am talking of your daughter .
with megan ?
on the sideboard were half a score of heavy silver dishes , ingeniously kept hot by patent arrangements .
i shall know better where we are then .
caux ?
they hadnt seemed fatuous at the time , but to have them hashed up in cold blood !
iisure youre all right ?
the simplicity of the solution rather took him aback .
such a comfort having her here .
so in between your picking the flowers and your coming to get the rosebud someone must have smoothed over the bed .
we all rot her about that ghost .
or rather the son and the son-in-law .
id have sent him to the devil .
there was no sex complexno particular age complex , and that seemed to me to be a very curious fact .
van stuyvesant , her stepmother , was away from home , which i may say was a quite frequent occurrence .
after all , one must do things by oneself sometime , mustnt one ?
parker pyne began to talk .
bridget said slowly : its a little awkward .
oh yes , sir , always .
so , for _num_ , i built on a small , square , mud-brick room , and it was there that i began writing this book .
what is it , mon ami ?
if he had , i might have loved him in return .
the charwoman .
she said : goodbye , m .
a thing like this cant be hushed up , said charles vyse .
presently he did hear a low murmur of voices and drew a breath of relief .
to me , one of the most interesting of my cases .
safely in the enemys camp .
i guess ill sue the hotel for this .
i wish id wrung her neck !
ill take her with me and you can wait and bring her cases up .
ah well , sit down , sit down .
twenty ive brought you a cup of strong soup , carrie louise , said miss marple .
no , nothing .
youll enjoy that .
after a moments cogitation , he left the car and struck up the side of the hill .
did she notice anything odd about his manner ?
so much for that story then , said bland .
its all very familiar .
cried poirot irritably .
she hadnt thought of those days for years .
did he give you any indication of the line you were to take ?
i feel then that i could have done it myself .
as for you , renisenb , you would do well to be on my side , do you hear ?
thank goodness ive found you both !
nicoletis , i mean .
i just cant stand people who are hearty .
she can be her age anytime shes allowed to be , i said , still slightly angry .
poirot left the house , glad that scorched pudding and near-penicillin were not to be his portion today .
i bade her farewell tearfully .
granted , fashion queen , but the girl ruby miss marple said : ruby , of course , wasntwell , to put it bluntlyruby wasnt a lady .
du tout , du tout .
ill say thats so !
and you walked up and down the terrace , how many times ?
i was facing the courtyard .
any ideas on that ?
she was prejudiced and obstinate but , after all , why not ?
raymond said gaily : jeffs blushing .
poirot , an old friend of mine .
its a gigantic conspiracy .
it might have been anywhere .
save him !
miss marle found them for me .
i thought his valet would find an empty bottle and throw it away without question .
i shall know by then if what i have imaginedimagined only , you comprehendis correct .
double sin i had called in at my friend poirots rooms to find him sadly overworked .
because i looked like her .
a waiter , flying down the swinging car , deposited cups of soup before them as if by a miracle .
my journeydid you come the same way ?
she got up and passing her sister , she ran out of the room .
killed immediatelythey didnt find her until the next day .
back in the council chamber , the detective strode at once to the middle window .
these actors !
i took some of the china menus along , for one thing .
he cant want his mother .
and a little humpbacked bridge and the pink walls of the house , the two poplar trees , more than two .
a lunatic asylum .
no delicate matters to investigate for royalty ?
and elephants , too , for that matter .
esa said sharply : you have a purpose in remaining here .
i turned on her angrily and she slunk away murmuring she hadnt meant anything , only it seemed odd like , didnt it , happening a second time .
sugden said : then you think someone is lying ?
actual brews have been thrown out by now , of course , but theres one point .
why , mrs .
edward paled slightly .
first of all those awful , awful labour people .
did you go into the house ?
she had her dear and affectionate nephew who , if she was in straits for money of any kind , if she needed repairs to her house or a visit to a specialist or special treats , dear raymond would always provide them .
it suddenly occurred to me that if i didnt like the way other people had adapted my books , i should have a shot at adapting them myself it seemed to me that the adaptations of my books to the stage failed mainly because they stuck far too closely to the original book .
shouldnt have worried about them if they had been !
he stared for some time at the two questions he had written .
in the press and privately .
someones taken ill , said miss zielinsky shortly .
poirot in his square chair was drinking a glass of sirop de cassis .
i am glad to hear you enjoyed it , sir , she said graciously .
and then she was in the house when the shot was fired she might have done it herself .
im inspector reeves .
emma was sitting up in bed , a soft pink shawl was round her shoulders and brought out the faint rose-pink of her cheeks .
it was costly and unusual .
well , that may be so , said colonel melchett .
if theyd been able to get hold of them it would have made a big difference .
well , we havent had very much time yet .
a boy of fifteen , a girl of fourteen , and the boy of twelve who died .
what about a walk this afternoon ?
he said , and his voice sounded honestly bewildered : i havent the faintest idea !
and the same applies to renisenb .
make the coffee before you go , and leave it by me in the percolator ready to switch on .
there is no political situation involved in this .
again simon looked across from the bridge table .
and when the police got on his track he disappeared , is that it ?
ill need to get a clear statement of exactly what occurred from you all .
its cold today .
all three of them .
remember this , the third warning will come by the hand of the destroyer she made a sign , and the car whirled away rapidly .
cover her face mine eyes dazzle she died young that might have been me if miss marple hadnt been there .
the wait was not a long one , but it seemed to the passengers as though half an hour at least had passed before an erect soldierly figure in plain clothes , accompanied by a uniformed policeman , came hurriedly across the aerodrome and climbed into the plane by the door that mitchell held open .
east wind passed , and we started a new hand in silence .
naomi grinned .
when ay think of the noisy gaping crowds .
tanios , because she had nothing to fear from you , my dear bella .
you couldnt know about it , because nobody has told you what it was heather badcock actually said .
i should say that possibly you were right .
shrivenham looked nervously apprehensive .
edna hasnt got any sense , and her dad , he put a stop to it .
of course theyd heard that mrs .
parker pyne was reminded of the consuls saying : you can see she is somebody , if you know what i mean .
several reasons .
wasnt the old cat in a rage when she found out ?
cornelia shook her head .
hed be a lascar really , and captain trevelyan would have thrown his favourite brother overboard in a mutinysomething like that .
knows latin and greek , i believe .
she used to when she was younger .
they entered the open door of the balmoral court .
well , really , it ' s very difficult to say .
i hope so , too , said mrs .
she paused again , a piece of toast in her hand , and looked up as albert entered the room .
well find out just exactly what sort of a jam victors in .
my god , satterthwaite , listen to this : sir bartholomew strange .
must you go , m .
shes a very sharp old lady .
parker pyne left for persia after a stop in baghdad .
of course he might take the nametheres not a lytcham roche left .
the duke , remember , was in paris or was supposed to be in paris at the time of the crime .
the original dagger was stolen by dulcie duveen and thrown into the seasince , as she thought , it belonged to her sister .
still , nobody cares to hear an old mans criticisms , so there we are .
it had all hinged on that .
he turned suddenly to poirot .
drake (owner of house) mrs .
youre mr sellons partner , she said .
from the window of her sitting room farther along , the housekeepers head appeared .
now , dont be nasty .
that , i am sure , is not applicable to the chase you have been conducting .
he hurried off down the corridor .
i dont know what bche-de-mer is , i have never known , i probably never shall know .
every minute taking her farther and farther away .
they travelled on the tubular railway , they rode horses , they did gardening , they also played a great deal of croquet .
nothing to work your grey cells over this time .
it was in my mind that we might all three engage in conversation .
percival when he was at home) .
here he stopped and surveyed the scene .
but that , monsieur , is not his real name .
a maid admitted us and took us into the drawing-room , then went in search of mrs oglander .
bradley arrested and tried for murder .
yes , it was , indeed .
what was the point of it ?
she lay there shivering , her heart pounding , her eyes staring at the ceiling .
it wasnt fitted up for smuggling if thats what you mean .
but whowhich one ?
i was thrilled by that idea .
i was about to shut the door behind mebut found an unexpected resistance .
the other woman was watching her .
lloyd cleared his throat .
all platonic , mind you , too .
you think they were not casual ?
why should he attach himself otherwise to an insignificant stranger ?
dont go on talking in riddles .
shes never worked or lifted a finger .
then , if i may ask , why did you think ?
it cannot be a fake .
sometimes i feel that we never were any use .
perhaps i am a little like my grandson , young mathew , at two years old , coming down the stairs and reassuring himself by saying : this is mathew coming downstairs !

i say , you look awfully done up .

he smiled , noting the astonished expression on the faces of the others .
she seemed such a curious mixture of child and woman .
still , she had complained of the cold .
the little morning room ?

miss pebmarsh who could have killed him before she went out at _num_ : _num_ or thereabouts and miss webb who could have arranged to meet him there , and killed him before rushing from the house and giving the alarm .

hilary strolled through the gardens , descending from terrace to terrace .
it is permitted , he asked , looking round and beaming , that i congratulate the cook on this marvellous meal that i have just eaten ?

the cigarette box of australian fiddlebacka present from brian pearson possibly .
bryan martin was very deeply in love with your mistress .
the y .
something is sticking out of his pocket .
but as far as that goes i have already thoughtpoirot obviously thinks this english girl is mixed up in the matter .

said thomas , with slight interest .
it had still three days to run .
i asked geronimo about the bulbs and he said theyd been taken out .

my dear lynn !
well , i dont see what you could have clearer than that .
it is pretty , that !
yes , ill say it , i did have a grudge against the lady , and i felt bitter about it when i saw her on this boat , all dressed up in pearls and diamonds and lording it all over the place , with never a thought that shed broken up a mans life for him !
well , it wasnt the next weekend .
i thought perhaps youd lost your way , said the friendly witch .
i was no longer studying music seriously .
the wedding took place at eleven in the morning , and we had the wedding breakfast at ashfield .
' how shall i say it ?
and all the time , underneath , i was growing more and more determined .
she had actually done such a thing once or twice before .
i think he had to go to london for some conference .
fanes brow .
i do not understand myself , said poirot .
now then , you two , get on with it .
or had she merely said so for some reason of her own ?
he changed the hiding place .
all i can say is that if im right the person in question is a very cool customera very cool customer indeed .
she murmured faintly , i dont ecoutez , madame , i do not ask you to give away your secrets .
one thing more , said carbury .
hes a-waiting downstairs .
not at all , sir , said gladys .
i looked again at the pile of luggage .
it is only a few questions that i ask about a domestic matter .

but really , i do feel that a man who can get into a rage over such a trifle is , well , dangerous .
with a deft gesture , he rearranged it .
if i might lie down upstairs .
marshall considered for a moment or two , then he said quietly : no , i think that idea is absurd .
its a bit awkward , he said .
the very thought of her name , uttered silently , hurt him .
he began to talk to her about south africa .
she lost her head .
the coughit is nothing , she gasped .
now , with a feeling of conscious virtue , i took note of what was going on .
they march .

they were followed by a man who could make noises .
eh ma foi !
your life and mine have nothing to do with each other .
but theres no reason to believe he speaks broken english and gesticulates with his hands .
well , i dont think perhaps youre quite as keen on finding out things as she is , but i think youre just as likely to get on to it because i think youre rather good at finding sources .
my aunts paying for it , really , or helping .
oh , i dont knowyou didnt bring her down with you , though .

maude said sharply : please dont upset your uncle , george .
however vague she might have been when he questioned her , she was quite positive about it now .
i i i will not answer any more questions , she whispered .
it cant have taken her all this time .
she held out on me with information .
they found the place at last , a big rambling house , surrounded by deserted grounds , with a swift mill stream running behind the house .

and i wonder , she added to herself as she unwillingly closed the front door , having stared inquisitively at their retreating backs , who you two might be .
hubbard said : i always fancied myself in comedy parts .

at last a third tin was brought to light .
dash it , he ought to be dead .
yes , it was not pretty , said poirot dryly .
somewhat grudgingly nurse hopkins drew back and poirot was permitted to cross the threshold .
and now for what i like and dont like .
sally hasnt said anything to me , she said .
i dont want to go back , butoh , tommy , what else is there to do ?
you have not stirred ?
clegg .
he saw her chin go up .
so am i , a little .
how can i possibly tell ?
concussion , the doctor says .

ellie enjoyed showing her the house .
lucy .
the worst of me is i have an infernal weakness for making out a case .
he said with immense dignity : i tell you , sir .
they gave prizes for them .
who are you afraid of ?
i think it must have worked loose or something .

in spite of himself a feeling of uneasiness was stealing over him .
to london , yes .
in between times , to keep her hand in , as she expressed it , she walked out with the greengrocers young man , and the chemists assistant .
everything was very empty , very empty indeed .
your masterly deductions and may i add , your discretion ?
when we were living in norfolk .
oh well , i suppose it often happens .
it was the latter one that was beginning to buzz .
you didnt like john christow .
but you knew mrs .
from close on six onwards servants were moving about the camp , people were going to and from their tents .
anthony returned his gaze steadily .
but another name had caught the inspectors attention .
we have to thank you , mademoiselle , for coming to us so promptly , said poirot .
then she got up and said rather shyly : iim really most awfully grateful .
i reflected a moment or two .
nellie bligh , they call her in the village .
that just happened .
what would be the point of such a thing ?
she said glacially : a monsieur lefarge of the prfecture called to see me , to see if i could throw any light upon the situation .
this person may have seen the gold box she carried about with her and made some opportunity to discover what it contained .
shes paid the penalty .
mary gerrard , whose father had just died , was clearing out the lodge .
leidner cry out at once for help ?
its absurd !
what have i done with it ?
i hope not , though .
a hobby is a great consolation to a man .
im certain thats the way it was !
i was going to point out to you that here everyone is on holiday .
he announced : here is your wild boar , gentlemen .
he spoke rather loudly as to a deaf man .

these things are always known at once , and a man of his experience should know that well enough ; but dr .

this is a great blow to us all .

that night renauld will first bind and gag his wife , and then , taking a spade , will dig a grave in that particular plot of ground where he knows ahow do you call it ?
and sothe truth becomes plain .
that was his vanity .
you have given me now the clue to yet another piece of my problem .
shes a sweet creature , as you know , miss marple , and she ought to have love and attention .
perhaps theyre right !
twenty-one the personk .
elinor held her breath for a minute , then she began to speak with nervous haste , the words tumbling out incoherently : theres something more : i want toits only righti mean , youve got to have your proper share , roddy .
all of them , i thought , had something in common with my early memories of pantomime .
sugden took out his notebook .
she scrutinized it , frowning .
only emily brent demanded and obtained a glass of water .
shes got bad blood in herher father ought to have seen the inside of a prison more than once .
but hes a first-class gardener .
in front of poirot , set back a little , was the roman catholic church of the assumption , a small modest affair , a shrinking violet compared to the aggressiveness of st .
there was the child to be considered and everything .
i will call upon her about ten oclock .
now and again we have a great man , thank god .
hercule poirot said : there is no question of failure .
luke said with a slight shiver : i shant forget how i only got there just in time .

im frightened .
the living-room had given up all its secrets in a very few minutes .
clear as paint , said the inspector .
like birds of prey .
grace and the sopworth girls joined him on the beach a quarter of an hour later .
i should think they probably were just thrown into the wastepaper basket ?
he wasnt sure why his mind went back to the airport lounge .
you care about this man .
only , if you move in different spheres , that does not happen .
magnificent , said the little doctor with enthusiasm .
very like colonel protheroe , but i dont know about it being absurd , said miss marple .
and so , you see , i actually saw him slip the packet of stropanthin in douglas gold ' s coat pocket .
but hardly , i fear , as accurate as one might wish .
i promised , you see .
but howdonovan , what is it ?
i shall not part with a penny of it .
the taller of the two stood for a moment with his back to the house surveying his surroundings .
i took a serious view of his offence .

you dont want to , sally told him .
no , my meaning about von deinim is this .
which of the students might normally , at any time , be in your room ?

i sat down unobtrusively a little way off .
miss lettice went out to a tennis party in the two-seater .
she did not do anything as far as i can remember .
he must be mad , said griselda .
easterbrook greeted phillipa haymes with a little extra cordiality to show that she quite understood that phillipa was not really an agricultural labourer .
or is that cowardice ?
hercule poirot closed his eyes in agony .
i knew then that miss wills definitely suspected sir charles of being the murderer .
skunks like that take a lot of killing .
none !
said poirot , making a tactful sound .
he pushed it open .
you dont like it ?
seen the tripps ?
its all over , and nothing like that will ever happen to you again .
i had an explanation for thati thought i had , i mean .
, fell off a bus .
mightnt they desert to the other side ?
then stephen farraday , then iris , then ruth lessing who sat on my left .
her face , usually pretty and rather vapid , was like a little pinched weasel face .
when the theft is discovered and davis is missing , the implication will be overwhelming .
or his wife may have done it .
he repeated it twice , then hung up the receiver with a thoughtful face .
ought to see if there are any traces of a man waiting in there .
i have been given to understand that you were in the neighbourhood at that timebetween _num_ : _num_ and _num_ : _num_ in the evening , and you may have seen something that may have a bearing on the matter ?
looking out to sea , poirot remarked : mrs .
babies so soon grow out of the first size .
he went to his room and examined the weapon .
monsieur bex will be so kind as to bring it to us here .
i was just thinking about our district nurse .
more probably a flat or maisonette .
shes made that way .
still on the track of your unsuccessful murderer ?
why had he deserted the riviera which he knew so well and where he was so well known ?
used to alleviate pain and as a sleeping draught .
the other laughed in a shamefaced manner .
jennifer looked disappointed .
barnes conducted him upstairs .
you did all you could .
dont trust me , dont believe in meim no goodapart from my work .
franoise shrugged her broad shoulders .
the triangleyou said yourself hercule poirot nodded his head vigorously .
from all i have heard and been told , said poirot , that would indeed be a disaster .
he said , i wonder what was on that paper that the coroner wouldnt have at any price ?
you can come to me in my sitting room anytime this evening .
mabel is a good girlmabel stuck up for me , but i knew she wouldnt be able to stand up against geoffrey .
no , said dakin slowly .
oh , yes , archie , a nasty horrid black thing .

norton frowned again .

inglethorp that i am here .
those , she pointed at the phialsdaddy .
to my surprise , we still kept a northerly route .
alistair blunt said without much interest : she could have two pairs of shoes , i suppose ?
there was a slight change , a stiffening in neviles tone as he said : no , she had a headache .

street accident .
and one tangible cluethe bridge scores .
marrakesh is terribly expensive , said miss hetherington .
you got hold of him and made him do it !
the huxleys could not join me in this sport because they were engaged with their governess during the morning , and the same held for audrey .
true , we have a body , but we have no proof even that the man was murderedprussic acid , when inhaled , leaves no trace .
he found it difficult to know whether he himself liked michael garfield or not .
dont be absurd , dennis , i said irritably .
harry , if colonel race hadnt told me , what did you mean to do ?
poirot gave her a quick glance .
my duty as the vicaress .
the whole stable knows .
colin ?
i was in a corridor oncea corridor outside a door , her door .
find out where he was and what he was doing last night .
it came to him with fresh amazement that a man could so imbue a conventional subject with his own particular magic .
imagine a criminal nowadays on whom one was unable to put the handcuffs because he had never done anything himself .
jeremy rose to his feet .
gordon was jealous of the bird .
so long , then .
it is one that happens to run over the first initial on top of the case .
thats been helped on .
i suspect one particular person .
forgery ?
then his heart sank .
wasnt he supposed to have done away with a goodish few ?
most of the graves here were of an older date .
good nightand thank you .
the italian seemed the first person to demur to this view .
chatting together , the party returned to the boat .
i think its even possible that they may all have different ideas .
if i had only someone i could ask .
you are good to me , yahmose , she said gratefully .
_num_ campden street i had sold at an excellent profit .
the same thing has happened with constructional engineers , with aviators , with electricians and many other skilled trades .
theres something id like to tell you .
did he come by my train ?
horror !
the young men , those are the ones i am bringing here .
or an international one .
there was something curiously dead about her face .
normally shed have changed into a black velvet dress for our spanish dance .
pagett appeared to be perfectly convinced of that .
now , my good georges , what have you to say about the matter ?
i think , caterham , if i may say so , that you hardly appreciate the fact that eileen is grown up .
he went into the green park , and dropped down upon a seat .
mcgrath .
the girl rose and stood facing him .
lady stoddart-west ?
the girl who , very likely , had disliked her stepmother and shown it with the careless ruthlessness of youth .
he stood for some moments at the washstand , where there was a big array of bottles and toilet creams .
would that be louisa , sir ?
there seems also a certain lack of motive , said mr .
i think i heard a kind of splash just as i was dropping off to sleep .
she frowned , evidently running over the names in her mind , and helping her memory by occasionally checking them off on her fingertips .
probably shes only trying it on .
before such profuse apologies , my anger was forced to melt .
i met her at dinner the other night .
canvassing for the conservative party .
supper is laid all ready in the dining-room .
every word he spoke was uttered , so poirot felt assured , sheerly for effect .
he was actually in the act of typing a letter to him when he was shot .
i think we shall find treasures .
not in trouble over my car lights again , i hope ?
donaldson is anxious to have a talk with me .
there , between the shoulder blades , staining the light fawn overcoat , was a round dark patch .
he had been nearly asleep .
it makes us all see red .
i saw them go into the lift myself .
then philip blake said suddenly : no , if i do itill do it for nothing .
they are my enemiesthey want to put me in prisonto shut me up .
ii poirot lunched with the doctor in a pleasant square room with a window open on to the garden .
one fine day a delicious meal is cooked for dear old mother , and then she goes walking away over the iceand doesnt come back one should be proud of leaving life like thatwith dignity and resolution .
you and your audrey !
i do wish youd listen when im talking , said cherry .
pull yourself together , mr sanders .
then had come rosemarys engagement to george barton .
if you must know , yes .
only a somewhat mediocre young woman seeking for another life-sized hero to put on an empty pedestal .
and shes had any amount to contend against , ended the young man warmly .
the government consider it as mere bluff on their part , and , rightly or wrongly , have stuck to the policy of absolute denial .
miss wheeler , _num_ clapington road , battersea .
rafiel was dead .
riseley-porter could speak .
she would tell the police she had seen the crime committed , and no cross-examination would shake her , he was sure of that .
it will be all over warmsley heath by this evening , said mr .
most every night , said the other .
as far as i noticed , she seemed exactly as usual , he said .
mrs ditchburn loved entertaining guests .
really , it is too dreadful .
the operation has succeeded to a miracle , he remarked , gazing at the result .
and even that im not very fond of doing .
poirot and i have returned today from london .
you have the privilege of seeing m .
no calling in of scotland yard .
she referred to a luminous ribbon issuing from miss arundells mouth and forming a luminous haze round her head .

a mercy killing !
here was the spot where he had lived when he first came to this country .
this did not discourage himon the contrary .
who are thethe friendth of yourth ?
sure you wont change your mind , mr .
and richards a damned nuisance and completely useless into the bargain , as men always are when youre ill .
there seemed to be something weighing on us all .
should not our ideas be the same ?
i lookedoh , yes , of course !
i was not very near and he was absorbed in what he was doing .
hed have had to get used to you .
if they will let you .
it isnt amy !
slung it over my shoulder .
iriss face clouded over again .
sheila webb had been getting slack lately .
she knows that you are in m .
shed been secretary , you know , to that very rich man , goedler .
the moon came out from behind the cloud and saltcreek was once more bathed in silvery radiance .
perhaps one ought not to feel so , she said , but it is rather gratifying to form a theory and get proof that it is correct !
templeton some time , said frankie , speaking slowly and clearly .
thats one of mr somerset maughams , isnt it ?
riddle glanced over at poirot who was sitting absorbed in thought .
they closed in on him and bore him down .
the doctor was quite surprised , i know .
a shade bitter perhaps but hardly noticeable .
such a melancholy task going through all dear mrs .
as you know only too well , i am no longer in possession of them .
with a slow , likeable smile walter fane said : my mother spoils me , im afraid .
so he said : take it away .
when i came home that night the house was emptyempty .
upjohn and the distressing and unexpected arrival of lady veronica .
murgatroyds not even had the sense to bring the washing in .

colonel luttrell , i said coldly , isnt that type of man .
a place where id have a course of treatmentor something .
you understand , i see .
but the doors fit well .
cook was with me and we were both terribly upset .
well , that makes things easier , said miss marple .
he is kind to everybodyand as gentle as a womanif women are gentle , she added , doubtfully .
no , its not youyouve got one of the regular guest-rooms .
lansquenets room to see if she were asleep or if she was ready for some tea .
no , there you are wrong .
she determined to get hold of that paper at all costs , and in this resolution chance came to her aid .
methodist she was .
ive been a fool not to know it beforenot to know journeys end when i saw it .
one should do the thing thoroughly .
poirot heard the sound of the receiver being replaced at the other end , then he heard a very faint second clickand smiled to himself .
have you been with mr .
well , there was a bit of fuss when it came to probating , or whatever you call it , the old ladys will .
she herself knew nothing of science , but it seemed not at all unlikely .
what was that something ?
sir george mentioned the names of two european powers .
very inconsiderate , said lord caterham obstinately .
sounds fantastic , but they managed it somehow .
the front door banged just now and mrs .
suppose someone wanted badly to prevent your going to chimneys ?
either , i should say , replied len .
the outside world impinged much less than it had in my fathers time .
at least , of course , i can imaginei can imagine anything !
coffee was handed round .
of _num_ o course , there are many houses nearer to the front of house on the road , but as it happens , daisymead , though some distance away , is the only house visible this side .
he has passed the real ones to a confederate one of the aforementioned worthy citizens .
if you were to stop loving me !
and your second husband ?
major eustace .
damned painful , the whole thing .
a kind of spiritual spring cleaning ?
i prefer to take this way out and to spare two innocent people the ordeal of being charged with a murder they did not commit .
yet he was a man who had spent his time in wild places , who professed to prefer wild places .
all that , dont you , mrs lee ?
no sooner were we at home than he flew to the telephone .
the young loversor the disapproving dame ?
at the vicarage .
i cannot bear the taste of spirits .
cayley , the nitwitted mrs .
i will tell you one thing more , monsieur poirot , he announced , opening the door and turning back to face the detective .
that tone of determined heartiness did not ring quite true .
she interrupted him .
she had asked .
and the girls giggle .
this , my dear girlthis .
he does not blame himself for what happened .
he began to move restlessly about the room .
there are many such at the present time .
tommy blushed , his face assuming a prawn-like hue at the praise .
mon ami , you do not change .
she said shed be waiting for me in the hall at half-past ten .
tommy said , flushing slightly : i dont like lying any better than you do tuppence interrupted him .
mademoiselle will perhaps remain outside .
but she died two or three years ago , so of course one doesnt hear about her much .
lieutenant simpson had the carriage to himself .
you make me feel afraid .
walking away from the inspector , she said more to herself than to him , i knew you wouldnt believe me if i told you the truth .
what has all this got to do with it ?
ripe fruit , fresh picked .
alice cunningham did not admit in so many words that she did not know .
occasionally one of the secret service men came to report progress .
you have been very honest , mademoiselle , said poirot .
that is a gross breach of confidence .
to mount on a chair and bother to dust so high up there not all domestics would be so conscientious .
they said all those lavatories would be an enormous improvement if the place was going to be turned into a girls school .
remember the words of mayerling , the man who took refuge hereonly to die by the hands of his enemies .
miss carlisles going to settle two thousand pounds on her , which i call very handsome and more than what many would do .
it was a big , solidly built red-brick mansion , with no pretensions to beauty , but with an air of solid comfort .
i do not know , hastings , if what i have done is justified or not justified .
the train was robbed .
spragg has called to see you , sir .
we then said we wanted a hotel .
but i do remember mr .
well , thats the same everywhere , said ellie .
poirot , thus pressed into service , was worked by mrs .
she was very anxious to see you .
i confess i enjoy this intricate , this elaborate use of the alibi .
i am sorry , said miss marple apologetically .
hubbard herself , still in her outdoor things , her nice round face strained and anxious , sat on the sofa .
either shed dead or alive .
miss pierce , to whom the question was addressed , shook her head vaguely .
im on a holiday , mrs .
the guide moved away , smiling indulgently and telling them firmly that they must see the museum later .
after tea , roger played trains with his nephew .
he paused for a minute and then went on : you see , dis a fighter .
and i daresay youre right .
tim kendal , her husband , lean , dark and in his thirties , had also been kindness itself .
my dear , of course not .
the front door was kept locked , but there was a side door giving on the garden which was not locked until evening .
hercule poirot , that man of the world , knew better .
yes , we were .
she held out , at once , a piece of paper to him .
poirot replied promptly : j stands for jacqueline de bellefort , a young lady who declared to me less than a week ago that she would like nothing better than to he paused and then deliberately quoted , to put my dear little pistol close against her head and then just press with my finger gott im himmel exclaimed dr .
i cant stick my neck out and diagnose a murderer without some evidence .
' ' so that there is every reason to suppose that mr farley .
i wonderdo you think i could have just a little brandy ?
and it would have been quite impossible for him to have done so without my seeing him .
was she unhappy ?
your conduct has been notorious , the talk of london .
then i shall see him for as long as i please in the dock .
let them take the testimony they had heard and sift it impartially .
and then the shropshire address .
well , thats one way of looking at it , said jane .
ill get the men to get it open for you tomorrow if that will do .
it means that she has discovered monsieur lawrence does not dislike her as much as she thought , replied poirot philosophically .
the good open air , you will not leave it in the open .
it was true that there was a great opening for this type of craft .
thats true , admitted lady coote .
janes in america , has been for weeks .
i know a much nicer text , a happy text .
or if a woman was found unconscious or ill in a carriage and was removed to hospital , that , too , will be on record .
and it is immediately followed by another .
shes terrible really , said poppy .
she came round in the most awful state of nerves .
i suppose it did sound like that .
he was smiling now , happily .
poirot , and his little grey cells .
she has heard the song of a human heart .
last night she shut her eyes and gulped reminiscently .
either a very deceitful or a very simple young man you are .
mother didnt very often talk about him .
if we knew that , wed know very nearly all we wanted to know , said esa .
but it made you a little nervous , perhaps ?
i suppose we dont really , agreed bridget .
and he said it was all a plot .
that all holds together , but on a second repetition of destruction , i get sea , which appears utterly irrelevant .
i read one of your books , said ann to mrs .
and that leavesjust what exactly ?
thats probably donald ross , i said as i went across to the instrument .
i know no one who annoys me more .
and whats the other tip ?
why should they be so forbearing to missto the performing fish ?
it was much as poirot remembered it : the dim colours of the old rugs , the books .
they had sworn that no stranger had entered the premises .
the lighting was indirect and flooded the room with a soft but cold light .
make yourself comfortable .
a look of fear sprang up in his face .
but the person he really cares for is mary aldin , though he doesnt know it yet himself .
blore said dubiously : think theyd swallow that ?
there was nothing to do but wait and watch .
those are his two wives , i understand .
poirot said : do youperhapsremember her maid ?
our local murder is considered worthy of the attention of scotland yard .
armstrong said : nobody in their senses carries potassium cyanide .
it was a severe blow .
ill remember when im questioning them .
bessner stroked his jaw again .
thats lord trenchards new kind , said lily with respect .
wrapped in loves young dream !
then my father died .
coggins , my good friend , said the erstwhile inspector , addressing his ruffianly looking associate , take your life preserver and stand by the prisoner .
can we not , you and i , nofret , can we not be sisters to each other ?
lombard said irritably : of course not .
i did not really mean to come in , but mr .
mr washington lob was the closest thing to mr turveydrop that i can imagine .
but you , will they bully you over it ?
he knows things .
the second body _num_ .
twenty pounds ?
a morning coffee .
by the pricking of my thumbs postern of fate memoirs an autobiography come , tell me how you live credits cover design and illustration by faith laurel copyright this book is a work of fiction .
and the words sounded like mummy , somehow .
opalsen as a sort of greek chorus .
we hadnt really believed , either of usor had we ?
i see , said weston .
inside was a small white box tied with silver ribbon .
i guess he thought youd turned up your toes .
it was possible that something had transpired in that interview which would throw light upon the problem of his murder .
im so pleased .
seems very sensible to me , said the general .
arent you even going to put a coat on , micky ?
you will feel it sooner or later .
everyone is staring at us .
they often have people to dinner and stopping with them , and mrs .
he went on softly .
shes all right , he said .
hitlers mental condition worsened , and he died insane , believing himself to be commanding his armies in the field .
then she pressed a bell and sauntered across to cornelia and sat down .
but poirot had turned to the nurse and was eagerly demanding information .
it took place , remember , in the early hours of the _num_ ththe day he had arrived for the crime .
she is no longer a child .
hes just brought me a piece of a letter which he says the foreign gentleman dropped .
torquil ericsson , an impractical dreamer .
' ' oh ' hercule poirot .
it seems to me so obvious .
i suppose its all part of his illness really .
it would be a challenge !
but nothing out of the way on it so far as i can see .
why do you read karl marx ?
but she simply wouldnt take the hint !
the way she was lying , thrown across the seat , shows that .
it might , of course , have been done on purpose , he said slowly .
the threatening letters would have been produced by m .
poirot stopped , and stretched out his hand for another boiled egg .
who is she ?
no , it was written on purpose , and put in the dead womans pocket for us to find .
upward suddenly .
he retreated hastily to a position on the main drive , and began in a deep roar , coupled with an unsteady gait , the following ditty : i am a soldier a jolly british soldier ; you can see that im a soldier by my feet .
our intourist friend saw us off at the train .
my toothbrush ?
here is my card with my address .
tuppence was conscious of some undercurrent of strong feeling moving him powerfully .
she added abruptly : go to bed , minnie .
a great weariness came over conway jefferson .
i will tell you the story as i have pieced it outnot as it came to me imperfectly and in flashes .
rather a bad nervous breakdownlapses of memory , and severe nervous exhaustion .
it is natural , i suppose , to cling to life , i mused .
to his great surprise , the lorry turned in at the gate of his own house .
and what about tonights performance ?
she thought : id like to kill her .
it had qualities of magic , of enchantment , certainly of beauty , bashful beauty , yet wild .
that rather shows , doesnt it , that she was a pretty uncontrolled sort of person ?
it may merely be different editions .
a lion or a tiger or a leopard or a cheetah !
the inside was unattractive .
i suppose , i said heavily , you wanted to get me into your toils .
bassington-ffrench !
can i go now ?
evans shook his head .
pengelleys death , and found pengelley replacing the bottle of weed killer on the pantry shelf , mrs .
he went up two flights of stairs to the top floor , then pushed up a trapdoor in the roof and hung a ladder to it .
oh , i dont know , she said .
inclined to breathe hard in moments of professional strain .
i couldnt bear him to go away somewhere .
that way we should show our hand .
its pleasant .
i want you to get her off .
he said heavily : i always worry about you , lucy .
you really are .
it would be better if she were dead so much better .
it was our agitated young man of the pale face .
its just one oclock .
the count considered for a moment .
having spent what she considered a reasonable sum upon these household investments , she indulged in various excursions of her own .
she kept saying she wasnt safe .
first floor practically wasnt touched .
the bearers knew the truth , of course , but they were all devoted to me and i knew that what i said theyd swear to if need be .
a lady called upon mr .
will you give me the name and address of miss crabtrees lawyer ?
its there all right .
two girls passed the car , toiling slowly up the hill .
she had some difficulty with itthe screw top seemed to resist her efforts .
it seems to me that stephen lane is at least a possibility .
it could have been thrust into the shrubbery by the owner of no .
perhaps a little of trollope , but not to drown in him .
i said that i would have finished with her well before that as i had an appointment myself .
there is really nothing to discuss , said clemency .
hes madreligious mania .
she paused a minute , ignoring the little mans bow over her hand , and his murmured madame , and then , releasing his hand after a sudden vigorous pressure , she exclaimed : i believe in small men !
dont you see , if most people were taken ill after whatever it wasdinner or lunch one day and it was looked into , and they found out about the mistake , well , things do happen like that .
an enormous fortune had been left to rosemary in which iris was not to participate .
luke took her by the shoulder .
eagles nest merely struck james as being silly , and buena vista was beyond his linguistic accomplishments .
he insinuates that what he picked up was the silk rosebud , he plays the part of the young man in love shielding the lady he loves .
she hasnt begun to realize things yet .
she mentioned once that shed met you not long ago .
mary mead was having the most exciting morning it had known for a long time .
edward stirred his sugar in with his spoon .
coo !
cust hurried across the yard and out into the street .
he paused before adding , rather an attractive girl ?
tuppence , he thought , would at this moment be doing something silly or foolish or , if not that , she would be doing something which might not be silly or foolish but would be highly dangerous .
purvis , but you were surprised ?
the other girl who clearly had not much english merely nodded her head several times gratefully and smiled , and murmured grazie bright dark chestnut fuzzy curls escaped from her head scarf and she had on big earnest looking spectacles .
sorry , harry .
looked ill she did .
swettenham sighed .
she stared out to sea .
i insist .
and that really is all , miss amory concluded .
yes yes , we have heard .
i even heard him mention poirot in a casual way at dinner one night .
the manager met me and took me out to lunch .
wed no idea you were in england , christian , said mrs .
if only there were something here that she couldwellget her teeth into .
everything must be done according to law and precedent .
that idea undoubtedly pleased her best .
i beg pardon , sir , but dr .
i acted in amateur theatricals a good deal at one time , said norman gale stiffly .
as he was giving his order to the waiter a hand was placed on his shoulder .
miss grey keeps her secrets to herself .
she asked , the picture of consternation .
when did she leave her husband ?
ah , theres some deep idea behind that .
there is something .
that wasnt the point of my question .
im not brave .
its something else .
especially about accidents .
hautet stroked his beard reflectively .
and then he gave the translation in english .
yes , but thats all right , because i dont dance .
giles and gwenda had not gone with inspector last and dr .
and she sleeps soundly .
nothing exciting ever happened to me , so i began to play my little game .
voyons , mademoiselle annie , all that you shall tell us will be of the greatest importance .
it excuses some things .
then he said carelessly : what was the rumpus this morning ?
your sister saw you take it .
the curse came upon him suddenly .
and she buried the girl there in the garden , piled the bricks over her and the earth and the turf did neither of the other sisters suspect it ?
he went across and joined the young man .
they foster ideas .
some of the people who were concerned , who passed a certain personage on from place to place under different disguises , under different names , some of those people , on our looking back and making inquiries , we find did not live as long as they might have done .
we passed through them .
she picked up the violets , spilt the water on the frayed place and switched on the lamp .
said shed call again this afternoon .
wake up .
sir rowland and old hugo went straight into the dining-room and i came in a bit later .
leo had never had any children .
he held it out and poirot took it .
the car is here , madam , he said .
he said to himself : this job isnt going to be exactly easy .
it would also have distressed henriettas irish hunting forebears .
well , i wont keep you any longer , doctor .
you both came here full of your own affairs and the person who let you in was only a parlourmaid .
he brought a letter from andrew marshall with him .
michael knows where the well is but he wont tell me .
hoffman , but such things happen .
i wonder if perhaps she gets car sick .
heres a nondescript , rather moronic kid found strangled and not a hint of any possible motive .
and the doctor he says , wheres her room ?
i hate nannie i hate her i hate her she says i am only a little girl .
be careful , my friend .
cinderella warned him , im sure .
i thought perhaps it was only me .
her eyes widened as they followed the ascending spiral of smoke , and she repeated in a low , monotonous voice : everywhere , everywhere .
but , as far as you know , he had not done so on this occasion ?
who certified the death ?
i always thought of him as a cousin .
glynne , anthea !
oliver began to work things out .
he still held that office .
it was a creation in creamy brocade , with a faint pattern of gold running through it and an undernote of pale pink to give warmth to the cream .
there were no mountains , no hills anywhere .
she said , oh , yeseryes ?
finally they altered their tactics .
i was justreminding you like .
the irish commissionaire , back on duty , made up her mind for her .
my letters were without originality .
the bedouin guards went ahead , swinging up the precipitous slopes unconcernedly , without a downward glance at the sheer drop on one side of them .
but it doesnt have a good effect on people who go out of idle curiosity .
nasty things , aeroplanesid never go in one of them .
garfield ought never to have let him go off alone the way he did .
this is lady frances derwent speaking , said the voice coldly .
no , im staying at my club for a day or two .
she is beautiful .
demanded the millionaire .
after a minute or two she said , peering through half-shut lids at the young woman sitting beside her : well , got what you want ?
i only smoke cigarettesgaspers , sir .
i took a job with mrs .
slowly he shook his head and frowned .
then a day or two later i ate another of the same chocolates , and the same thing happened .
he went out and walked most evenings after dark .
imhotep stood scratching nervously behind his ear .
do you remember telling me that there was a final clue written on one of the comics that marlene was given to amuse her ?
they always do , said mrs .
but they both liked the idea of having a homesome place of their own .
but those two women , you know , were much of an age and height and size .
altogether an odd personalitybut indeed there was something odd about the whole family , or was it his imagination ?
gwenda the perfect , helpful secretary , working for him , always at hand , kind , helpful .
charlotte must , i think , have overheard a good deal that morning she came into the caf .
said bundle , momentarily taken aback by his fervour .
boy , he called in peremptory fashion .
the crowds , the music , the fantastic dresseseverything conspired to make the young couple enjoy themselves .
pagett brandishing a revolver .
sir carmichael clarke had purchased a site of some two acres commanding an uninterrupted view of the sea .
wheres that girl ?
forrester to see .
one must stand by ones friends , replied the other dryly .
hori spoke in a gentle , speculative voice .
' putting away his f ' fle , mr carlile asked : ' will you want me any more tonight , lord mayfield ?
no doubt about that .
but in your opinion it was not your sons fault ?
well , he growled .
lacey leant back with a sigh of satisfaction .
she understood mr .
i believe she asked your advice about it .
my dear colonel melchett , you know what young women are nowadays .
the inspector wrote it down .
or were those eyes saying something that the real woman did not know ?
he frowned , lost in thought .
what is the deep idea , george ?
i think you had , said emily .
she shot a quick , alarmed glance at him .
the little maid who opened the door informed him that mr .
hes got something on his mind .
miss marples final cases ( _num_ ) despite the title , the stories collected here recount cases from the middle of miss .
though it turned out afterwards that he was taking a course in mineralogyor do i mean geology ?
her eyelids fluttered and her lips just murmured his name .
i could not help feeling that , so far , poirot had not greatly distinguished himself , and it vexed me .
its bad for patients .
les femmes , naturally , they must look after themselves .
there seems a fairly clear case against him .
moreover , being a highly intelligent young woman , shed be careful not to be the only one unaffected .
i was looking , monsieur , for this .
we must make good this timeand , disguise the fact as i might , poirot had the better brain of the two .
the young lady very nearly fell down behind the counter , but long training in scornfulness just kept her erect .
then give me my stick .
sir rowland took a lighter from the occasional table by the sofa to light clarissas cigarette .
the whole thing may be a lie .
she would hardly be having an amicable conversation with a burglar ?
there is a very good case against you , monsieur allerton .
in my bunk asleepand my mate will tell you so .
she passed the gates of sittaford house on her right and shortly after that the lane took a sharp turn to the right and ran steeply up hill and came out on the open moor where it degenerated into a grass track and soon petered out altogether .
any girl , or almost any girl , can be neurotic , especially in adolescence , and in her first encounters with the world .
motherhoodunrelenting !
she came up about a quarter to ten .
weve really got a lot in commonand we know all about each other and all that .
printed in the wrong colour .
the car swerved to the left and they were bowling along upon a well-paved road of imposing width .
chapter twenty-eight i miss marple smoothed over the top of her suitcase , tucked in an end of woolly shawl and shut the lid down .
and so you hid that second body in a place where it would not be too easily discovered .
when he returned , i , without having moved from my apartments , was able to tell him exactly what he had found .
was anything taken ?
the other day a young woman , an ordinary tourist , in france , was asked by a casual acquaintance if shed take a pair of shoes across the channel .
it seemed likely that if the precious article had been safely got out of ramat it would be brought to princess shaista or to her relatives and guardians .
thirty-one a human document a day or two after that i was suddenly recalled to the argentine .
did sir gervase say anything else that may have had a bearing on the situation ?
with care and delicacy he salved the object .
he produced the little square of fine cambric .
i hoped we might finish this morning .
i somehow got the impression that you had been putting the cat among the pigeons , inspector craddock .
oh , how lovely , said miranda .
possibly thrown into the lake in passing .
if only she knew .
youd find that very boring .
the room was an old one with broad black beams across the ceiling and it was furnished with good old furniture that belonged to it .
probably not important but quite righterto remember everything .
glancing up at the sky , blore remarked : looks all right to me .
she ' d be very ea .
and you have to plan things .
i stayed only a short time , so as not to tire her , and on leaving decided not to return direct to drymouth along the coast road as i had come , but instead to go north to redmyn and see old canon peasmarsh , who has some very rare books in his library , including an early treatise on navigation from which i was anxious to copy a passage .
he wasnt able to find you at once , i understand ?
kreuzhammer on inferiority and crime .
no , dr .
what did you say , renisenb ?
she was about twenty-eight or -nine , he supposed .
father looked up at him .
im quite good at remembering faces .
very , very kind .
thats what you say , said sarah .
sometimes it seems sad to think of how much waste there has always been .
it was a well-shaped foot , with a good ankle and an expensive stocking , but i did not like the shoe .
his four days imprisonment had taught him anew to value good food .
small wonder the girl had held her tongue , and played her part so consistently .
said emily .
wellthis is one of the neighbourhoods we thought of .
you think he was murdered ?
an old bore , a windbagenfinthe stuffed shirt !
hell stay like that for hours , sir .
well , returned mr .
i do not believe that celia had a cinderella complex or that she stole things without knowing what she was doing .
had he been with sir reuben long , then ?
i did not see anyone that particular afternoon .
he had been to the pictures and proceeded to tell them in detail the plot of wandering minstrel , laid in the reign of richard the first .
but it doesnt square with what she was overheard to say .
a curse has gone rusty unable to stand the strain of modern life .
conrad is certainly no good at all .
it seems to me , said mrs .
it only needed cohesion .
one uses ones natural intelligence .
there was a kind of concert-room at the end of the pier , not used in winter of course , and this was opened as a kind of indoor rink .
yes , isnt it ?
moody was bumped off because she definitely recognized someone who had been connected with criminal activities .
they dont come in sequence in the book .
she looked faintly amused .
and the person to whom you telephoneddoes the name begin with a por perhaps with an h ?
ive done my duty and im out of it .
alfred said : he victimized my fathervictimized him shamefully !
i was a pariah on several occasions in _num_ more than once as the result of the fashion for bips paste , which was applied to all wounds treated .
she still attends to my business affairs or anything of that kind .
sir rowland regarded her gravely .
i know this is considered by publishers as too short .
at last he got up and made his way outside .
some woman , perhaps , that wouldnt want something in her past raked up .
usually do , you knowshoot things , i mean .
forbes , that you must know who that man was ?
selective weed killer .
said sugden with heavy sarcasm , returning them to his pocket .
how good you are , said ruth .
no , mon cher , somehow i do not think he will be easy to find , your john fraser .
but he could only give me the address of a bank .
perhaps miss chevenix-goresor miss lingardsor even lady chevenix-gores .
woods suite , we had no time for more discussion .
i think youre wrong , clithering , in sticking to the theory that the girls death was meant .
a loud cry burst from richard scott .
said roger puzzled .
everyone has to see me first .
ill talk to you about it when youve finished reading the stuff .
yes , that is very curious .
no one came .
hesitantly , she put out a feeler .
now , i suppose , im in the devil of a mess .
i live in the country .
my life began again , first with the ending of the german war .
you always made a hit with linnet .
a big man .
do i mean arti ?
fell asleep forever in each others arms ?
ah yes , and i begin to have much success .
again his attention was arrested , held .
she merely repeated that miss wills pried into things that were no business of hers .
ah , but we did not leave her behind .
bundle had risen to her feet .
t poirot looked straight at her .
i said , looking alarmed .
i thought that that was probably particularly true in his case .
amy barton then and there seems to have decided on her plan of cold-blooded murder .
vandemeyer gave a sharp impatient exclamation , and jerked the girl to her knees .
gerald realized the peril , and he was terribly anxiousfor you .
well , we had a shot at solving itand we failed .
escorted by mrs .
those are the kind of sentiments that very soon go to the wall when the other sentiment comes along !
did miss cleves arrange some michaelmas daisies before dinner ?
it was a codicil written in her own handwriting .
because i think its possible that it might have a connection with that list of names you showed meive been down in the country with friendsat a place called much deeping , and they took me to an old pub , or what was once a pub , called the pale horse .
i was just telling miss marple how we have traced your movements .
i will get them , miss .
it is , so often , the unexpected that happens in this world .
i hope that you will be reasonable .
he has wriggled out of most things .
a good toss of the arm , and the pistol sinks , never to be recovered .
chapter _num_ sergeant cadwalladers announcement was greeted with a stunned silence .
perhaps you do know ?
oh , of course , its regard .
i think these people were at the solomon .
you had no idea they were married ?
how wonderful it is that you like the same books , and the same music .
what a splendid joke , said tuppence kindly .
now were getting at it .
he wants to take me out tomorrow ?
splendid , my boy , said mr .
and if so , said harry lee , then someone here in the house killed him .
part of the delight of this book lies in the way in which she moves as her fancy takes her ; breaking off here to muse on the incomprehensible habits of housemaids or the compensations of old age ; jumping forward there because some trait in her childlike character reminds her vividly of her grandson .
automatically from the depths of her dreams mrs .
going on for _num_ oclock ?
shes such a sporting girl that she would never go back on her word .
he looked puzzled and uncomprehending .
a robust man , george lomax , inclined to embonpoint , with a red face and protuberant eyes , and an immense sense of his own importance .
hes been a vicar here for years and everyone knows him .
something you want me to do ?
a crimewhere ?
yes , that stupid inspectorfor he is stupidhas everything pointing his way .
hed a sister and some nephews and nieces , i believe .
thats the way ive been living , said celia .
charlotte blacklock looked up and sniffed .
she picked up the doll from the desk and threw her back on the sofa .
figured velvet , and crimson at that , was a bad choice .
unhappy ?
left the house , of course .
where it juts out over the river ?
he said : my dearwhy didnt you come to my party ?
leach gave a deep sigh .
what a very queer way of putting it , inspector .
smiling a little , inspector , neele said : just blackbirds .
well , what do you want ?
yes , to prevent any chance of petty pilfering .
he increased his voice a little .
what do you think she did with lady stubbs body , if shes the guilty party ?
the lodge by the front gate of her former home .
oh , for gods sake , leave it alone !
yes , but its only temporary .
stafford nye had broken the silence first .
hannibal takes his duties very seriously , said mr .
nothing i can do for you , beryl ?
its aunt jennifer , she said softly .
a most mysterious case .
pamela grayle , her niece , obligingly gave up her cabin on the other side .
they arrived at heathrow and she assisted mrs .
it was an art perfected by long practice .
leonides was a good deal younger than her husband , was she not ?
a most refreshing little problem , said tommy .
he said suddenly .
ah , yes , i remember .
im glad you appreciate them .
but is it legal ?
which passenger ?
ring the bell , i pray of you .
women work roundaboutand they learn (if they are not born with the knowledge) to play on the weaknesses of men .
church leered at him slyly out of the corner of an unpleasant eye .
woe betide any husband who orders a bottle of weed killer nowadays .
did they get on well together ?
sarah shivered .
perhaps that is just as well , said miss marple .
nobody wasted much time since the interval for eating had not been very long .
truly i believe there was a blessing upon the house .
you want something from me ?
i know , said magda .
you werent with me , said miss hinchcliffe .
in haste , francis .
he was watching me narrowly .
supper , she said , rather breathlessly , and added , parentheticaly , i think its better than calling it dinner .
no good .
let me see , a russian , an american , an englishmana possible austrian or hungarianand the lady who may be any nationalityfor choice russian or polishthats a pretty representative gathering .
she doesnt like norma either .
jackie afflicks car ?
dont you worry , joanna , said emlyn price .
fanthorp said to cornelia : better get hold of miss bowers .
i had to ask the kind of questions that were directly to the point .
oh , henry , but they do .
slap it on .
perhaps your generation doesnt do it .
it seemed unbelievable .
thank youdr james whistler .
we were , at the time , under an intolerable strain .
friday last , just before i went away for the weekend .
satterthwaite go to yorkshire and sir charles and i go to gilling .
unless , said poirot , smiling , we can fit them into our little collection asshall we say ?
but if it was the husband i should think he would be more likely to poison her .
amused at her abruptness , he shook hands with her , then went to the door and opened it .
you know how i hate talking of things .
i consider it an impertinence , you comprehend , for a murder to be committed under my very noseby someone who mocks himself at my ability to solve it !
and yet , if you say to people , a leper colony they will shudder and give it a wide berth .
we analysed his glass .
rules were drawn up carefully .
satterthwaite and dr .
i hope to goodness they wont be full up before i get in .
rather like terriers .
still there ?
you have heard of this dancer womanmirelle ?
i knew always that id meet someone like you .
rather striking ?
it was the same woman she had seen yesterday and talking to her was carl von deinim .
then one year , owing to our growing importance , a kind of track was made to link us to the main road , and the actual road to mosul itself was tarmacked for a good length of its way .
stand up !
george said he didnt notice gas , but something made him feel very queer and overcome ; but he put that down to shockand probably it was .
its furnishings , she thought , were interesting .
he was a large , swarthy man , and he terrified me .
hed ask his way at a garage being careful to call attention to the timetwelve twenty-five , then drive on quickly , leave his car round a corner , slip on his police uniform and do his act .
patrick moved with alacrity through the archway .
i do not say that i disbelieve you , monsieur , said poirot slowly .
lorrimer pressed the bell by the fireplace .
she stuck her neck outand so she also , like mrs .
he thinks its easy , he thinks hes clever .
id better take it .
no more do i really , said michael weyman .
closing the door behind the man , he asked , what name , sir ?
he believed that she had told him what she knew .
theyre so juicy .
a bit messy , said mrs .
it is true that i promised my publishers my reminiscences early in the summer , but what of it ?
it was open .
miss read shook her head .
how can i possibly know ?
your husband will not object ?
but theyd look so effective against the snow , said bridget , and theyve got white facings , you know , so the blood could be on that .
ive got it all wrong .
they fixed on linda to be the scapegoat .
an elderly cleric with a thatch of thick white hair was climbing up from the permanent way .
the second act is pierrots cottage .
presently a rather more peremptory air hostess instructed them that cars were ready to convey them to the evening meal .
then if youre really good you can pick and choose your posts .
they couldnt go ploughing through snowstorms .
all is the same as it was between us ?
i mean , there seems to be in you , or so i feel it , a very strong belief that those two loved each other , that they meant to marry , but that something happened that prevented it .
most of the contents she swept on to the floor ruthlessly .
when we drew up before hallidays house , he skipped out nimbly , paid the driver and rang the bell .
to tell you who was there on that day , what they saw or said they saw , and where they were or said they were , is only a thing you could have observed for yourself if youd been there .
no , no , said miss marple .
im packing up .
yes , jeremy replied , but then quickly changed his answer .
does not the most excellent ashayet know that a spirit of evil life menaces her children ?
so , i think , is everyone .
ive had a drink instead .
when she had gone , mr .
vera sat up suddenly .
but rachel had had no doubts .
cried harrison .
he was lost in reminiscence for a moment , and then continued , clarissas best friend at school was a girl called jeanette collins , whose father had been a famous footballer .
trevelyan made a will , said burnaby promptly .
pennington smoothed out the letter on the table .
nobody can tell .
but i knewi knew what would happen .
for instance , i saw you wondering why i married mauriceoh !
not precisely because it was different , in fact he almost seemed to recognize it as a face he knew .
its very kind of you , said anne slowly .
it is serious .
very pleased to see you here , sir stafford .
yes ; but of course i cant say how much of each he ate .
quite the reverse , said the inspector , thinking of four clocks .
you mean that it was the maid who was the thief ?
before the meal was served poirot had caught the chief attendant by the sleeve and murmured something to him .
i see the direction in which your mind is tending , esa , said hori .
compared to john , he was an astoundingly difficult person to get to know .
she realized that , and respected it .
could you say definitely that anybody was in the great hall the whole time ?
i didnt quite understand what it was all about .
what do you mean , dispose of her ?
a very curious case altogther .
it was agonising to watch , and must have been anguish to endure .
she left the room once more .
christine said eagerly : yes , she cant have done it !
i thought it must be someone of the same name .
there were bullet holes already in that room if you remember , one more wouldnt be noticed .
by changing at dillmouth junction she can get here shortly after _num_ .
tuppence sighed and closed her eyes dreamily .
and yet , i cannot see why , or even how .
this isnt arthur at all .
you were there that day .
luke shook his head .
shall we really try it ?
he took my arm .
what more can i do to assist you ?
how does the world go with you ?
he came forward .
three clubs .
i shouldnt tackle it that way myself , said mrs .
for a moment the chief constables eyes narrowed .
reilly looked at me .
she denied most vehemently that she had anything to do with that .
or , a variation , miss springer noticed someone leaving the house , followed that someone , intruded upon something she wasnt meant to see or hear .
never mind , said victoria kindly .
that i am not at liberty to say , i said quietly .
but i cant do that .
ellie opened her bag and laid two half crowns in the old womans hand .
theres an etiquette in these matters .
dont believe its all kindness .
and take those violets away , said miss blacklock .
leo argyle and gwenda vaughan .
anne is the same .
the first thing to do is to interview miss lawson .
where ought i to be ?
leo said : you spokeyou gave him the impression that it wasnt good news .
they came softly along the corridor (both lombards and armstrongs rooms were farther from the stairhead than his) .
what do you say to that , horton ?
there was no surprise in the word .
	police are a brave and ' calm yourself , monsieur .
it was the usual , rather sad story .
what happens to that money ?
i and my friend , you comprehend , have business elsewhere , explained poirot .
in about five minutes poirot reappeared .
the men slung us down on the floor and left usalone with the mysterious creature in the mask .
kemps cup when he left the table and kemps cup when he returned to the table are not the same .
do so , monsieur , i implore you , do so .
of course shes dead now , poor woman , so one doesnt want to say much , but she was a perfect example of what i call the unintelligent domestic type .
i do like you , she said .
george lee to come here .
kirkwood , he said , for the information you have given me .
i canti dont know howhe had glasses , i thinkand a shabby overcoat .
i hadnt heard they were going abroad , i said .
dont see why his son should inherit this place .
mrs pritchard usually woke about eight .
but that , i told myself , might be merely characteristic of a film star .
her right hand came from behind her back .
lorrimer as she took her seat and began shuffling the cards in an expert manner .
miss flora ?
doctor and harley street .
just you think that if were right i expect my name will be in the papers !
nearly always , whenever you go anywhere by air , you hear it .
another of the disadvantages of having money that i hadnt known about !
are you sorry you ever met me ?
he has been a long time in america , said m .
they could easily be that , said jimmy unkindly .
the only ways out are a small door leading through on to the road which was found bolted inside as usual this morning and the main door to the house , which is set on the road .
youve got the whole ruddy fte to choose from , havent you ?
just the feeling that brenda was all alone on one side , and the concentrated animosity of the powerful leonides family was arrayed against her on the other side .
so damping .
old quarrels are patched up , those who have disagreed consent to agree once more , even if it is only temporarily .
as far as we know .
the chief constable looked a little disappointedrather like a man whose dog has refused to do its trick .
frankly , yes , i was surprised .
good watchdog , arent i ?
theres a town between us and that but we cant see it because of the hills bulging out farther down the slope .
this is yours , i think ?
it was easy to add arsenic to the tonic .
especially to a jeune homme comme atellement comme il faut ?
well , let us proceed .
i assure you that i will do my utmost to restore your daughter sound and well .
thats just what they have done , isnt it ?
yes , itll save quite a lot of bad things from happening , and it might save something that was important .
that , said anthony , was rather different .
on the following mrs todd ' s visit , our landlady informed friar a person of the name of eliza dunn had called .
with a man like old andrews in charge this was well-worn ground .
sir george nodded and left the room .
more conjecture .
he is pensioned off and lives in the little house near the lodge , but he is so devoted , and he insists on coming to wait on us at christmas .
he had knowledgeable information about where it would suit persons of all incomes and tastes to dine .
poirot nodded to him .
our fair client came in with an anxious expression on her face which changed to one of delight on seeing the letter and box which poirot held up .
we sent for the doctor , and after various inquiries as to what other things had been eaten , he took the remains of the chocolates away with him , and had them analysed .
its not a pleasant thing to find a murdered woman on your property ?
i rapped on the door and he himself opened it .
but all the same , m .
and i , he added , do not give up either .
he wiped his brow with a handkerchief , oblivious of the keen interest with which the other was regarding him .
here , however , they drew a blank , and crossing to the up platform tommy made inquiries of the ticket collector and of various porters .
but no hanky-panky , my girl .
you believe it was a man ?
where did the burgundy come from ?
then we moved on , and came at last to felujah on the euphrates , went over the bridge of boats , past the air station at habbaniyah , and on again , until we began to see palm-groves and a raised road .
drake looked surprised and shook her head .
never mind , you neednt tell me .
plays .
line em up , percy , said lance , laughing .
adapted by anthony shaffer and directed by michael winner , the film was shot in israel with a big-name cast including lauren bacall , carrie fisher , hayley mills , michael sarrazin and sir john gielgud .
his face twitched nervously .
and yet , you know , said mr .
my dear , cried her mother .
when do you go , by the way ?
bex excused himself for leaving us , explaining that he must immediately acquaint the examining magistrate with the fact of girauds arrival .
i feel everythings going to be all right now .
it was not at all her idea of a good match for her daughter .
rosina nunn stood upright , her hands clasped to her breast .
as we went out to the car park , another car drove away .
it was a full house , as it usually was .
ive never cared for him .
it would have been a mistake to leave them off too soon .
theodore blunt , was a spy .
he paused to consume more nourishment and then said in a slightly offhand voice : if dad turns up from time to time , youll look after him , wont you ?
do lets come out of here , david .
miss brewis , also , was not in evidence .
it has been coming on ever since weve been there .
it would particularly annoy an ultra respectable man like harold crackenthorpe .
he looked at her reflectively .
you dont know yet what an apt coincidence that was .
there it is on the floor by the window .
again godfrey burrows mechanical smile flashed out , and again it seemed slightly unreal .
hes afraid of me if anything .
not a lover of the picturesque or the antique , are you , bill ?
bantry grimly .
i am going to see her .
tell me one thing , monsieur giraud , said poirot suddenly .
cleaning up something .
i will assist you .
vii the gong sounded and i went in to lunch .
you mean , why did he leave it to blackie ?
i listened for a minute or two , then replied briefly .
price ridley glared at me suddenly .
he , too , had known doctors to be mistaken .
everyone was thrilled by flying .
he sighedthen rousing himself : come , hastings , let us hear what japp has to say .
she said quickly : yes , everything , i think .
fairly gives me the creeps sometimes .
madame olivier shook her head with a faint smile .
but nobodys supposed to know .
i had to send him down there to see about some crates of books that have come out for us .
she maynt have counted on a fatal accident .
but we do know something about him .
one was colonel melrose , the chief constable .
toxic polyneuritissomething like that .
he was silent for a moment and then said : tell me , this follower of yoursthis shadowof what age was he ?
or dealing out its golden handshake of good fortune ?
the money , is it yours or your husbands ?
i think dr .
there was a pickpocket oncei interested myself in him because for once in a way he had not done what they say he has doneand so i get him off .
are you trying to reconstruct the crime ?
he builds them for very rich people and they have to be people who want the right thing .
remember the womanish voice .
marshall at all this morning ?
can you guess it ?
no , what i am trying to get at now is this .
' that horrible dream !
youve got some other reason , havent you ?
oh , the riverand egyptand the way the light changes and the colours of the sand below and the rocks .
i am much attached to mrs .
the next witness called was thelma andersen .
i do recall her dimly though .
i would like to see her so much .
but you left the house at ten minutes to nineboth by your own statement and that of parker , and yet it was nine oclock when you passed through the lodge gates .
i think , he said , that that could possibly be managed .
nobody goes about kidnapping children and holding them up to ransom .
you know he never looks at girls as a rule .
i started at mademoiselle t .
castle creaked out of the room .
the wearing of wigs .
it provides an excuse for all sorts of doubtful doings .
farley , i should recommend napoleon ' s book of dreams - or the latest practising psychologist from harley street .
is it your poor child , my dear ?
the young lady carefully wiped the pistol with a handkerchief and then placed it in the pocket of a grey wrap , the property of mrs .
i suggest , elspeth , that i should travel up to london with you , and that we should travel down again as far as brackhampton in the train you travelled by the other day .
mrs pierce , the old liar , wasn ' t here , i found ' ' is that a frequent occurrence ?
i didnt dream for a minute anything was wrong .
raymond opened the drawer , took out a round leather collar box from the back of it , and opening it , drew out a thick wallet .
then he said : im sorry .
i gave instructions to my faithful georgethe most unobtrusive of men whom she did not know by sight .
i came back this term and i hoped that no one would ever know but you understand now , dont you , why i said i should have had to refuse your offer of a partnership if youd made it ?
what happiness had she ever had in her life up to now ?
probably met her once at a reception .
leopold was a solid , pudgy-faced boy entirely absorbed , it seemed , in mechanical construction .
if she continued down the stairs she would have to pass along the side of the house .
you are a woman who considers and weighs everything carefully .
emily arundells voice sounded sharp and interested .
she said : it looks like somebodys clothes !
and we will come out here in the moonlight and celebrate the rites of astarte .
there was a person under this roof who had already killed five times and who was preparing to kill again .
mr watts was going to build a house for his son on part of his land , and the young couple could settle down there .
robin , of course , was in his element .
i could clean the silverwe always cleaned our own silver photograph frames and bric-a-brac at homeand i could wait at table reasonably well .
some of those girl guides .
we went down to the symmingtons house after breakfast .
more things in heaven and earth , horatio , and so on and so on .
look at our norwegian friend .
i want those clocks in the sitting room packed up carefullyall except the cuckoo clock on the wall and the big grandfather clock .
the masked figures were sitting round the table .
then he went out to bridge .
take half , renisenb , and i will take the other .
forrester .
it would have been so easy , if she had had sleeping-stuff with her .
and , anyway , the alibi holds for both of them .
true , the warmth eased her rheumatism , but here in paradise nothing ever happened .
a man of great strength of character , van aldin already appeared to be his everyday , normal self once more .
drinking and card playing all the evening .
i mentioned to you , he said , she seemed to me a littleerstupid .
and then , figure to yourself , hastings , an idea of the most unreasonable seized this mr .
his granddaughter ?
the vicar nodded with complete comprehension and possible sympathy .
and your own name ?
i rang you up to know if you could possibly come overan imposition , i know , but i am really in great distress .
between thirty and fifty or so , and he worked for mr .
say , rather , to you .
i overheard a reference to them , and asked my uncle about it afterwards .
after the breakup of his second marriage , he probably thought it was the best thing .
by this time i was getting seriously worried about mademoiselle jane .
people want them just at the time of the wedding but nobody comes back to look for weddings in the past .
i meanyou meanoh , i see , you mean like jack the ripper or that other manwho was it ?
when matilda died , she left her money to be divided between emily and agnes , and when agnes died she left hers to emily .
she sighed and turned restlessly in her seat .
ecoutez , you are willing to divorce your wife ?
' ' no , i think not , ' m .
he felt all along that it was very admirable , but it had become the centre of her life .
you may be wrong there , blore .
meanwhile i had deliberately been nerving myself to prove how ridiculous my fancies were .
i should hand the wrong pass to the wrong person , and it would end in my being summarily shot by a bloodthirsty rebel , or one of the supporters of law and order whom i notice guarding the streets wearing bowler hats and smoking pipes , with rifles tucked carelessly under their arms .
he beamed at her .
i gave him misleading information .
i have sent it by air mail to gipsys acre .
i was following someone else , the person who met her .
seemed a pity not tounique opportunityprobably the only time ill be mixed up with anything of this kind .
well , it was nothing definite , but yesterday afternoon we were just touching on sir hugo de chevenix (who , im afraid , didnt bear too good a character in the wars of the roses) , and sir gervase said , my sister would choose the family name of hugo for her son !
oliver , and that is really why i asked m .
its usually the best place to find you , isnt it ?
knew his stuff , too .
well , yes , i suppose that might have been it .
i dont know her at all , said bess sedgwick bitterly .
now , maam , is that true ?
he was a contradictory man .
she thought again , gratefully , i have come home .
he paused , then lowering his voice , he went on : mostly a dried up lot of sticks in this hotel !
im off duty from four to half past .
hes an ass .
all life is a jest , imhotepand it is death who laughs last .
the fair girl took up the saga .
someone sneaked in there and retrieved the pistoljacqueline de belleforts pistol , remember .
this is what her highness will wear to open the bazaar , explained the old lady , holding up a daring creation of white and black .
and thats whats frightening the life out of me .
she strolled round the gardens which would be the normal thing to do .
had i good evidence on both those points ?
it was some time before i could interrupt the flow of words , and say with icy coldness : it is very kind of you , mr s .
there were pencilled entries in a sloping foreign writing .
you seem very sure about it all , said anthony .
eh bien , that ought to keep mrs .
if you look at his picture just over his chair , although its of him when he was much younger , its exactly like him now .
i shall have , i think , to consult miss arundells lawyer .
she came in at six oclock .
it was a dark overcast night , no stars .
van dylans house .
after greetings , he solemnly drew out his notecase , extracting three pound notes , added three shillings and pushed them across the table to miss marple .
she had bade me goodbye , and i was therefore somewhat surprised to find her in this room apparently gazing in rapture at my cabinet of fans .
and then theres angell .
then , seated on a boulder .
one hopes to present a good appearance .
i know , sir .
we must get to business , he said briskly .
miss marple , though throwing a kindly and indulgent smile at the past , did not object to the amenities of the present .
there were trunkfuls and drawers full of things eaten by moth , their usefulness ended .
i suppose in next to no time tommy and i will be living in one !
hinted danahan doubtfully .
everything she ate and drank was proved and tested .
its very easy to pick wrong leaves looking alike , bunch em all up together and take them into the kitchen ; you wouldnt , i think , make them reallyi mean , not reallytoo lethal .
shes clever , you know .
haydock had gone back into smugglers rest , and closed the door .
its amazing the way girls can get on in the world .
we spent four days of luxury at the hotel , and then had to look about for something cheaper .
you shall do your duty !
josephine , her face partially obscured by a very large apple , was standing in the opening of the yew hedge looking at me .
superintendent battles compliments and would it be convenient for mr .
do you think i ought to carry a small pistol about with me ?
now , mon vieux , to the real commission .
his family and mine lived next door to each other .
audrey has too much pride .
he dared not let his eyes stray too often in the direction of mrs .
charles gave a sudden schoolboy wrigglea rather disarming action .
but theyre all right .
well , sir , to tell the truth i didnt know what to do .
you are wrong , hastings .
she went over to the writing-table , dashed off in her big , unformed handwriting : the countess of horbury presents her compliments to mr john robinson and will see him if he calls at eleven oclock tomorrow morning ii will i do ?
said miss bulstrode .
theres poor old jackie dead and not able to know about it .
the young lady stopped exclaiming at the bluebells and suddenly confided in mr .
why , yes , it was lennox i was thinking of .
as you say , one mustnt waste thoughts on the guiltyits the innocent who matter .
youre sure these were the only two clocks in the room this morning ?
and then the others , the silks and the velvets , the ruffled shirts of the men , real lace , i noticed , several timesand the plush and the hair and the luxury of avant garde , the luxury of the eighteen-hundreds or you might almost say of the elizabethan age or of van dyck pictures .
you were engaged by an elderly lady to obtain a post here and to search the house and grounds for a dead body ?
surely nofret would wish no evil to my father ?
but had he , perhaps , embarked on some transaction for which he had not had proper authority ?
if it is sowhat does it mean ?
she added in a different tone of voice , i wonder what the woman was like who was murdered .
where did you live before ?
a letter arrived , written in one of those clear and yet somewhat illegible handwritings that stamp the professional man .
poirot , who came .
and she reads a lot of clever books , they say .
he stood aside to allow the newcomer to enter the drawing-room , and then said , would you wait here , sir .
i cant keep it any longer .
parker pyne , recovering from the stupefaction that had descended upon him .
and that seemed to amuse her .
is this murder the work of some rival gang whom cassetti had double-crossed in the past , or is it an act of private vengeance ?
yeswell ?
down below i heard the sound of a door shutting .
perhaps you will .
im sorry , she said in a low voice .
but the younger generation seem to find all this terribly attractive .
ive rung up the police .
yes , bring her in .
about half past twelve , sir .
yes , hes an awful fighter .
he laid a deferential hand on her shoulder .
theyre rather a nuisance , reallyat least he is .
i dont think youve followed the thing to its logical conclusion , my dear miss eyelesbarrow .
nothe power i dreamed of was absolute !
no reason to put a cooking recipe in a secret drawer otherwise .
there was a certain amount of the gamin element in the girl , at all events she invariably got on well with small boys .
major barry said appreciatively : good-looking fillies , some of em .
they were just stupid things .
their faces turned to him .
it was , he felt , the house of a dream .
from what you have told me , i gather that sir charles and miss lytton gore went together to interview mrs .
he remembered now .
you like nuts .
you can speak for all the members of the family ?
he said softly : do you then desire this work of art so much ?
the performer laid the instrument down again .
you didnt think it was a likely thing for her to do ?
emmott were going to put in some work on the pottery until mr .
youre quite sure about it , arent you ?
ah , if there were a substance that could do what is claimed for the calabar bean .
if youve lost , youve lost .
when was he there ?
she noticed something rather peculiar in my expression , and said : you are staring at me !
and she was prettyyes ?
i never presently you shall say all you want to say .
had to be put away though .
there doesnt seem to have been much attention paid before .
the former dropped his voice a little .
she didnt keep a diary .
only i do not see .
but they never do !
poor dear , hes getting quite an old man now .
jim pearsons fiance .
it was hard to associate him with positive action of any kind .
ii really dont remember .
i mused , won over to poirots views for the moment , although still retaining a faint conviction that the obvious deduction was the correct one .
first of all , where will the sacred formula be tonight ?
i have retired .
whats happened to the picture your husband showed me ?
our nurses , i gathered , were friends .
the clocks were wrapped up and paid for .
the main facts i know , of course , but recount to me the whole story , monsieur , i beg of you .
what possible meaning could lie behind those simple words ?
ive known juries time and again bring in verdicts dead against the judges summing up .
but what does it mean ?
as she made to draw it away , he caught it , raised it to his lips again .
youll knock all the other girls into a cocked hat .
why , when i first mentioned the longridge farm case , you knew all about it .
we agreed it was best that i should take a dislike to her , pretend jealousy of her .
very soon another of them would go but it wouldnt be william henry blore .
part of a prescription , he noted , containing digitalin .
as we entered the hall , mrs .
that was all the patients this morning .
particularly she used to go to children when they were ill .
he would join me there in augustand when punkie came we would leave rosalind with her and go abroad .
wren and a flurry of snow came in together with a rush .
' poirot nodded , and re-entered the library , the butler following .
as you said , m .
it was almost a whisper , admitted margery .
and you sat down and resumed play ?
how clever you are .
oh that , said mrs .
who would look after me if anything happened to you ?
condemned to death .
first catch your hare as mrs .
its absurd , said lady sedgwick sharply .
there was a little fact i had already notedthe fact that mr boynton had replaced his mothers wrist-watchthat was capable of two explanationsit might have been a cover for the actual deed , or it might have been observed and misinterpreted by mrs boynton .
eight hundred !
no chance of ever going outside again .
he pointed a thumb upwards .
harper , the secretary , a pleasant lean young man wearing the national insignia of horn-rimmed spectacles .
it is odd here ?
i remembered (very dimly) my own supersensitiveness at eustaces age .
somewhere where there is sun and not too many english people .
colonel race followed her example .
he had never seen dorothy quite like this .
don ' t trust anybody !
her voice shook a little .
yes , we dined together .
i thought you said she was rolling in money .
in the meantime , miss chilcott , will , i am sure , tell you anything you want to know .
perhaps he had been mistaken .
ah , these are dreadful times !
sir henry said : have you ever seen the original of the photo about the hotel ?
then the widow apparently gets the lotor a life interest at any rate .
her attitude was natural and peaceful .
presently , however , we saw that food was being served in the saloon .
i cant say i enjoyed dispensing as much as nursing .
wilsons room , and took the bottle of tablets .
that was a mention of mrs .
she stopped to trace them with a forefinger , and got a word here and there whoever .
her contempt rang out .
it seems such ages since firbank , she said .
it couldnt be !
later , the same day , she came to the house in which miss moncrieffe lodges .
seemed as though there must be something in it !
sorry i cant help you , pollard .
parker pyne in a cheerful , matter-of-fact voice .
who do you mean ?
we had a case of tetanus in our first batch of patients .
as far as we know , she was quite alone during the time .
it would be in keeping with what the inspector was beginning to learn of his character .
richard said that that would take a long time to explain , and mrs .
neither do i believe it , mademoiselle , said poirot gently .
he issued orders .
at the prospect of danger , janes spirits rose .
' poirot repeated word for word the scene between himself and lady julia .
you are very useful to me , george , he murmured .
and theres been no funny business of any kind since youve been living here ?
on my mind ?
the truth is you wanted to forget all about her .
she ' s mislaid an attache-case and can ' t remember where she had it last .
she had scarlet lips , blackened eyelashes , and a platinum-blonde head .
he was graceful , debonair , perfectly dressed , extremely handsome .
five little pigs ( _num_ ) a staggering bestseller upon its publication running through _num_ , _num_ copies of its first edition five little pigs (published in the u .
hilary thought , perhaps the plane will crash .
or , of course , it can be as simple as having an unfortunate love affair .
i dont want him to suffer .
bess sedgwick threw a swift glance round .
it was most obvious .
to her father confessor , to her hairdresser and to her private detectiveif she trusts him .
when the pictures finished ill tell caroline the truth and well get the whole messy business cleared up .
dont look stupid .
the suns gone in .
it is possible , perhaps , he suggested , that there are old family letters and documents in this misserlawsons possession ?
any word for an old friend ?
that is not the difficulty .
you must be .
it dated from the last warhad been revived for this one .
oh , l , l , we seem to have changed places , you and i .
he was of middle height , and squarely built to match his jaw .
indeed , a much more awful prospect confronted him .
get some sleep .
if only it were doyle i had got to deal with that is what he was thinking .
the climax came quicker than he expected .
someone who has had at heart the sole object of proving you insane .
but its perfectly all right .
she shook her head , smiling a little at that .
very few girls nowadays seem to be able to make a bowl of cornflour nicely .
do you know those long pink bladders that are sold at fairs with faces painted on them called dying pigs ?
poirot realized with a momentary flicker of amusement that he had not made himself popular by his critical attitude .
emmott .
quite a fine warm night , he said .
i to you offer two thousand .
what is your opinioni beg your pardonthe opinion of the servants hall of the secretary ?
we may get to know them any minute .
what a pigheaded old devil you are .
therefore it must have been mrs .
he said : speeds come to stay .
very natural , said the inspector and poured himself out another cup of tea .
when i urged her to send for a friend she promised to do soand suppressed the fact that she had already sent for mademoiselle maggie .
no papers , no hints of any kind as to where the money came from that she and her cousins had , no record of whom they had dealings with .
miss daphne theodofanous .
looks a bit fishy to me , said japp .
well there is this : according to jane mason , at bristol , flossie was no longer alone in her carriage .
i hate leaving you but you feel you ought to go , murmured tuppence reminiscently .
he stretched out his hands .
that particular part of the country was bare enoughrocks , heather and bracken , but about a hundred yards from the house there was a densely planted grove of trees .
ive been practising with a lasso in my spare time , sir .
do you think there may have been foul play ?
this time it was as though something heavy had fallen with a thud against the door .
in fact you are quite certain of her guilt .
a certain amount of building done round about in victorian times .
i do not break my word , said simone coldly .
i realized the significance of this .
poirot , im not incriminating myself .
to join the other victims , i suppose ?
what kind of a bottle ?
if it is my turn , said sir henry , and i suppose it is , as im sitting next to miss helier , i want a good deal .
and see what steps her brother took .
i believe , you know , that these sneak thieves meet the boats and if the people are flustered or seasick they go off with some of the suitcases .
he rang the bell for two of the servants .
you cant carry six cats as well as fifty wooden animals round with you .
poirot , dontdont joke about these things .
i had been rather intrigued by a man who had got out of our train at bolzano , and had been met by a private car .
why did you never tell us about it ?
it seems she made sure miss carlisle would marry mr .
redding goes to the vicarage , leaving it as late as he dares .
maverick advanced upon edgar with a kind of professional zest .
as he saw that i was noticing him , he gave a short , plaintive yelp , looking from me to the table .
i dont know of anyone definite .
i know , said jessop , thats the stumbling block .
so very convenient in fiction .
what on earth am i going to say to the jeffersons ?
his thoughts broke off at a sound below stairs .
and to think i never suspected pagett for a minute until the night he tried to throw you overboard .
the big bush that i had noticed by the wall stopped being a bush .
it has been a great pleasure to know you , said the canon .
well sir ronald thought a moment , were all agreed on the main things , he said slowly .
she struggled with a recalcitrant clothes peg , then turned her head as she heard someone approaching .
i shall ring up the chief constable myself and say so .
s-s-so i thought , went on badger , that id give you a little s-s-s-surprise , dont you know ?
you know why i suggested it ?
chair , sheila ?
there are other explanations besides that of imbecility , i remarked .
demanded cherry .
it must be the one belonging to the woman with whom he has just collided .
there was a strange expression on poirots face as he stood looking down on her .
catherines was popish .
i explained that my mother had kept various things of my fathers in an old sea chest .
if i could remember some of the stories about those days that richard told us at one time or another .
vandemeyer also rose to her feet , her eyes flashing .
he has party manners when he is asked out to dinner , explained tuppence .
a devoted mother to her children , a dutiful wifebut her manners , sometimes , are hardly what they should beto the head of the house .
she said : do you remember after the last warwhen we were hunting down mr .
davids haste , his excitementhis fierce , almost angry , lovemaking .
hardly , said poirot .
they turned in through some imposing gates where a commissionaire was standing on duty in a military manner and drove up a drive flanked with rhododendrons .
it used to be called swallows nest , said tuppence .
was miss pebmarsh in the house then ?
as soon as he had done so , and withdrawn again , the princess poporensky remaining in attendance , a rapid exchange of garments took place .
i dont know what id do without you .
still , i suppose it might have happened quite easily .
and suddenly , without warning she broke down , dropping her face down upon her outstretched arms and crying as though her heart would break .
it was just after half past eleven that he brought the car to rest in the road adjoining the park of chimneys .
no sending in of bills that you know wont ever be met .
it was still quite dark , but i knew that dawn was not far off .
he reached home in a mood of pleasurable excitement .
poor captain underhay (or is it major underhay) may be a prisoner somewhere in the dark interior of africa .
she will do it , perhaps , even if you were not dallying with her .
but you cant believe all you hear .
tastes .
yesterday she left england as arranged , for casablanca .
' ' yes , i think you ' re right .
i see theyve got the announcement of gordon cloades death in the times , he said .
more than once ive unearthed a nasty scandalbrought it into the open .
the whole thing took place whatonly five days ago .
if they persisted , it meant that they were willing to come out into the open against him .
he said it lightly , with a slight smile .
it is that there are moments when a great longing for my friend hastings comes over me .
mastertons deep voice .
and i want to impress one thing on your minddont let anybody know that youve told me what you have .
youve grown a lot thinner , havent you ?
we will briefly consider mrs waverly .
you think douglas gold would have followed her ?
you might .
but you havent got my worries .
what matters is the now , the present .
its closed until two oclock .
he left me here without a single drop to drinknot a drop of water not lemonade , nothing at all .
perhaps a thought too clever .
i dont see what more i can do .
the facts , unfortunately , were public property .
she shot me a cunning sideways glance .
ronny sprang up .
bundle , he knew , had to make a big detour by the lodge gates , and through the village .
max had planned the honeymoon entirely himself : it was going to be a surprise .
edwards came discreetly along the terrace and paused at marks elbow .
will thinking tell you what it was this woman could have said if she lived ?
as miss marple went out of the room , sergeant lake said : shes old , but shes sharp .
greta was different .
got any further ?
the sound of a motor being driven at great speed was heard through the open window .
it made me afraid .
he went over to the instrument , just as christopher wren said shrilly , hes very handsome , dont you think so ?
send in major despard , said superintendent battle .
true enough , after dinner , a note was brought .
he told her that he was going , when he married her , to turn over a new leaf .
they were really very amiable .
better take it easy for a day or two .
our neighbours , the fletchers , at hoodown , had to sell their place and it is now a youth hostel .
it is bigger than his .
he added : ive got to see miss darnley again .
you are aware , madam , that thereby you may be sacrificing an advantage ?
harpercollinsebooks .
hes a better chance than we have , you know .
you havent told me your name .
from my aunt , m .
he said : it looks to me as though augustus shared these criminal tendencies we were speaking of just now !
vera explained the circumstances of her secretarial engagement .
im afraid it doesnt sometimes , said mrs .
parker pyne was apparently staring into space .
groans and a blood-curdling yell and sinister footsteps and i dont know what .
wellyesi did but ive nothing really to go upon .
you will recall yourself to her memory as having travelled to england by air on a certain occasion .
i am afraid , he said , that you are trespassing .
so i never really heard any details .
vincent , said tuppence , in her soft voice , as she sat down and took up mr .
certainly not , my dear .
therefore there must be retribution .
i dont quite see , hastings confessed .
i saw something else on your facethe thing that i told you this afternoon men try to conceal .
oh my dear , but thats just that youve been asleep .
yes , and cheap , too .
i told her i didnt know where youd gone exactly or when youd be back , but she said shed wait .
the attics of the elvaston square house were used as storage rooms for odds and ends of furniture , and a number of trunks and suitcases .
i was afraid i might be late and keep you waiting , said tuppence gently .
thats just the puzzling part of it , said sir charles .
is mr .
those were good daysgood days .
having given their own names and addresses to the inspector , who appeared to disbelieve utterly in frankies , they themselves were allowed to leave tudor cottage and with the assistance of the inspector succeeded in gaining admission to the seven stars in the village .
thats what he was trying to say to me .
we could all tell that .
akibombo bowed politely to all and left the room .
our friend , king victor , seizes on thatdifficult to prove a death of that kind .
something of that kind , i believe , said tuppence , feeling it safer to stick to that version , though in her mind apologizing to the ghost of mary jordan .
even though we display thereby the genius that is akin to madness .
the attraction of opposites .
it was the impression he had given in the dock .
i told him that i had had lung trouble , and that it had recurred more than once , but that a final treatment in a sanatorium some years ago had , i hoped , quite cured me .
eleven dinner with bill bundle set out to keep her appointment with bill on the following evening full of expectation .
he might have been drowned or pushed down a sewer .
mechanically , quite naturally , lady angkatell murmured : thank you , gudgeon .
poirot said : i know what it was you thought .
yes , continued japp , everybodys got to be searched , whether they kick up rough or not ; and every bit of truck they had with them has got to be searched tooand thats flat .
death very simplea fall down the stairs .
rudd , he said , i think youre more likely to understand my meaning than your wife is .
if you did have fingerprints , would it help ?
i myself will have some sirop de cassis .
rosaleen stepped back a pace and said admiringly : thats a lovely little heifer youve got in the top field .
if it was an accident .
a refined lady , i explained , is naturally unacquainted with bad language .
these girls of nowadays but that is because i grow old , said poirot to himself .
the one person who was entirely on my side , and reassured me in all that i was doing , was my brother-in-law , james .
i should say that of ones output , five books are work to one that is real pleasure .
poirot had not been going to say anything of the kind .
her lips were blue and her hand had gone to her heart .
naturally , but im not over sanguine as to the result .
wait while i turn the big light on and you shall feast your eyes on the ugliest necklace in england .
yes , said battle approvingly .
of course i looked up from my book from time to time , but as it happened the sea was quite bare each time i did so .
for the first time , cleveland saw the face of the girl who had been sitting with her back to him , and saw that , in a totally different way , she was quite as beautiful as her sister .
shed left her gloves behind .
you dont know everything , benny , he said , sounding hurt .
one looks for humanity in these matters , does one not ?
in fact , i think your friend rather resented my coming .
i cant prove it yetbut i know .
i only know what ive been told .
he looked at miss bennett who stood staring at richard warwick in his wheelchair .
but thenoh !
the germans occupied france .
he went quickly across and discovered mr .
there seemed to have been some faulty staff work resulting in overlapping .
then i am right ?
sport appeared with far more prominence than it had ever had in the old days .
why dont you like greta ?
then he came in , shutting the door behind him .
hercule poirot , having nothing better to do , amused himself by studying her without appearing to do so .
i should be very much surprised .
george said she was .
anyway , this de sousa fellow couldnt have had anything to do with all thisdont tell me he lands here off a yacht and goes straight away through the woods and kills a wretched girl guide in a boathouse !
you cant remember much about it , surely ?
though he had seen this particular man only once before , his keen memory was not at fault .
the prima donnas farewell performance wont be in it with yours , poirot !
she had to be smuggled out of court afterwards .
think were as green as to do you in here , and have the police nosing round ?
the veiled lady _num_ .
nicholas married her in the cathedral at ekarest with a couple of unwilling archbishops to do the job , and she was crowned as queen varaga .
i think theres something fishy about her .
in fact , she wont say anything at all .
we ought to have made you do something connected with murders .
mitchell or i must have taken the cup and saucer along that wayas i say one does sometimes what with the hurry and all .
she wrote over _num_ novels , short story collections and plays , and her books have sold over a billion copies in english and another billion in _num_ foreign languages .
poirots good opinion .
the inspector turned to him .
i was just coming to mr .
the second was a young man of the modern school .
he made his decisions quickly without beating about the bush .
this passive life suits me admirably , my friend .
and she has taste , tooalthough im not quite so sure of that as i was .
probably prussic acidin the cigarette , said mr .
she walked over to the doll , lifted her carefully , and crossed the room with her .
but the green light was very lovely where the sunlight came filtering through the trees .
colin looked at him quickly .
she followed him up to miss gilchrists room .
captain hastings .
we set out towards the house , flora and blunt walking ahead .
you are all going to a dance , are you not ?
and she said , i dont knowive never really been sure .
shes got a leaning towards the occult , i believe .
november _num_ nd , said poirot .
he , himself , would probably be in the library .
pritchard , please .
lucia looked at him with an imploring eagerness .
much better come and eat something .
says that the engagement is off !
you might meet your fate .
who is there who could wish to harm your wife ?
she said thoughtfully , father was clever .
a second interview with colonel arbuthnot _num_ .
his system , i practise it always .
that dished him !
its an unsolved crime again now , you see , said philip .
i did the same to you and disparaged her as a weak , helpless creaturemoira , who had the nerve to put any number of people out of the way without turning a hair !
the boy motif still predominated .
he wasdifferent .
shes got ginger hair and smells when shes hot .
sued by your dressmaker ?
mcgintys mind , but she did hope , perhaps , for a nice little present , as a reward for holding her tongue about a piece of bygone gossip which would not have been pleasant for a proud woman like mrs .
a very extraordinary thing , he repeated sneeringly .
it suits lady stubbs now and then to play the helpless nitwit if she doesnt want to do anything .
victoria caught a glimpse of herself in the glass .
the well-known explorer .
a young fellow has only to come to this country just before war starts and whine a bit about persecution , and they shut both eyes and let him into all our secrets .
i have been very fortunate in my profession .
equal benefits .
i havent got it .
it sounded so respectable and unfishy .
airmen !
the whole place looked as though it had recently been savaged by a gang of hooligans .
send georges out for all the others .
she is only half english , and , i suspect , has asiatic blood in her veins .
a wife is ill , and she is a human being , and that is what matters .
you didnt expect that .
only open your door if both blore and i speak to you .
i remembered , too , janes easy reference to bumping him off .
she used her discretion as to the sums she lent and the methods of repayment ; but i may tell you that she had her own methods of getting paid .
she used it as a fan , slowly tilting her wrist to and fro .
geronimo struck an attitude as he thought .
a small mandarkwith a womanish voice , said poirot thoughtfully .
the thorn would be bound to be found anyway .
all right , i dont want you to have to look in there at the body now , so just stand in front of the panel when it opens .
at last i went in .
the infantile riff-raff ran alongside murmuring plaintively : bakshish ?
he had noticed that , of late , she had a strained , worried look , and it was more apparent than ever this afternoon as she poured out the tea at the little marble-topped table .
one held complete faith in dr brewers childs guide to knowledgea counterpart of our modern quiz .
david went on as though he had not heard her .
eight (extracts from the diary of sir eustace pedler , mp) it is an extraordinary thing that i never seem to get any peace .
she listened to her friends eager and incoherent conversation , trying to gauge when to nod admiringly , when to shake her head in sympathy .
im glad of that .
gold looked gratefully at pamela and sat down near her .
her eyes had a stricken look in them .
a snack perhaps .
but it is not all right .
of how she had escaped and of her fortuitous meeting with richard baker , and of how she had claimed to be victoria pauncefoot jones on her way to the excavations , and of how she had almost miraculously sustained the part of an archaeological student arriving from en gland .
i might have killed simon last night ; i was mad , i think .
she seemed determined to know all about it and this george , ever doubtful of female discretion , was determined at all costs to avoid .
standing by the mantelpiece was an elderly man , with slightly stooping shoulders , who was introduced to us as dr .
years ago she told me that every woman should always have fifty pounds in five-pound notes with her in case of what she called emergencies .
the children and their mothers or friends left , and joyce could not be found .
yes , one always has them .
she didnt know anyone down here .
he had been infatuated with elsa , but it was all over .
gladys nevill said : thats why i came to you , m .
but must i be bothered nowso soon ?
as though she had read his mind she used the word that he had spoken to himself .
egerton stood looking at the door that had closed behind her .
i discovered her murderer .
probably the box was posted by then .
the girl beside him sat equally silent , not moving .
an aged mariner guarded them , a roll of blue paper in his hand .
lady codrington divorced codrington , citing arlena stuart .
however could i go to bert ?
after all , that would only have put whoever it is even more against us .
can you swim at all , anne ?
mcgillicuddy approached emma and murmured , in an anguished voicethe anguish was quite genuine since mrs .
sweep away the old order !
well , she cant be innocent .
(that miserable dennis !
also , as all the dressings looked extremely dirty , although actually surgically clean (they had been baked in the steriliser downstairs) it made it very puzzling .
for all practical purposes , that is to say , she was not a woman at all .
twenty-five years since hed seen her and shed been a pretty young girl when she went off with that chap , and now hed hardly have known her , grown so stoutand so arty-crafty in her dress !
he was warned , of course , about making a statement .
you can ask , yes .
quarter , hercule poirot found no difficulty at all in dealing with the coroner for the district .
the old man had a look .
its beyond all limits , she cried .
hes a canadian , you know , and i often think canadians are so touchy .
there had been a time when i had been surprised to learn that the blackness of poirots hair came out of a bottle .
said peters .
he came along the counter towards tuppence , looking at her questioningly .
ive often regretted it .
well write to miss packard and fix a day .
he told me an interesting thing about french windowsa trick that could sometimes be employed if the fastening was sufficiently loose .
and midnight .
i dont think i am now .
they come nosing around , sniffing around like the rats they are .
stop agreeing with me , mark .
but the passion for respectability is very strong .
miss marple chatted about the incidents of the tour in so far as she had been on it .
its just this .
roberts was indicated .
who do you mean by they ?
thats what set the police on him , of course .
as nice a set of ladies and gentlemen as you could wish to see .
on the whole mary dove was satisfied with her appearance .
i think , as the years went on , and he didnt hear , and kelvin halliday persisted in his delusion and finally committed suicide , that a terrible doubt began to creep up in his mind .
the voice of his daughter .
inside the gates , to the right , was a small lodge .
she was a pretty , dark-haired woman , and appeared perceptibly nervous .
go back and sit down , he said .
yes , i do remember something quite a long time ago .
he nodded with sudden finality .
cried the lady of shalott .
(did tommy know of connection between him and amy gibbs ?
i think theres going to be a storm .
devilish business , getting old .
lee began shouting at us all .
during the time that i was in the study mrs eurydice spragg would have had plenty of time to extract the envelope from the coat pocket and read its contents and , as a matter of fact , finding the envelope on the ground and not in the pocket seemed to point to her having done so .
well , sir do tell me , rose .
thats fine .
miss brewis had intimated that lady stubbs knew very well what she was doing .
if i have any impertinence from you , said derek quietly , you go out by that window .
she didnt answer at once .
yes , you see , the body was found in their house .
why shouldnt we all be friends together ?
her husband was shot as a traitorshes got every incentive for running a fifth column show in this country .
you have really no idea who the writer may have been ?
you must admit yourself its a crazy setup .
because of the dyed hair .
they had been fellow guests at a very strange dinner partya dinner party that had ended in death for that strange man , their host .
poirot switched to another point .
suddenly with a stifled exclamation victoria sat bolt upright and her daydreams were a thing of the past .
vivian dubois would have been scared and adele fortescue would have lost her head .
yes , he is clever , number four .
the room is not too hot , no ?
do you know , sir arthur , what we found clasped in the dead ladys hand ?
he merely shook his head doubtfully .
he threw a glance of deep reproach at miss lemon .
swettenham .
but , all the same , i think father lavigny was puzzled by her andwellalmost annoyed by being puzzled , if you know what i mean .
seeno , he replied , but she heard something .
i am clumsy .
drake looked unimpressed .
the papers were in this , monsieur , she said .
we are only considering possibilities .
no , no , said carrie louise , smiling .
oh , no , no , i cant believe it of him !
hullo , grandma , shouted andrew .
of courseid no idea she was a relation of richard abernethies !
over at ashevale , for instance , theyve got a lovely lot of new houses , some of them with green roofs and stained glass in the windows .
after our recent conversation , he gave dinner to my tuesday , but journey and country were answered by ship and uganda , showing clearly that it was his journey abroad that was important to him and not the one which brought him down here .
women usually do .
he seems to have got some very extraordinary ideas .
oh , yes , youre right .
fane to an asthmatic spaniel whose liquid eyes burned with greed .
of course , when you got home and realised you had parted with the two library books you had just fetched and were looking forward to reading , profering them to her eagerly because she sighed and said she had nothing to read , and not even grudging the fact until later , you realised what a remarkable woman she was .
the greatest interest was aroused by their discovery .
with a rather grim face , major burnaby inserted the key into the front door and passed into the empty house , evans at his heels .
colonel weston called upon us soon after lunch .
only a couple of months !
he would see a notice board on an iron gate .
its kind of you to take my future so much to heart !
scott to consider .
and she looked down at the sheer drop to the sea below and shuddered .
miss waynflete was leaning forward towards her .
this desert scene is rather fun , dont you think ?
and so , i suppose , i wasnt really surprised at her coming to a sticky end .
i pointed this out to the police , and they took the other one away with them .
if there were only someone near at hand , groaned the prima donna .
it was delicately panelled in pale wood and there were some enormous stuffed chairs upholstered in pale buff leather .
here he learnt that victoria had not returned .
what are they looking for , the revolver ?
poor dear old maggie .
he had met her before on the occasion of a problem to be solved in one of the balkan capitals .
i am sorry to say i detest mrs .
what happened when you had all arrived back at the house ?
must have run off the main road somewhere , he explained .
she couldnt put archdeacon simmons off because she didnt know where he was .
i saw from miss richs clever sketches how easy it is for a woman to alter her appearance by purely external matters .
you knew .
then she murmured , seemingly to herself , i wonder where she is ?
they were both running hard .
mrs boucher managed to bring me down to earth rather quickly .
and you dont like to leave no , i dont quite , said bobby .
oh , thank you , gudgeon .
i suppose i look simply frightful , she said to herself and approached the looking glass .
good , then , you are spotted from the first , and they do what i had counted on their doinga mathematical certainty to anyone who uses his grey cells properlyuse you as a decoy .
a comfortable tray with a big potbellied teapot , creamy-looking milk , a silver hot water jug .
father lavigny declared his intention of going round outside the house to the place where mrs .
you did not see mrs .
in fact i think i nudged her very gently in the ribs .
the most crashing collection of old bores .
she added in an undertone .
david and rosaleen arrived last .
she looked bored enough now , her face over his shoulder where he couldnt see it .
on the right was a sofa and a couple of chairs with some magazines on a table .
i wish id thought of ringing her up and giving her a fright .
and finally there is the one you have just mentioned .
yes , said lejeune .
theres theres blood and oh do come !
that woman contaminated everyone she met .
since his godmother , norah hewitt , could not be there , i was allowed to hold him and be proxy for her .
he had recognized where he was .
theyd only been here a month , you understand , when the thing happened .
not until now , when she had to decrease for the neck and count the stitches , had she realized the fact .
ah , you have come !
' ' the letters ?
parker pyne knew something of the properties of araq .
do you think why on earth should it be martine ?
he sat , solemn and stiff , blinking a little like an owl .
crale said : if youve any sense at all , youll realize that i dont paint portraits of pretty women .
parker pynes suitcases were loaded on the taxi in a somewhat haphazard manner , and they started off to drive round the island , trying cheaper hostelrics en route but with the final objective of formentor .
had he noticed anything ?
you are captain hastings , arent you ?
it wasnt so good later , she said , because ive never been able to spell very well .
i dont believe it , cried lily margrave .
i do hope it wont tire you too much .
eighty or even ninety thousand pounds will be much nearer the mark .
whats wrong with you ?
a pretty costume : i still have it (and wonder how i could ever have got into it) ; it is in the chest in the hall which is full of dressing-up things .
certainly , certainly .
i let you in on some pretty good cases in the old days , didnt i ?
anyone could have got into the pantry while you were absent ?
arent you in the habit of putting your car away at night ?
that does not look very good .
satterthwaite looked this way and that .
yesthat is to say , i believe i know how it was committed .
the other ends blocked completely .
and when i woke up i was in an arab house in a village over there .
my , but its lovely to see you .
ive always known it .
jefferson was so taken up with wasnt worth it .
and the other members of the staff ?
i wanted to see you very particularly , said george .
it was clear that the woman had thoroughly enjoyed herself .
the talk turns to crime , and joyce lemprire suggests that they form a club , to meet every tuesday evening .
' said poirot .
our danish girl has got no sense of time .
' ' he looked after them well - they were white and welt brushed ?
franklin rudge stared .
he had evidently been examining them .
im all right , said kay .
calgary prompted her .
i mean , perhaps you dropped it on the way up .
her grey hair had a slight natural wave and made a distinguished setting for an intelligent , resolute face .
poirot pressed his guest with refreshments .
he came over at once to nick .
poirot started a little .
well , its not really anything very much .
she could have cooked it herself but she hadnt had to !
i dont think i even knew what love was .
there was a ball in his mouth .
there was a cook and a house-parlourmaid as well as a nurse-attendant to look after old mr .
my husband was away from home attending some congress or other and i thought id have a tour round a likely part of the countrysidejust to see what there was going , and the kind of price one would have to pay , you know .
i tell you , i dont know !
asked margery bitterly .
the name above the shop , he noted , was neither mabberley nor kelso but hicks .
yes , she had a daughter .
and all of them are interested in birds .
the clothes must have been hidden ready .
lloyd .
susan said suddenly : how did aunt cora know about our marriage ?
its a far-fetched supposition , i suppose , but dering might have left paddington by the twelve ten trainarrived at exhampton some time after five , have killed the old man , got the six ten train and been back home again before midnight .
widburn was sitting .
ferrars business .
slack didnt find anything of the kind , and he asked redding , and redding didnt seem to know what he was talking about at first and then denied point blank using anything of the kind .
' ' what about the girls ?
you are cruel , said renisenb .
i was only there about two months .
and he departed abruptly .
i suppose it was rotten .
absolutely made for it , he agreed .

anthony regarded him with interest .
therefore we are exactly where we were before .
that , linda thought , was sensible .
we were at school together .
clarissa took the dish of chocolate mousse from pippa , placed it on the stool , and then sat on the sofa next to the child .
do you mean the house ?
but now i cant help wondering if i ought to have said something at the time .
but in these peculiar circumstances weve got to know why these people left it and where they went , and , also important , how they went .
the whole plot and action of the murder hunt seemed to him to be wrapped in impenetrable fog .
the veins stood out on his forehead .
she will know .
now , what is the first instinct of the criminal ?
but if so , where was hatties body ?
armstrong said : you went to the house for a rope .
it interested me why you should be there .
to keep knowledge to oneself at this juncture may be dangerousso dangerous that death may be the result of silence .
i think a lot of edward .
tanios , who was a big-bearded jolly-looking man , was talking to miss arundell .
i ran into that little chemist chap , osborne , down in much deeping .
hed told her that hed always been in trouble both with the police , and in every other way .
a little boy who died .
any more words of wisdom for me ?
had she got any special friend ?
a client of any kind ?
planned to break the journey in paris , and spend a couple of days routing up some old friends on the left bank .
sorrow and injury smoothed over too quicklyand festering poison beneath , ever swelling in a great tide of hate and venom .
his coat had been taken off to cover what lay below .
as a proof that it was expected the night before , i will mention that the bell in mrs .
they did so with the help of a chisel .
and i had a strange feeling that the problem was near solution .
do not take it amiss if i venture to make a surmise .
cornworthys room .
you said this man , hercule poirot , was a kind of stormy petrel , that where he went crimes followed .
did he do it , poirot ?
pilar nodded her head .
alex told her the police had taken it away .
number two and number three are so powerful , so high up , that they are for the present immune from our attacks .
i think they must starve them at these schools .
humfries in his office ?
i dare say he is a quackbut hes a damned successful one !
but in my opinion this person , whoever he may be , is not sane in the accepted sense of the word .
three a funeral funerals are rather sad , arent they ?
somebody tried to murder miss blacklock .
i dont really know about mr .
rather a suspicious attitude .
but , mademoiselle , the orient express leaves stamboul every day of the week .
lady coote was sitting on a garden seat doing woolwork .
hes a pillar of respectability and trustworthiness .
i felt suddenly that i had got into a primitive era .
he felt that the last words were unfortunate .
no one is to know , that is , until the erskines have left dillmouth .
and then i got that wound on the head .
you mean you dont care a damn about anybody else .
probably it was rather adventurouswe seemed to be flying into mountain peaks the entire time .
had there been a quarrel between them ?
she produced facts and figures to support her contention .
poirot come to any definite conclusion ?
the valet came forward .
i sign where i am told to sign .
emerson wrote to me about her from cambridge .
it came up easily , noiselessly .
the head of one and the feet of the other .
she always meant to come .
but i understood that it had been opened with a key ?
i can take up the point with her again some time .
nobody had noticed him come in .
babbington smiled and said , and the clergy , too ?
any christmas shopping i can do for you ladies ?
you told me that you thought of sailing ducks in it as soon as you saw it .
long-headed , you know .
for my own reading , the works of alexandre dumas in french now entranced me .
sergeant oconnor .
that is so , monsieurfrom persia .
the rooms were in the same corridor , two doors from each other .
i looked for the equivalent of the blonde stenographer and the soap boiler , and voil !
pity !
during the war , lady eileen , there was a great outcry about german spies being left at large .
ceilings leaking and all .
it was a wonderful concept , and the more i thought about it the more i was in favour of it .
and the diamonds i reflected .
since in the feelings of those living in baghdad it was arctic winter nobody else was out there except one of the waiters , who was leaning over a railing staring down into the water , and he sprang away guiltily when victoria appeared and hurried back into the hotel by the service door .
renisenb felt it necessary to say the word quietly and without protest .
on arrival at home , he found that battle had gone without leaving any message .
poirot sprang to his feet with sudden energy .
well , i had a sort of idea theyd come in handy .
she was in black , her face white and lifeless .
youve no earthly evidence of any kind .
poirot studied his white sude shoes ruefully .
if we have made a mistake he shrugged his shoulders forebodingly .
you should be talking to a scientist , said michael .
i understand she knew lady stubbs before she was married and it was she who urged on sir george to buy this place .
you can see for yourself , my lady , theres no place here as a cat could hide .
she paid and began to sip from her glass .
he was a little man whose moustaches were out of proportion to his size .
id like to be able to recognize him .
then you know who he is ?
she saw him give a rapid glance round and then slip quickly inside .
i think i shall go and buy that hat i told you about .
hell escape , said mr .
herewait .
in clearing alfred inglethorp , continued poirot , i have been obliged to show my hand sooner than i intended .
he looked at the rock with a kind of agonized passion .
its the rest of it .
im certainly willing .
thank goodness , we can have the place smartened up a bit nowget some labour-saving gadgets put inmake it right for you .
i wished to see if the door was really bolted on this side also .
yes , horshams been and said his piece , said colonel pikeaway , slowly allowing his eyes to close again .
i put a lot of makeup on my face i suppose it would be rude if i just put it down somewhere .
but thats how she felt about her job .
im terribly weak , you see .
it was , as gina had said , a vast edifice of victorian gothica kind of temple to plutocracy .
death was not , to him , amusing .
martin nor yet his good lady wont take it amiss if i comes for once on a wednesday instead of a friday .
then , somehow or other , she and raymond had drifted apart .
emmett had come to call and talk about the selling arrangements for poppy day , and how after the preliminary business had been settled , mrs .
george crossed towards the telephone .
what is the matter with the pram ?
on the facts as given there , only two persons had the opportunity of killing your husband , only two persons could have killed him major rich and major richs manservant .
it is balenciaga , isnt it ?
hehe was very queer .
there must have been a reason she stared at him .
her face broke upsuddenly , incredibly , he saw the girl of the picture .
twenty-three is the oldest i have ever imagined them .
she was said , according to my friends , to be very attractive .
you think the big four kidnapped him ?
what about your familyyou have a family ?
finally , rather angrily , he came back to the house .
but about these letterssteps must be taken at onceat once the great man puffed himself out and swelled importantly .
to this , we are told , her nephew responded , dont be too sure .
i suppose its possible , i said doubtfully .
at the door she took a hold upon herself and threw back her head .
miss lumley agreedmr .
osborne who had no connection with thyrza grey , no connection with bradley and birmingham , no connection with the victim .
he had in front of him a letter from the chief constable and another from some high official at scotland yard .
well now , theres another seven in there .
a woman with a certain amount of finesse , but who knows the baser side of life from bitter experience .
now are you sure that chair is quite comfortable ?
she lady tressilian stopped him with upraised hand .
butbut spence wagged a heavy forefinger .
a push perhaps on a dangerous spot .
carter , telling him when and where tommy had started on his quest , and asking him to do something to trace him .
now , what was his name ?
the door flew open and george challenger rushed into the room .
she hasnt any feminine feelings or weaknesses .
good , good .
chimneys , quite apart from its historic associations , is ideally situated .
sprot to rack her brains a bit ?
said it wasnt to be announced just yetbut gave us the hint that he was in the running for the benedick stakes .
leadbetter was informed that his nephew had called and would like to see him .
ill get her to write to you .
there was a vivid flash from the rails and a crackling sound .
there were only a few tablets left in the bottle .
as she went away from them down one of the inevitable white corridors , andy peters gave a low whistle .
youre such an intriguing person in many ways .
i said i had read about it .
she had set out the tea things ready on a tray , with sandwiches and bread and butter covered with a damp napkin to keep them moist .
sir gervase was perfectly easy to manage if one took him the right way .
mary asked : do you think mrs .
of course they woke him up .
i wish you would reconsider i cant .
married manfond of your missus and all that .
we are glad to know that you will be with us .
some maniac !
pierce talks in the little shop in the high street luke had bought a tin of cigarettes and todays copy of good cheer , the enterprising little weekly which provided lord whitfield with a good portion of his substantial income .
the clock ?
joe went ahead .
clark nodded .
the whole thing seems most mysterious .
im glad he didnt suffer .
and i wont have it , dyou hear ?
he stopped at once , delighted with the pleasurable spectacle that met his eyes .
no , i missed him by just about forty seconds , i should say .
a young policeman in plainclothes had followed the two men in unobtrusively and sat down a little distance away .
and was he a crook ?
no , miss amory told him .
but rather a helpless one , by all accounts .
she was standing just under a tall lamp .
i did make an appointment , but as things are but mr .
we saw a lot of messy-looking shacks , and then by good luck we found this .
what is it , mademoiselle !
nonot exactly .
and i had no chance of seeing the body , and there was no possibility of examining , or analysing , any medium in which the poison could have been administered .
our concern is not with the dead but with the living .
she has been a pretty girl and she keeps a photograph of herself to remind her of what a pretty girl she was .
my mother said good-bye and then added , whos the young lady that lives with you ?
but corrigan , tell me , couldnt it be as he said ?
oh yes , dont tell me that fellow hahn wasnt a german agent .
poirots methods with hildegarde schmidt were a complete contrast to his handling of mary debenham .
something like a very faint smile came to his lips but passed almost immediately .
it was a long pause .
the trams came to ealingand local opinion immediately erupted into fury .
and dont tell me shes one of our counterespionage either , because i dont believe that .
at that moment the mayor and his wife were approaching .
poirot endeavoured to change the subject .
he went out there , i believe , for his health .
hercule poirot was reviewing the evidence .
yes , a mademoiselle joanna southwood .
well spend two or three years together putting meadowbank back on the map .
hannibal turned his head and came and rubbed his nose against the calf of her leg .
she came at this time every year .
mademoiselle nick buckley , she would be of those who are always late and taking the short cut !
she was silent again , her face softened , her lips half-parted .
there was never any question of pretending to be letitia to dora .
victoria asked .
so many people confess to it , said colonel melrose .
did anybody see what you were doing whilst you were out cleaning the gutter ?
my doctor , he assures me that one dies not of itand it is for the one time only ; you understand , that nevernever shall i return .
he asked miss bunner .
she said : youyou seem to know all about it ?
she pushed back some dank hair from her forehead .
preferences in food and drink .
and i said id run out with it .
you think everything is fishy .
the navy ?
morley shot himself .
her hair was a natural golden blonde and she had a wide generous mouth that laughed easily .
her voice sounded depressed .
ferrars died on the night of the _num_ th _num_ th septembera thursday .
there are just different types of brains .
absolute young hooligans , thats what they are .
mr benedict farley ?
just to get her impressions of things , said poirot .
i parried that one , and she made half-hearted efforts to find out whom i knew .
ruby .
he watched her with curiosity , the sudden flicker of excitement , the hungry covetous eyesand then the flicker died .
eighteen _num_ oh , wally , how you startled me !
is it not a fact that nurse hopkins said she thought she had left the morphia at home ?
they didnt live there .
stiffly , carol moved across the bedroom .
asked colonel munro .
lazy golden sands .
griselda , however , explained that with the air of one who knew she was right .
do you deny that you were listening at that door ?
the lipstick she used was a pale rose colour .
and quite time , too .
she stood there tall and grim and grey-haired .
there , there , said wilbraham soothingly .
whose idea is it ?
but may i say , strictly in confidence , that there are some curious features about this business !
you travel very far and you dont know where youve been , but when you wake up , its to a totally new world .
dying !
she was first stunned by a blow on the back of the head .
macmaster , yes , i do again he cast a shrewd look at calgary .
rudd can spare you a few minutes now , miss marple , said hailey preston , appearing again by her side .
barton was really most peculiar about it .
tell her we can wait on her in her compartment if she does not wish to put herself to the trouble of coming here , called m .
on the table beside her , almost under her hand , lay a small , jewelled revolver .
not so funny when the lift goes out of order .
they could not have made it for the great city of nineveh , nearby , like some local swansea or wedgwood , for nineveh did not exist when they were moulding their clay .
no , i mean , i dont see who could have wanted to do it .
you go home and go to bed , he said .
elvira did not reply .
but you are disappointed ?
tell me about red teddy at the picnic .
scents affected him .
deliberate hands pushed that childs head down into water , holding her there till death occurred .
i cant think of anything i can possibly have seen , said rowena drake , but one never knows .
it is very clear , is it not ?
inspector bland considered for a moment or two .
by this will , said mr .
a fairly imperious woman .
whatever he may have felt on some former occasions , he had always managed to conceal the fact .
disillusioned , after his wifes death he returned to seek out his quiet cousin clara .
there is no special hiding place in the house ?
they cant tell .
result , she died a rich womanand the lawson woman gets it all !
she might have had a kind of spear in her hand and stabbed him at a distance , and then i suppose mass hypnotism comes into account .
the truth can only be seen from within .
you must be a millionaire by now , m .
she didnt come to us .
but yes , i noticed what you are thinking of .
i remembered id seen a late rose in bud in the border .
well , said sir charles , lets map out our plan of campaign .
he was too fond of children , i think , and it wasnt in a natural kind of way .
both he and van aldin had succumbed to slumber , when poirot , glancing for the fourteenth time at his watch , leant across and tapped the millionaire on the shoulder .
i dont know which of them all was the worst .
lansquenet wasnt at all well .
by the way , heres one little fact might interest you .
he didnt back the winner , though .
my godfather , sir henry clithering , told me that you once had a club here .
or is his animosity impersonaldirected against a foreigner ?
i hurried down the stairs after the others .
he began to poke about .
but they dont , you know .
it was really no trouble .
very wellwe dont think so either .
it was the last thing in the world they expected .
yes , yes , she , too , is a loyal friend .
isnt it funny ?
i think thatll do for the present , sister , said the little man , and the nurse left the room in a sort of brisk well-trained way .
i much appreciate your giving me this interview .
you remember how he fixed that toaster ?
the other smiled , a very tired smile .
very affectionate and sweet .
he clenched his hands again .
dark overcoat , gray hat , muffler round the neck .
apple trees , he saw , was a most admirably kept house .
wont a lighter do ?
she poured him out a cup of tea .
surely its harmless , isnt it ?
ce bon japp , said poirot .
oh , that strange brain , childlike and cunning .
i dont know at all .
the first thing i did was to redeem the wretched ring .
sir george at her right , bent also .
oh , dear , she said , dismayed , i dont believe the kettle can have been boiling .
i was tired of these mushrooms .
fish is a pinkertons man .
he tried to speak , but the words would not come .
he was full of enthusiasm .
stay where you are , all of you .
he smileda rather curious smile .
a verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown was returned , and the police (and the daily budget) were left to look for the man in the brown suit .
if you were fond of himwere you fond of him ?
im really looking forward to this trip , arent you , linnet ?
here among the small booths , he came to the opening of a khan , he stepped through the doorway into the court .
after a lapse of a minute or two parker appeared .
the window is then closed and bolted and the door unlocked .
fifteen the french stranger virginia and anthony walked side by side down the path which led to the lake .
well , he said , thats that !
so difficult , isnt it ?
now , then , who else is there ?
not only must there be nothing to connect him in any way with the dead man , but he must have a proper reason for being down here .
i wanted him rattled .
he cant speak french .
refuse ?
she looked frightened to death .
one likes trying new things .
if she met an ordinary-looking man and he asked her to come and look at something in the woods shed probably go like a lamb , quite unsuspecting and docile .
tina knows something that makes her suspect who did it .
richmond hadnt suspected .
very good , sir .
i just wonder if possibly there may have been a gapa very small onebetween the story he was telling meabout a manand the moment when he was getting out his wallet and sayinglike to see a picture of a murderer .
you know , hastings , it should be awfully simple to say when a things right or wrongbut really when it comes to it , it isnt quite such plain sailing .
and what do you want me to do , milady ?
lewis , the parlour-maid , came in and said : i am just going to ring the gong then broke off and exclaimed , why , louie , whatever are you doing ?
yes , romaine will tell you .
again the inspector stared hard at de sousa .
there was nothing to lead up to it .
not so very , said poirot .
someone whistling the tune of three blind mice .
youre talking like a thriller by a lady novelist .
one was inside the flat hung up in the kitchen and the other wasor should bein the maligned bag .
this gentleman put us on to him .
tell him its urgent .
tommy suddenly pointed with a shaking hand .
she will be returned from the motoring by then .
a moment later poirot heard the car drive away .
all through this , shes been splendidsplendid !
i know , but i thought it was better to get it over .
but , for the sake of your good sister , i am willing to give you the chance of another way out .
im worried , said bill .
i thank you , yes .
the automobile , it was being repaired , and he had to run for the station .
petherick explained to me very clearly , saying that , although the coronors jury had brought in a verdict of murder by a person or persons unknown , mr .
and below them : only a month ago england was shocked and startled by the murder of a young girl , elizabeth barnard , at bexhill .
and who it is behind them , urging them on ?
look here , she said .
miss martindales eye consulted the clock on her desk .
christow was shotaccording to the medical evidenceonly a minute or two before your arrival .
youre crazy , was all she said .
there seems to be a kind of fashion in drugs like everything else .
noi mean that silly little parlourmaid .
you didnt return to the room during that half hour ?
i was not watching her .
im just loving every minute of it .
you must say it , said sir henry .
but that would mean he broke off and looked at his watch .
) so that was all right .
) and enjoying also the revelation of her personality to a listener whose sympathy and attention seemed to be so complete .
i dont quite see the reason for your agitation , i said patiently .
partaking of my currant bun or whatever refreshment i was having , i would reply dutifully , no , grannie , i wont stay in as long next time .
on the contrary , it is highly plausible .
they would be especially careful of their captive , since he represented a potential gold mine .
kettering was still alive at that hour .
i dont understand you , replied tuppence with dignity , adding rather inconsequently : and , anyway , youre wrong !
the guests depart .
that is to say interesting to see who became the owner of gipsys acre .
ive got to keep my strength up doctor barton said solet me see , where was i ?
' yes , it is quite possible .
and , of course , with a postmortem and all that , so much would be bound to come out , wouldnt it ?
and then , just a year ago , the village had been startled by the news of sir geralds marriage to a miss harpera girl nobody had ever heard of !
and weve been married ten years .
shes very fond of a game .
wells bowed his head .
yes , that is true enough .
poirot , after his long sojourn in england , comprehended that this was an indication of social recognition .
naughty , naughty !
have we got any particulars ofwhat did you say ?
given that the original assumption is correct , it is logical .
at breakfast , he announced his intention of calling upon mr .
she had money , the old lady ?
v it was a few days after that that miss marple , rather pink and flustered , called at the police station in much benham and asked for inspector slack .
i bet youve heard the rumours that are flying round , misser marple , said miss marple .
lily had been in service at st .
then he added : youre feeling all right , arent you .
gambling is life and death to the gambler , but it has no great spectacular value , said mr .
it was rye in his pocket , wasnt it ?
finally he heard steps inside and the door was opened by a tall , thin woman with straggling dark hair who had on an overall and seemed a little short of breath .
but a minute later he abandoned that impression .
with a faint cry (heard by miss johnson) mrs .
rafiel solved it ?
melchett was speaking to slack .
her faintly ironic smile flashed out at him .
but when i think of individual germans , mothers sitting anxiously waiting for news of their sons , and boys leaving home to fight , and peasants getting in the harvests , and little shopkeepers and some of the nice kindly german people i know , i feel quite different .
it gave me a bit of a surprise .
i saw she was dead .
got an eye for a man all right .
you dont want to get tied up with any more women .
no , knowing carmichael , im pretty sure they didnt .
its the same dreamnight after night .
you and she ?
its exactly as though a spider had got into an inkpot and was walking over a sheet of notepaper !
cruelty and benevolence !
to one of these the man with the white hair made a polite request for information .
you ought to have married a woman like that .
if you disbelieve the defendants story and are satisfied , beyond any reasonable doubt , that the defendant did , upon friday , september _num_ th , discharge his gun at close quarters to vivien barnabys head with intent to kill her , then , gentlemen , your verdict must be guilty .
you are the criminals spouse to be , arent you ?
are you sure they were the same ?
if he wants to ask any questions , im sure none of you will object .
well , there doesnt seem to be anything more that i can do here .
the observation lacked coherency , perhaps , but it left no doubt of ellens meaning .
now , lets have that again to be quite clear .
the spinster listening to her , nodded gently whilst her mind reviewed , tentatively , widows she had known in the village of st .
christows practice and i can tell him everything he wants to know .
all the same , said the woman , i am disturbed .
im ever so fond of flowers .
she went away by the express the next morning back to london .
the others were supposed to be dancing to the wireless in the big ballroom .
i left the kitchen to find griselda and dennis waiting for me in the hall .
unhappiness can be classified under five main headsno more i assure you .
what isnt true ?
the man passed the recess , breathing heavily as he went .
soit !
charlottes in the kitchen waiting to give you a hand .
go ontell me more .
did you mention this loss ?
some of it was true , of coursebut how much ?
certainly not suicide , said miss marple decisively .
presently she produced the oilskin packet , and asked me if i recognized it , watching me like a lynx all the time .
that puts the time of death at after nine-twenty on the evening of the third .
miss margrave had gone to bed , and lady astwell was with sir reuben in the tower room .
its no good , said pat .
she smileda superb , confident camera smile .
he led the way on to the small glazed-in verandah where there were chairs and a table or two .
well , landing me up in the proper mess he did .
anyway , she avoided me as much as she could .
i , too , like him very much .
the best thing for a child , i am convinced , is to have what i should term healthy neglect on the part of both its parents .
you dont hang a man for having tuberculosis .
i made a round of the camp , fussed unnecessarily , took all precautions against an attack by hostile arabs .
i cannot think how .
the village policeman might come along and see it .
she was playing detective .
im rather an obvious sort of personalways have been .
we can hire him one , said bobby .
the second no , poirot thought , had sounded suddenly doubtful .
he braced himself against the deep hostile suspicion of those eyes .
renisenb went slowly across into the house .
he likes biting people who are going out through the front door .
clever , amusing and a thorough good sport .
both those things could have been put to the lips naturally without anyone remarking on iti am right , am i not ?
when i arrived i would be immediately greeted with reproaches .
i dont understand you , i said .
and he knew that she had thirty pounds in the house ?
come now , miss marple , said colonel melchett goodhumouredly , havent you got an explanation ?
the explanation is simple enough .
i knew you found something , said tuppence reproachfully .
the last was the pleasantest .
and only to open it on the chain when it gets near dusk .
i told him that he and miranda were not going to get pippa , and he went away .
she has just got into a nervous state but these things arent hereditary .
have i put my foot in it ?
to put the lid on everything , guy pagett must needs engage in a drunken brawl the last night .
but my belief is that i was deliberately poisoned !
she was struggling with a temptation that had assailed her ever since geralds departure .
wonder if he was in the indian mutiny .
i should say she was quite definitely a pathological case .
it is up to themas you say over here .
we must arrive at the reason behind these quite trivial pilferings .
there was a short silence .
my dear child , he said , it is some months to next march .
all the same he took out his notebook and made an entry in it .
her glance met his placidly , without flinching .
there was a cigarette holder , a handkerchief , a tiny silk rosebud , and a little gold match box .
not until the last evening , said miss marple .
illerill try to do something about it .
i want to ask you something , she said .
one of the few people i obey .
he opened the gate , passed through , and went along a short drive .
i agree to what you ask .
then leave things as they are just for the moment , decided bland .
that is one of the conditions ofsale .
im afraid ive been taking up a lot of your time .
but he went to fight and got a posthumous v .
now , i will try you and see if i get what i want .
but on superintendent spence , who knew men , he had not made that impression .
she had great difficulty in reading now , and trouble seeing things in a bright light .
i was in no hurry for tommy .
of course , it was all very exciting and forbidden and one enjoyed it enormously .
i thought , though , that she looked rather worried .
and in any case you mistake her character .
i remember one day i had had a gallop round the fields with a couple of robins friends .
but seriously , my dear young lady , do count on me if there is any way in which i can possibly assist you .
that was the way that they must all have stared at cora that day when she said , but he was murdered , wasnt he ?
his voice rang out coldly .
for you then , my friend , the routinewith all the machinery you have at your disposal .
two pots ?
everything was nicely in train and then came the shock of halloween and joyces sudden assertion of having witnessed a murder .
but she likes to be thought so .
the other shrugged her shoulders .
her voice held a very lively contempt .
i should say he came to a stop .
but it was rather awkward sometimes when he would lose his temper with the servants .
i saw the whiteness of her cheeks under the rouge , and heard the terror in her voice .
youve tried to make her ridiculousbut you havent succeeded , my child .
it is true that i had a touch of liver at bulawayo and behaved like a bear in consequence , but i had had a disturbed night in the train .
she left her last place of employment , he mentioned a famous school , last summer .
major summerhayes just brought her in .
any calls for help and i return and deal with the matter .
cross my heart .
(if armitage had talked , theyd know about it .
george wasnt thinking of rosemary .
he thought the house belonged to someone else .
i am sure you are ill .
his fingers were busy .
let us go there now .
but frightfully lucky .
alas , said poirot , i have not that felicity .
the words seemed to amuse him .
do thatand for goodness sake , leave me aloneor i shall never get my speech done .
good gracious , i forgot all about fou-ling .
putting relations and friends off with soothing words .
surely you remember who told you mr .
i explained this rather haltingly to the inspector .
he had not seen me , indeed i soon realized by his breathing that he was fast asleep .
oh , just by asking her questions , replied sir james easily .
something that he was determined not to give .
miss knight left the room .
i thought so , and wondered why .
father looks at gwenda and thinks perhaps it was her .
i dont knowi dont know .
as a compromise , it was agreed that she would write another short story for the church , also to be called , for legal reasons , the greenshore folly , though it will probably be published under some other title .
but lavington cant have buried it under the coal ?
she chose an evening when she knew you had quarrelled with lady tressilian .
well , as i was saying , i can size up men pretty accurately .
here , he added , i have a list .
its because it was the day after the hold-up at miss blacklocks .
you have to join in these things to please a lady .
you need someone to help you i had needed hermia .
you say as this stuff was medicine , good medicine ?
hercules porrot speaking personally ?
i expect you heard that he ran away with a dreadful yugoslavian womana most abandoned creature .
im in a bit of a mess , he said .
and im sure it looked wonderfully natural at a distance .
how delightful !
so , the original and rejected novella the greenshore folly was elaborated into the novel dead mans folly and christie wrote the shorter and similarly titled miss marple story greenshaws folly to swell the coffers of the church authorities .
you think hed get after her ?
sure she is .
weve got to eat , you know .
hastings , this is a vast plot , and that vacant-looking young man is our archenemynumber four !
show her the advertisement , said miss blacklock .
she was far harder hit to all appearance than miss bulstrode .
some time in the last three years (not longer , she was sure) she had taken a railway journey , and looking out of the carriage window , had noticed a house .
i saw the devil there so i knew what i had to do .
it was a new , shining patent leather shoe with a large ornate buckle .
youve got your evidence .
can you tell us what this drug was , doctor ?
it is your hospital training .
what there is in it for us , finished lenox , with that sideways smile that her mother always found difficult to understand .
the thief , whoever he or she may be , must know that sooner or later a search will be made , and therefore a hiding place in his or her own cabin would be injudicious in the extreme .
celia ravenscroft was with her .
the old woman said : the child prefers to go by herselfdont you , jinny ?
i will walk a little in the courtyard .
his manner was priggish and his reception of us just short of courteous .
the leaves on the trees were golden in the evening light .
still supporting the old man , i went with him into the room .
) and a ruby cross of antique design round her neck .
you cant coerce him .
if she had told one unnecessary liethen all the other lies were possible .
it means nothingnothing at all .
he thought she was going to fall .
returned unopposed , said mrs .
i had a friend in london .
as he rejoined the other , he said : what on earth makes you call bletchley a mystery man ?
i looked up angrily .
she might have been directing which tennis sets the girls were to play in .
' look here , charles , this is the devil of a business .
but yes , said poirot encouragingly .
i cant remember exactly .
i was a credulous , superstitious ass .
he had rather the feeling of having been summoned to the quarterdeck to give an account of himself .
he raised a solemn hand and blinked his bleary eyes .
katherine looked rather astonished .
i ought to have thought about it more , and been more sympathetic !
she was looking at him with complete astonishment .
i think you know , miss argyle , who killed your mother .
so precipitate was his descent that he collided with tredwell , the stately butler , just as the latter was crossing the hall bearing a fresh supply of hot coffee .
(violet !
but i saw it after that .
i always hate being out of things .
maggieitit cant poirot was still examining the girls body .
that in the five minutes clayton was alone in the sitting room , someone else came in and killed him .
but she was in a sense trapped , and she had at this particular moment , or so poirot judged , a wish to talk about things .
at four-thirty , mrs .
never know what they will do , or wont do .
i should have said youd have had no end of women pestering you about their pet dogs .
suddenly jimmy started violently and caught his companions arm .
but i would like to point out that a great many of the assumptions you have made have been based upon what has been told youpossibly told you very plausibly .
she turned away and said she had to go and give a pep talk to the butcher .
its no good saying things just to cheer me up .
count stylptitch was also staying at chimneys at the time .
that is what made you sure in your mind that it was a cat who had been in the room .
that beggar , isaacstein , sleeps soundly , he remarked , with a touch of envy .
) kent road .
a city gentleman , living at ealing , on crossing haven green to get to the district railway station that morning , had observed a brown-paper parcel stuck between the railings .
a man accustomed to quick decisions and a man whos quite at home doing dangerous things .
she shuddered again at the remembrance .
they came from high and low alike , and bore striking testimony to the place my friend had made for himself in the country of his adoption .
think what your father would say .
would you have any objection to telling us exactly what passed between you ?
take the evening train back .
i looked out as the land came nearer .
this girl you mentioned , you feel she is in need of care and protection ?
so mrs cresswell had reason to believe she was an interested party .
well telephone down in the morning .
the police car will take you .
that little pipsqueak may have seen any woman with a kid .
ive tried toto explain what i feel to mrs .
the young man , short and dark , bowed jerkily .
the sun had just risen and they had stopped for breakfast .
yes , yes , my child , he assured her .
hautet sighed .
now look , grannie , im sure that they havent really gone .
race and kemp looked at each other .
did you go to the ritz hotel gallery to see the show ?
peters thought a sad mess .
i want to get him free to continue to lead his own life as best he can lead it .
was it long before mr .
well , let us pass from that .
george brought in an omelette .
youve been very wise to say nothing of that until now .
it may be that he returned home unsteady on his feet and that , having no fear of the person who accosted him , he bent of his own accord to bathe his face in the lake .
i shall be able to buy lots of jewels from them .
so i wandered into the farmyard and then the door opened and owen came out .
( _num_ ) those prints were made by someone deliberately trying to throw suspicion on ralph paton .
_num_ th , result of enemy action .
and the maid , you take it , is in with her mistress ?
he hit upon poirot as a compromise .
elsie screamed .
i have to scold them sometimes and make them go out without me .
she might have got one or two of the chauffeurs to come and burst in the door - and then the key question would have been overlooked altogether .
i lock it .
rivington had had a vague idea that carstairs presence in england had something to do with the death of savage .
go there , shut the door behind you and give a crynot a screama cry .
a truthful woman ive always been .
poirot , the violence of a river in spate , the disruption of the great natural forces in naturenothing less , in fact , than a miracle .
and the flower borders too , i suppose , said miss marple .
from here there was no land to be seen anywherejust a vast expanse of blue water rippling in the evening sun .
after handing it over the counter she set out briskly for home , stopping at a bakers to buy three-pennyworth of new buns .
i must confess im rather glad to have you here with mei suppose lomax will insist on coming back and talking to me when its all over .
at all costs , he will prevent his son marrying the daughter of this evil woman .
theres no need .
happy in those who were spread round him .
it was all her doing .
it seemed frankly incredible , but there was the evidence of the blowpipe , of the dart found on the floor , of the mark on the deceaseds neck and of the medical evidence to show that , incredible or not , it had happened .
' and then suddenly he realized what his quicker-witted friend had already seen .
you know perfectly .
armstrong went over to the washstand .
i went back to the body .
why not simply steal the jewels ?
no , sir , it is not the mistresssat least she looked suddenly startled .
she tailed off into incoherencies .
fortunately for them chance was on their side .
he added suddenly : wheres helen now ?
he has a great disdain for tangible evidence , things like footprints and cigarette ash , you know what i mean .
of course i was .
it is not permitted that i take the car through these gates .
sitting up in court feeling like god almighty .
nobody seems to have disliked her to the point of hatred .

asked the secretary .
greta and i arranged it , she said .

it cannot be the murderer who rings upthe murderer has laid all his plans to incriminate jane .

it was no use blinding ones eyes to facts .

thats clever of youthats really very clever of you .
and lily really was threatening him ?
i cant see anybody who could possibly have wanted celia to die .
whose was it ?
well , it was just then that bauerstein arrived .
cicely horbury said , hell !
isnt that what i want to follow on here now ?
you have known it all along ?
at least so i heard .
im expecting joe back in a minute , said maureen .
i had noticed that she had been very strange in her manner for some days .
youll hear from me in good time .
pray be seated , mademoiselle .
to giraud , all examining magistrates were fools , and to m .
she wasnt a strange woman , said inspector craddock .
thatthat he wouldnt let it matter between us .
poirot said : listen , miss carlisle .
i do the best i can , but of course i cant pretend to be really modern .
i hope , he said sententiously , that the whole matter will soon be cleared up satisfactorily .
' who went up to bed first ?
it was from anne protheroe .

but why , aunt cassie ?
even now i dont know who paris wasand i think its a silly name for a man anyway .
i want to marry your cousin .
inspector campbell said , youre quite sure that no message came here from the canon ?
then just take it back to bollards .
what did you say the address was ?
that scent of hers .
absolutely madwere all mad !
the doctor was a clean-shaven man of middle height .
he shook hands politely , then turned to the girl .
i suppose a lot of different people have lived there , said tuppence .
im not poor , stupid henet any longer .
i am glad to find that such is not the case .
again nobody knows .
turn off the lights , and let us sit round the table in the darkness .
you can do as you like .
but my dear girl , hes a very important man .
one of the richest menpossibly the richest manin the world today .
can you think of a name that would remind you of cherry jam ?
it must be foul , darling .
poirot , you brought me here to ask me something ?
she is inconspicuously dressed in black .
caspars delivery .
fullerton , harrison and leadbetter .
you think that human nature is the same everywhere ?
sometimes its a blessing in disguise .

so on and so onuntil we reach the perfect fitthe truth .
jimmy was deputed to spy upon the dining room .
in this case the method proved efficacious at once .
and she was a good swimmer too .
a young man should marry to please himselfnot to please a stepfather from whom he has expectations .
youd have to take my reasons on trust .

no , no , calm yourself .
there may be fingerprints too .
in the past .
supposing that they left the taxi there , passed through the house and out by another entrance and went elsewhere ?
if i could see better at that moment , as though by magic , the lights came on again .
what else was there worrying her , nagging at the back of her head .
it has occurred to me , said lomax , that a woman might be very useful here .

i was once , i suppose .
his grin , as always , was very attractive .
miss lawson hurried out of the room .

poirot rose to depart .
yes , thats the problem , isnt it ?

do you think he would have done so if that had indeed been the case ?
practically fancy dress , he thought to himself disapprovingly as he said aloud : sir rupert crofton lee ?
rachel , he thought , had had a right to be triumphant .
and it occurred to me at the time that it was quite probable he had actually picked it up in mrs .
not in jeans .
but if hes dead , i must know .
it was quite two minutes before pamela got her breath .
how could we ?
a girl was standing in the entrance of the french window a small , sallow girl , with very black hair and suspicious eyes .
carelli sat , while poirot seated himself in the armchair , and hastings made himself comfortable on the settee .
but sir james was far too wary to be drawn .
emily plucked off her hat and sent it spinning into a corner of the room .
a down train was standing in the station and the up london train was just coming in .
and the district nurse .
i had contrived the girls escape , and evolved a brilliant scheme for saving her from the consequences of her rash actbut i could not rest easy in my mind .
miss marple would be useful to him .

a young man of personality , giving indeed an impression of ability in what he chose to do .
nevertheless i will tell you this .
then foreign servicethe strong light , you knowthat rather did for them .
i thought perhaps a three-handed row was going on , but actually it was angela that they were discussing .
he was a little man , too .
he watched the thought take root in nurse harrisons mind , saw her frown perplexedly , and then saw her brow clear .
i took a look round .
one of those low-down tramps , i suppose , said evans .
oh , my dear , the relief !
asked violet .
leave me with mr .
mrs boynton gave a slow , wheezy chuckle ; it had an almost gloating sound .
you and i and mrs .
, the residence of mrs .
then , as if to distract my mind , he pushed an open letter across to me .
something seemed to be amusing her immensely .
he admits he came here to see helen again .

of course , said hailey preston , she might have used the stuff herself and taken a dose , and as i say , had an allergy .
i can remember nothing consistent with guilt .

there was some curious undercurrent in her voice that i could not understand .
the vicars voice rose again .

rycroft drily .
good heavens , theyve sold you happy families .
what reason ?
dissimulate !
poirot puts the fact rather brutally , but what he says is undeniable .
the mischief was done when we came .
poirot cried out : we have been idiotsfools !
rosamund said with some exasperation : i suppose this is the sherlock holmes touch !
in a few minutes we were ushered up into the ladys suite .
she sounded quite mad .
there was a doctor .
japp came forward and introduced hercule poirot .

no wonder he was frightened when sonia let him know she had overheard one of his private conversations about the big four .

the inspectors tone was confident .

im living with the melfords in kent until i make up my mind if theres anything id like to do .
inspector campbell was tempted to go into this question of a wardrobe in the wrong place .
they abandoned the discreet reticence of private inquiry agents , and revealed to him the whole history of the joint venture , whereat the young man declared himself tickled to death .
i dont understand ?
youd have done better , battle .
precisely , said the inspector drily .
' poirot struck an attitude .
among these gifts was an enormous jar of meat extract from new zealand .
i daresay hes dashed off there now , thought tuppence .
to the master , madame .
hed wondered what they were cooking up together .
it left me prematurely aged and embittered .
rafiels way , she thought .
daphne rose with a happy laugh .
the man was deadshot through the head .
in fact , to put it bluntly , the fellows a damned nuisance .
marshall , patrick redfern really cares for his wife .

the major dug him cheerfully in the ribs .
do you mean his mother ?
there is a struggle .

a remarkable document .
he was in an awful state .
as to the shot now he listened to the butlers account .
thirty-two evans frankie gasped .
i remember once wondering whether she was a cripple .
passionately so .
still , in that unlikely event , there is always the possibility of bribery .
only for the most fantastic motive .
i suppose her mind must be totally unhinged , i said slowly .
i was angry !
wasnt going to say anything without her solicitor .
it was the mistresss hand all right , and i saw as shed written it and slipped it in there waiting to post it the next day and then shed forgot , which is the kind of thing she did many a time , poor dear .
nobody really wants herexcept those people who cant keep their servants , and they treat her like a galley slave .
she got up and came towards him .
miss waynflete agreed eagerly .
there , leading me through a kind of secret door , he showed me with great pride an enormous quantity of onions on the floor , covered with straw , and also a mass of apples .
she walked slowly towards the desk .
he asked fatuously .
nobody , sir .
renisenb said sharply : no , no , i want everything the same !
its impossible to tell about a thing like that straight away .
poirot shifted his glance to theresa arundell .

we do have a pull , murmured suzanne complacently .
she didnt , inspector , im sure she didnt .
you had no special reason for discharging him ?
rapidly my sister ran over a list of maidens living in the neighbourhood , with profuse reasons for and against .
still all of a tremble i was .
i dont know what to think , said father lavigny frankly .

yes , that was the place , where the wall was broken away .

was that likely ?
miss marple wants us to go over tonight after dinner .
a ribbonlike stream of mist was issuing from the mediums mouth .
i am not usually clumsy .
ive been very fortunate in my life , sir .
when did your husband first inform you of his visit to scotland ?
do you mean that they all suspect each other , or that they know , actually , who did do it ?
edward had had a hunch there was something wrong about the olive branch .
i really couldnt say .
i think you are mistaken , hastings .
he poured out the whole story to me .
i dont want to play .
i expect youve heard about it .
' ' mademoiselle , ' said poirot , and his voice was abrupt .
poirot waited a minute , then he went on : at the time , perhaps , he , too , was astonished .

claudia glanced at her wristwatch .
i had better represent you to be connected with journalism in some way .
so peaceful in these parts , so free from crime .

she drove the car round to the garage and went in search of her father .
she had quantities of diamonds in old-fashioned settings , and she wore them as her mother before her had worn them : pinned all over her indiscriminately .
poirot was sitting by the window .
i dont think , you know , that there is likely to be anything particular that you want there , but ive got the names and addresses of certain births , marriages and deaths .
four , said rhoda .
they like a good address false teethi cant think why false teeth are so popular .
by someone in poirots immediate proximity .
my maid was there .
nevile turned the wireless on to a programme with music .
i felt i had seen him before .
youd describe him probably as a scream , said inspector bland .
there is nothing so far that seems psychologically incorrect .
i daresay it doesnt mean anythingbut now that i know that mrs .

and you abandoned it ?
theyll be longer , i expect , doing the car than they say .

hercule poirot had unhooked a portrait from the wall and was studying it by the light from the terrace .
there was another victim , madame .
youve got to choose something to do , i said to rosalind dictatorially .
there is a safe on the wall of my husbands dressing room in which he always keeps a fairly large amount of ready money .
i dont believe he will like being the villain , i said to archie dubiously .
you will help me , wont you , m .
but there arent any witches nowadays ?
there was nothing very surprising in his escape when one came to think of it .
the old woman stared at tuppence with a kind of devouring interest .
whynow you mention iti believe i did hear a kind of a bang .
renisenb said slowly : i have been wondering about nofret .
its really rather exciting .
you too have heard .
amongst them , i shall find the person who killed mr .
i dont mean i thought he was going to be killed or that there would be a revolution .

mary was situated about two miles from the little station , and styles court lay a mile the other side of it .
battle was reflective for a minute or two .
perfectly , perfectly , said the count easily .
oh , that , said bill .
yes , ive got a banking account , and father pays so much into it every quarter but im not surei think perhaps , by now , they might be looking for me .
both men were on the point of passing out of the room .
you are affianced , is it not so ?
finally the right bus came and there was a surge forward .
he sank down in a chair by the fireplace , his head in his hands .
i remember perfectly now .
jane had gone straight to the picture of marguerite .
but i imagine thats only temporary .
chandra lal who had heard of the sabotage to elizabeths papers became excited and voluble .
i hope youve got a very good time coming to you .
she had put through telephone calls to lawyers , had rung crosshedges and two firms of estate agents to try and get in touch with mary restarick .
heres to our joint venture , and may it prosper !
it has to be the right hospital , miss somers insisted , or else they wont come .
from the result of observation and reflection , said poirot .
she might have got one or two of the chauffeurs to come and burst in the doorand then the key question would have been overlooked altogether .
he came to the conclusion that giuseppe had mistaken the packets of letters , enclosed as they were in the other wrappings , for the memoirs themselves .
and thats what that house has got .
what time do you have your meal ?
and when his accident came , it was just the faade that was torn away , and you all saw him as he really was .
it was sheer bad luck that made sir claud open the safe again last night .
i played atrociously , but fortunately the cards played themselves .
she told me she had been down again for a book , too .
she said it in rather a childish way , if you know what i mean .
though she ought to have realised it clearly enough .
she has reason to fear a certain person .
the boys shook their heads .
about you , madame ?
really , the whole thing was very stupidnot spirituel at all !
no violent political affinities so far as weve been able to discover .
craddock said sharply , when did you get this ?
go on , nurse .
' poirot rose from his seat , and patted the young man kindly on the shoulder .
you butted in and took over from the local people .
so i came to this conclusion : simeon lee had not only his legitimate family in the house , but an unacknowledged and unrecognized son of his own blood .
have some beer ?
for the past three weeks .
i said so to mrs .
with an effort he thrust bridget into the back of his mind .
bread crumbs and mashed potatoes and just a teeny weeny bit of cheese to justify its name .
i dont write about them much because im so afraid of getting the terms wrong .
well have to leave it at that , poirot .
it was in mr .
in his car there was a spaniel waiting for him .
she had only got as far as telling him that she was looking at herself in the glass .
have you ?
youve no idea , aunt jane , of all that it has meant .
he was going to adopt her .
first class _num_ to _num_ .
that is , if the herr doktor will admit us .
i suppose youve told him about the countess ?
she stood frowning down at the floor .
medical men who are interested in these subjects visit there .
leidner two years ago .
i did not even undress .
the car sped across the bridge .
i mean you didnt go to put the wind up him or anything of that sort ?
he managed to avoid meeting his mothers eye .
a woman who is dead , imhotep answered shortly .
you see , i was brought up by relations in new zealand and of course they could never tell me anything aboutabout my father , and my stepmother .
' hercule poirot , beaming placidly across the table at his friend , waved an expository hand .
it was in late spring , _num_ , that hercule poirot received a visit .
and were met by the news of mr .
she drove back to chelsea , put away the car in the garage and walked slowly to the studio .
sometimes its a very heady thought .

he looked over the house professionally , and said : well , ill give you my advice .
im sure ive aroused your curiosity , he said , but as a matter of fact were in a spot of trouble at sunny ridge .
shed remembered him all right .
a nice lady , but she could do with a tonic , id say .
ohno .
colonel melchett said slowly , we canerverify your theoryup to a point .
simon restarick hadnt any children , and his brother andrew restarick only has this daughter .
it says nothingbut nothing at all !
merrilees seemed a little embarrassed .
he looked what he wasa gentleman first and an actor second .
what you dont seem to realize is that its no joke being mixed up in a murder case .
it was then i decided that in future no one was going to adapt my books except myself : i would choose what books should be adapted , and only those books that were suitable for adapting .
poirot came up in time to hear the answer .
theres nothing to be in a hurry about .
' ' yes , yes .
but he shut it very slowly .
clear my little hand desk , will you , and give me my pen and the notepaper .
tuppence pulled out a rather tattered book from one end of the cupboardto be interrupted by a squeal from betty .
and all that teaching , bottled up among a lot of women .
derek nodded , and turned his steps in that direction .
spence did not give the lighter into rowleys outstretched hand .
it was the future of a child that was at stake .
well , you know what youre like , staff .
but he said , cut it out , man .
cornelias mouth fell open .
and at that moment the garden door opened and claude langton stepped quickly out into the road .
i heard this morning .
it reminds one so much of so many things .
but the tenthwell , i have come across phenomena that are absolutely unexplainable from the ordinary materialistic standpoint .
i can tell you , sir , we dont think much of that inspector .
it mightnt be true at all .
allegra , youre hateful !
you must be making a mistake .
and honestly , i didnt care about either of them !
they were just settling themselves at a table in the lounge when poirot marched up to them in his most military fashion , and addressed nick directly .
it was patently an excuse , trumped up in a hurry , by a woman who felt it urgent to explain her presencewhich , by the way , you would probably never have thought of questioning .
either mrs rhodes was killed by her husband , or by the chambermaid , or she committed suicide , or she was killed by an outsider whom nobody saw enter or leave .
im being mccarty .
so i came to the point where i asked myself this : did jacko know that a crime was to be committed that night ?
freddie anstice had blown his brains out just before an inquiry by the stewards into the running of one of his horses .
she , too , was arrested .
some of the boulders got loose and came rushing down the mountainside .
lived here !
he said suddenly and surprisingly : it depends on henet , does it not ?
yes , he said something like that .
you know him , perhaps ?

she was beginning to understand sir jamess methods .
had they not persistently followed the wrong car , they might by now have found the boy .
inspector neele gave an avuncular beam which added at least fifteen years to his age .
but they did , mrs .
i rather doubt the practical applicability of what you say , m .

you mean clotilde ?
you cant describe whoever it was , i suppose ?
egg stared at him piercingly .
below the name were the words esthonia glassware co .
always on the track of something utterly impracticable that can be of no earthly interest to anyone other than themselves .
through the window , that is how mrs .
but , my dear , i protested , i have really nothing to saythat is , of the kind you mean .
' that little bottle you found ?
youll see , charlotte will recognize what it is .
' au contraire , it advances us enormously , but enonnouslyt if you must wear a tie pin , hastings , at least let it be in the eyact centre of your tie .
she seemed surprised to see bryan and he seemed to share her surprise .
i meanits bound to be rather tiring , isnt it ?
rosemarys friend .
is there a draught ?
on this trainagain we have a delay .
it is very conscientious of your wife , i am sure .
she was companion or nurse attendant to mrs .
japp asked .
yet you were sent here .
the whole sequence , what shes going back to say , whether itll run her into danger or somebody else into danger .
the first and most important is a remark made to me by m .
did you go in to the meeting at kilchester last night ?
i suppose shes a fairly common type in a small village .
but they didnt die of it , said dr lloyd .
am i really to believe , inspector crome , that my poor brother is the victim of a homicidal maniac , that this is the third murder that has occurred and that in each case an a b c railway guide has been deposited beside the body ?
there was a cold wind blowing , and the station-master approached me and asked if i would like to wait in his office .
she fitted in another piece and then resumed .
poirots advice about it .
poor thing , she looked rather out of it , i thought .
miss marple accepted the dictum .
but it would seem , would it not , that miss zielinsky was embarking on blackmail .
it was dotted with little tables , a space of dancing floor in the middle .
and then i remembered that looking in my address book last night i had seen that this was quite near where you had your apartment .
im quite good at keeping a poker face .
terribly happy .
supposing i didwhat should it be about ?
and ive always been interested in sick folks and clinics , and i shall have just a wonderful life with him .
thats where youre wrong , said kay .
thats what we used to call them , lady matilda explained .
but when the poor boy was really in such a terrible situation , what else could he do ?
that description of boris glydr !
he could have taken what he wanted by means of threats , or he could easily have gagged her .
where were you yourself ?
' aha , you did not notice ?
always out to shock people .
one of the principal controllers , if i may so put it , of money , is a very powerful and talented woman .
it was all most interesting , declared miss pierce .
katherine looked at him apprehensively .
the afternoon passed peacefully .
and ruth , my cousin .
fathers gone a long way away again , said hester .
have you any idea how old this goddaughter of yours would have been at the time ?
best thing is to run him into much benhamto the hospital there .
i mean unless things did happen , people couldnt think of them .
he turned to the chief constable .
so much walking and standing about .
every minute of his time was accounted for until the body was found .
i do so prefer the cheerful inefficient .
i drive up to the front door , ring the bell and wipe my feet on the mat .
it was not till the following evening that tony capitulated , and then he saved his pride by eating his dinner when nobody was in the room .
he was informed that mr .
i still had , of course , my grandfathers nest-egg , so we could count on _num_ a year , but archie hated the idea of touching any of the capital .
no , indeed , said elspeth , a stern woman who looked as though her mouth should always be filled with pins .
one of these war tragedies , i imagine .
he didnt seem offended though , just laughed quite pleasantly and asked me if there were any news of the man with the squint .
bigamy carries certain penalties , lady sedgwick .
the conductor emerged from the compartment , having swung the suitcases up on to the racks .
rather frightening , dont you think ?
i dont think ellie had any idea either ?
frances sudden smile flashed out .
harry , he said , was worth no more than the rest .
he believes that shell divorce her husband and marry him .
i cant think why you dont arrest dr .
believe me , dear miss grey , yours cordially .
now ill tell you something more .
poirot said : it might be both .
now then , boy .
and finally the attack on herself .
lombard said : i agree .
nobody , least of all his dead aunt , had known in what perilous straits charles stood .
but there were other deathsthe death of giuseppe , a blackmailer , it is true , but a human being .
and more !
i brought it because i expected to run into a spot of trouble .
lets forget it .
the child is burdened with guilt if he does not fulfil their hopes .
excuse that i derange you , but i shall be obliged if you will unlock for me the door of mr .
we must hold back the railways .
go back to his hotel , said mrs .
surely , if he had been coming , he would have been here by now .
unless someone bolted the door behind him , said mr .
certainly it is odd , agreed poirot thoughtfully .
why not let this kind gentleman here cut my throat without delay ?
let us hear them .
she said , pity ?
my wife arrives next weekor the week afternow what have i done with her letter ?
ive always felt very strongly , said jean , that nigel has no moral sense .
youve deprived me of my rights .
i remembered what the inspector had told me , and i was mildly surprised .
lenox reassured her and came back into katherines room .
do you feel like a bloodsucker , jerry ?
quest-ce qu il y a ?
im sorry if i offended you , i said .
oh , god , dont let him !
he shifted to elainei tried harriet .
this is very weak and silly of me , she said .
she had lived in calcutta and taught elocution and worked amongst the native population .
youre to give away the prizes .
it really didnt matter very much .
there was mrs .
you are all in accord ?
well , sir , why not use your little grey cells , and see what you can do .
the husband was killed by the lover in an upstairs room , and the guilty pair fled , but as they fled , they looked back at the house , and saw the face of the dead husband at the window , watching them .
they were meagre in the extreme .
miss cram ?
he said : youre right .
there is only one other possibilitymurderand you cant have murder without a murderer .
he changed the subject by observing : lady stubbs is much younger than her husband .
but pamela ' s attention had been diverted elsewhere .
they were more fun and quicker to write , and my work reflected the light-heartedness that i felt at this particular period , when everything was going so well .
they hardly qualified for the moment as people who took themselves seriously .
it followed me .
gardener , not loquacious for once , sighed and said : i really do thank you , m .
well , this proves that it wasnt a mistake .
ive got both .
she liked all small children , but she kept her dignity and was a strict disciplinarian in her own way .
everything makes sense .
but do i want that ?
the whisper , so faint as hardly to be heard , was urgent and insistent .
i did think for a moment or two she was going to faint .
what took you to swallows nest , id like to know ?
he sat down opposite philip eastney with the sense of accomplishing the inevitable .
bantrys eyes following her as she walked up the drive .

rosemary sheila .
but clearly weve got to find a first .
a man was coming up .
theres florrie west with adenoids , and miss grundle , who is at least fifty and as plain as a haystacknothing much there to excite a man .
asking more of life , perhaps , and receiving less .
some people have had double windows put in .
i believe in democracyandwhats that but brotherhood between men and sisterhood between women ?
in a dark corner of the latrine a pearl embedded in a little piece of chewing gum in the house of one abdul mohammed .
pritchard usually becoming dissatisfied with them after a few weeks .
it all tied up with that .
i said firmly : yes , it is .
she was a tall , serene-looking young woman of twenty-seven who , although her face was unlined , yet looked older than her years , probably from a sedate maturity that seemed part of her makeup .
yes , he said , in a low voice .
the superintendent paused and a twinkle came into his eye .
of course , its very unfortunate that joyce should have made this silly remark about seeing a murder .
sutherland , was it ?
there was a faint nervousness in his manner .
of course i realized at once the terrible position i was in .
alfred , or both of them , to come up after dinner .
it was a slack momenthalf past six .
barnes went on : i see youve got your man ?
kameni planted himself directly in renisenbs way .
and then she said something and he answered , all right .
what then was the reason for this ?
the place of no return , he said softly .
its the way the sun comes in from the window sideways and lights it up .
id like you to get this right , she said .
that theres no knowing what i may do ?
although unable to see how poirot had deduced mr .
i can say the same , said mr .
ellis , of course , jane wilkinsons maid .
good morning , mum , said mrs .
the people in that plane wanted to live .
where we had breakfast together : hard-boiled eggs , tea and native bread .
it seems an absurd question , but have you any enemies , mrs .
not that there was anything to show in her face , you knowjust her hands turning and twisting .
but this time it didnt come off !
on that day i gave my guests , i remember , a special disquisition on the spotted hemlock .
in the bed , lying flat under a shaded light with her head bandaged , olive betterton lay unconscious .
millions of times .
owens new secretary .
a little chap ?
come along and have a drink before dinner .
suppose she doesnt come ?
i suppose you can have something wrong with your heart and nobody knowing about it .
chapter nine inspector sharpe sighed , leaned back in his chair and rubbed his forehead with a handkerchief .
he has always been a great traveller in the wildsit is quite on the cards that he may not return for years to england , though he is getting on in years .
' ' not a doubt of it , ' said sir george .
ran way with someone .
he was not listening to her flow of talk .
i didnt like that .
esther could never have made his own pulses beat one jot faster , but he admitted her magnificence .
she must have laughed up her sleeve !
in the middle of the floor lay harlequin on his back with his arms outstretched , in his motley of black and red .
in the coach from bucharest is an old gentleman with a lame leg .
a monster , if you know what i mean .
the boat assumed an angle that made it practically impossible for me to sit where i was and keep still as ordered , and also frightened me a good deal , but as we scudded through the water my spirits revived and i was transported with happiness .
they handed it over to us , said dermot , and so , naturally , as soon as i got down here i came to headquarters .
your husband is afraid for you .
there is nothing in that ; trefusis is as mild as milk drinks milk , too , i believe .
yes , miss st .
a man who is upset about something might conceivably come down to dinner dressed in his pyjamasbut they will be his own pyjamasnot somebody elses .

one thing mrs lacey had done : prevailed upon peverell to place the pudding in front of her so that she could help it rather than hand it in turn round the table .
weve only his word for it that he heard footsteps and saw a man going downstairs and out at the front door .
oh yesin that sense .
i think youre deepvery deep .
guy pagett shook his head gloomily .
i want you to tell me all about the dressmaking business .
dane calthrop .

her husband , who had supplied her with the aforementioned children and a title , but who was otherwise a complete nonentity , had seized at the chance to escape .
must be nice to feel like that , commented the other .
six the mystery of the blue jar the mystery of the blue jar was first published in grand magazine , july _num_ .
you go so far away sometimes .
both max and i thought it would be much better this way , only he didnt want to leave you high and dry at the beginning of the season , where there would be very little time to find anybody else to replace him .
she turned on me like an avenging fury .
i dont like the feeling that someonesomeone in this housesomeone i see and speak to every day is a cold-blooded , calculating poisoner .
they can get at secrets .
she was , as tommy had indicated , a very charming girl .
symmington was not , somehow , the sort of person you associated with tragedies .
lennox said irritably : what is the purpose of all this ?
times literary supplement : the whole case is a triumph of poirots special qualities .
a crime of quiet domestic lifevery unimpassionedvery intime .
so far she had not spokenindeed she had been given no chance , but very soon now speech would be forced from her .
poirot said slowly : it seems to me that there is one very important cluethe discovery of the motive .

you dont know , you see , whats behind them .
well , henry , why on earth i lost the rest , but the acerbity of the tone was evident .
monsieur , i have nothing to go uponnothing but my womans instinct , but i am convincedconvinced , i tell youthat m .
who am i like ?
and you felt , of course , that you had roots here since your family had been here for a long time .
and kennedys right , too .
he took nofret aside and said doubtfully : nofret , are you content to remain here ?
come and let me out , mrs oxley .
you see the door doesnt always latch properly .
i considered that for a moment , but it did not deter me .
that closed the subject for the time being .
really , its elizabeth .
and she was afraid of what clotilde might do .
theyll be waiting .
did the dog drown ?
nobody near her .
then twelve oclock , mr .
nobody ever noticed what i was doing .
he said sharply .
i know , she exclaimed .
i have noticed that when we work on a case together , you are always urging me on to physical action , hastings .
she did not speak , only bowed her head in assent .
you saw it ?
i may be interested in the ladyyesbut i am much more interested in her hat .
and quite rude sometimes !
that depends , sir , as to where you want to go .
emma nodded .
rather a curious business hm .
i told her not to take them to the riviera with her , as i could not afford to have her robbed and murdered for the sake of the jewels .
' yes , it is possible .
ive never seen that photograph in my lifeexcept at mrs .
crossed in love they were , a while back .
the murderer , he planned wellbut hercule poirot he was one move ahead .
it did , in very truth , seem as though jack was rushing on his fate .
just before eleven .
the sentries outside presented arms with a clash .
eh , its come down from the jackdaws nest .
dash it all , ive been pretty well unconscious all the time .
id be happier with twopence a year and a big silent brute of a husband and a brood of brats running after me .
please god , we may be in time .
apart from these sidelights on personality the room did not interest him .
but you said just now .
videmment !
ive no useful knowledge of any kind .
childish stuff .
ellsworthy said much the same .
theres too much rushing about nowadays .
deering hill ?
no , not quite .
and everything else left unconditionally to his beloved wife , eloise .
she stared down stupidly at the feather shaft of an arrow .
i know that quite well .
badgers one of the bestone of the very best .
she sat in her corner looking at me in a kind of awed respect .
hopkinson can tell you .
that is the last moment at which he is known to have been alive .
i cant imagine why you ever married him , he replied , plucking up his courage .
yes , i was lonely .
but you wouldnt stand for murder , or for undue violence .
i think babylon stopped functioning somewhere about five or six hundred bc .
they cannot be seen , but they can be sensed .
you have the natural repugnance , yes ?
we came out of the dense outer blackness into the long lighted room .
old miss marple was very much distressed by it .
she asked me , too , if id ever come across a woman who ran a pub called the pale horse somewhere .
at the farther end of the room , the torch was playing upon the holbein picture .
i believe she married an englishman some years ago and went to england , but at the moment i cannot recollect the name .
he radiated an absurd complacency .
not that arlena was unkind to her .
ive heard sir oswald say so many times that theres nothing for getting a young man on in the world like punctual habits .
one must have soul , dont you think so , captain hawkins ?
he admits receiving a letter from arden then .
her ideas , from the brief experience he had had of her , were original ideas .
you and sobek should take a strong line about it .
great big elephant tusks .
but what it is i am not at present at liberty to say .
you take some of the blood of the infected rabbit ?
what ought i to have done ?
dont you think you could have been ?
on the other hand , if we just catch him in the repentant mood , thats very different .
yet , even allowing for that , i can imagine circumstances arising he broke off .
id forgotten her until you spoke about her .
and thats why when she was off to that funeral and got held up on the way back , and he told me id got to come in and stay the night again , i refused .
youre a lairdo you hear ?
art ?
andrew restarick was a man of middle age , beginning to put on flesh , yet strangely little changed from the man some fifteen years younger in the picture hanging above him .
hes dead , he said quietly .
he may have the delusion that m .
i rang off before he could badger me further .
miss lucy , shes mr .
judiths voice sounded faintly scornful .
but it has to be done .
its to be plan b .
reilly said : when youre dying , maitland , you havent always got a sense of proportion .
we were considering a french impressionist picture , a czanne , i think it was .
jacko didnt kill her .
i wont touch that stuff .
they told me that she would believewould believe she does not , said poirot firmly .
oh , lord , said bill .
he walked on again .
philip was two years younger .
about to say uncompromisingly really ?
lets go over it carefully .
i really came to ask you some questions about the method employed .
not that i think she will .
a boy .
yes , he went on .
they lose control , you know , without being able to help it .
truelove was a small painted horse and cart with pedals .
i myself was in berlin on the _num_ th of last month .
did roger bassington-ffrench specialize in accidents , she wondered .
but since i know who you are and something about you , there is no reason we should not discuss together in a friendly fashion the troubles that afflict you .
only a narrow channel of water divided it from the shore on that side .
he had crumpled up the papers and dashed to conceal them .
no rowdinessif you know what ay mean .
yes , i said , what of it ?
but you have your husband .
you are the murdererwaiti will tell you everything .
she may think it rather odd .
vanderlyn laughed with more assurance .
in england one becomes used to trees having dark trunks and light leafy branches ; the reverse in australia was quite astonishing .
say , havent you tumbled to it yet ?
that back was horribly expressive .
whacking great mushrooms bursting through the walls !
nothing more that you think could help us in any way ?
so thats why claudia didnt turn up that day .
she said ruby was probably up in her bedroom , said the girl had talked about having a headache earlieri dont think that was true , by the way ; josie just said it by way of excuse .
wait a sec , i ' ll ring through and get the latest .
i know , dear , i know .
i mean those that have had it born and bred in them for generations that nobody elses opinion counts but their own .
mayherne was a small man precise in manner , neatly , not to say foppishly dressed , with a pair of very shrewd and piercing grey eyes .
in a voice of weary frustration he muttered , its absolutely infuriating .
must be quite interesting , what youre doing .
poirot said : i see .
he added severely : it was a disgraceful business .
gipsies may have been warned off this property , probably more than once .
here am i , a child eating clairs on my birthday .
then he would be killed , or drugged , and his dead body taken out to sea .
think hes been the contact to tip her off ?
but the man here hadnt even heard of it till i told him about it !
faults should be mentioned as well as good qualities .
od uu _num_ ; ) !
ellsworthyhe keeps the new antique shop but he is actually a gentlemanhe dabbles a little in water-colours and he had done one or two sketches of the girls headand i think , you know , that rather gave her ideas .
lorrimer took a moment or two to consider , then he said : whats the position exactlyas it appears to you ?
ah , monsieur , i have lived !
he wondered what , exactly , she had meant to say .
it was certainly a very curious and interesting case .
see for yourself if you dont believe me .
ah , said the inspector .
it was opened and found to contain the body of the unfortunate davis .
brrrrrh !
julius drew up a chair to the opposite side of the table , summoned a hovering waiter , and dictated his wishes .
one takes things for granted too much , said emily brent .
theyll try to bring that there was anassociation between mrs .
like santonix meant something to me .
yes , thats the only telephone except the one upstairs in my father-in-laws room .
nobody volunteered to tell her , though miss minton , who had been gazing with unabashed interest into her hand , might have been in a position to advise .
he sat down on the edge of the bed and stared moodily at the floor .
first that netand then her bad foot .
but not one that you would accept unreservedly ?
entailed , thats what they call it .
joan , that is a thing that should not be repeated .
me , i have always found it a delightful and pleasing idea to combine business and pleasure together .
im so muddled i cant think at all .
when mademoiselle spoke i had the feeling that what she said linked up with something .
it fell at renisenbs feet .
no , i never saw him before this journey .
thats a date , then , said boyd carrington .
laura welman said : so i shall be up and walking round the house in a few weeks time ?
what stuff ?
he was watching her , saw her look a little disconcerted .
parker pyne went on .
luttrell occasionally affected a faint brogue , she had no irish blood .
you will not listen .
franklins hand when she came out of the laboratory ?
the hotel opened in june , but there was seldom any one there until july and august .
i remember how sylvia flushed and shrank .
when next he came to himself he found himself lying on a motor vehicle of some kind , which was proceeding , with many bumps and bangs , as far as he could guess , up the lane which led from the coast to the village .
i was the only stranger present .
he didnt know what it was i asked him to hold for a moment while i got some money out !
killed lady tressilian and swam back again ?
servants for instance .
reiter got quite red and stammered : she was a charming personmost charming .
joan had been out here for two months with her daughter jennifer who after a bad bout of pneumonia had been ordered sunshine and a dry climate .
seddon about it at once .
she made a graphic gesture .
they positively delight in funerals !
she touched the divan at her side .
she said , everythings gonefinished .
no , not important .
i dont want anyone but rosalind , he said .
that , i will say , was our theory .
war or no war he felt he was deserting tuppence .
his cries proved effective .
we understand each other so well that he knew exactly what was in my mind when i put that question .
had to be certified .
worried thats what he is .
nobody could suspect that it was she who had whispered those menacing words .
she had returned to the house just before six oclock .
was there any container found ?
' ' do you know ffmrs allen was in any mancial difficulties ?
on either side of the so-called road stretched an unbroken line of trees and scrub , rising and falling in gently undulating lines as far as the eye could reach , the colouring a soft , deep yellow-green , the whole effect languorous and strangely quiet .
there was no doubt that he was an extremely handsome man .

sir henry said : im glad to have a chat with you .
their course was a zigzag one designed to bring them as quickly as possible to oxford street .
i got off this time with five pounds to a zenana mission or something .
i had adopted a different way of life and i thought it would be merely unsettling for the child to have a father who came and went , and perhaps disturbed her own peace of mind .
lovehappinesssuccesslove the wall was growing up all round him nowthe curtain soft as silk , the curtain wrapping him round , stifling him a little , but so soft , so sweet !
she ran to him and he put his arms around her .
we want to hear all about it , said bill .
in the estate business he is .
blore cried : we must look for him .
you know , theres a great deal ofwell , queerness aboutmore than people imagine .
he was wonderful at getting round womeni dont know why , really .
there was no one in the house to take charge .
ive thought of a most wonderful idea for a murder in a drapers shop .
i know that , said poirot gently .
he was no longer a ridiculous little man with an absurd moustache and dyed hair , he was a hunter very close to his quarry .
he stuck to it too , that the window to the garden was bolted that evening .
or would you rather not ?
cant enjoy a smoke as i used to .
well , lets hope that success will crown our efforts .
wanted to see the fur fly when i blew in unexpectedly !
not at all , said anthony .
think thats likely ?
he avoided her eyes .
he said impartially .
that was a friend of mine in the navy .
you came in by which door ?
not that anybodys seen .
with our own things .
why , at nine oclock her parents were getting anxious because she hadnt returned .
cust , had so successfully lived up to his role of the invisiblebecause insignificantman , that so far no one had noticed that the same person had been seen in the vicinity of the three murders !
it cant be as bad as all that .
norton , i think , tried to stop me .
how many people do know that , i wonder ?
i presume you use it when you go down to see your father and sister in brackhampton ?
you cant really know till youve seen it .
nothing was proved definitely , but i gather that mollys husband took his sister-in-law home to england and she had once more to go into a mental home .
a disappearing domestic at one enda cold-blooded murder at the other .
he spent some minutes looking for what he wanted .
how long has the house been empty ?
and now he wasif not richat least possessed of a lump sum of money sufficient to realize his dream .
ill say we do .
i want to get him released from confinement .
she saw a place on the creek bank where there were people standing .
no , indeed i havent .
crows nest was a modern bungalow of the better type .
frankly , he had a criminal record .
then he laughed .
the conductor made up my compartment and i also went to bed .
well , well go tomorrow and well see .
but it is usually a very sound guide .
monty asked the doorman for a taxi .
the door was opened .
inglethorp called to cynthia from the hall , and the girl ran out .
its not kindness , said inspector curry .
i hastily sent her a second telegram : just seen news of your grandfathers death .
his appearance is certainly not striking .
your problem interests me , said poirot with a touch of reproof in his manner .
attending early service on the anniversary of her sons death , she put a pound note in the offertory bag .
perhaps its pickles .
well , that happens to many of us .
she said suddenly : mrs .
do you not know very well i am shorthanded ?
the tenants dont need to bring anything of their own , unless they want to .
good morning , said derek kettering curtly .
laura sat at the end of the sofa .
ive always thought , she said , it must be terribly dull to be a man .
the letters knock the theory on the head .
nielson rose from behind a large executives desk .
we had at that moment stepped out into a little clearing in the centre of the trees .
oror afraid of him ?
he has a good reason for asking .
she hurried out .
theyve been known for years .
but that is not so popular as the almighty .
police lined the streetspolice drafted in from outside , the international police .
frankly i think we may say that we all seem to go through a phase of it but one does come out the other side .
he was the third man .
was it possible that , after all , mr .
i said to him that lady yardly had told her husband all , that i was empowered to recover the jewel , and that if it were not immediately handed over proceedings would be taken .
darling jinks !
should one , if one sees a wrong being done , attempt to put it right ?
a lady did come to see monsieur renauld last night , but it was not madame daubreuil .
she lives in the country quietly .
that must have made you somewhat distrait , observed my friend .
his wife , who did know him , had not seen him .
he picked up a rather battered old book .
yes , it was exactly nine thirty .

look here , do you think theres anything wrong about it ?
an airliner crashed only last week and everyone was killed .
ive never seen her fiddling about with yew .
dont think shell ever marry again .
impossible , poirot ?
did you see how she ruined my exit ?
that silly woman , making an appointment with the murderer , and going along so confidentlyto be killed .
all the better perhaps , he remarked , and added apologetically as lord altamount frowned at him , sorry , sir .
all round him there appeared to be pictureson chairs , leaning against tablesall with the appearance of old masters , heavily varnished and yellow with age .
a special licence , i think , is indicated .
women didnt behave like that .
it induces a fit of weeping , painful tears and sinus inflammation .
rivington with a little gurgle of laughter .
i thought i would make you take me in your arms and when you did so , thenthen i would spit in your face and tell you how i hated you !
hair ?
well , well , said mrs .
for a while nothing was heard but the low even breathing of the medium .
and lastly , that inner feeling which most men have about their daughtersthe unreasoning jealousy and dislike for the man who takes her away from him .
tanios smiledit was a charming smilegenial yet wistful .
she raised her eyes suddenly to henriettas face .
dont know whats got into him , said the chauffeur .
goot .
her son took the paper from her .
by tacit consent , all mention of the tragedy was barred .
but what were her guardians about to let her run about london and have these clandestine assignments in battersea park ?
hes got some plan of exorcizing the evil spirits , i believe .
it opened noiselessly and we stepped into the garden .
a very faint exclamation escaped theo .
because peoples faces arent the same both sides .
i think perhaps that i was to blame for agreeing to the secrecy .
the backs of mr .
it is undeniable that lily gamboll used a chopper on her aunt , and the unknown killer of mrs .
it passed out through his fingers and died in waves of soundthat is the truth .
he persisted gently : but your aunt did write to you sometimes , i suppose ?
if gladys doesnt come back in time .
henry put his briefcase on the sofa .
she preceded me into the sitting room .
a sort of isolationist feeling .
non , non , rosalind !
miss nunn still looked blank .
he did not answer immediately , so i went on : how long have i been here ?
why do you call it ygdrasil ?
poirot explained .
she struck me as the kind of woman who if she had known anything about anyone , couldnt have helped talking about it .
her attitude , i thought , was rather antagonistic at lunch leave her to me , said alfred .
there was awe and an almost wondering unbelief in her voice .
even ikramenin !
_num_ sheffield terrace was a happy house ; i felt it the moment i came into it .
at last he said gently : do you know who i am ?
its not a disease one encounters here .
it is important that the pretty young lady , once she has acquired the jewel , should disappear for a while from circulation , so that no pressure can be put upon her , no questions can be asked her .
these central europeans dont like being shown .
anyway , she followed the girl to wilbraham crescent .
and now , said poirot , for my second question or questions .
is that quite fair ?
when hugo said : eh ?
then deirdre looked up and started as she met the intense watchfulness in his eyes .
on him ?
one comes back , i think , to the question of who could have been likely to want to kill marina gregg , to want to so much that having failed once they sent threatening letters and made repeated attempts to do so .
a very strong feeling .
he went across to the telephone as he spoke .
silas hamer caught his breath in involuntary surprise .
it is true she is older than hebut what do men careif a woman is rich !
thirty or forty miles .
no evidence .
i suppose you dont believe a word of what im telling you .
there was nothing flaunting , nothing out of the way about her demeanour , and yet it had somehow the studied effect of a stage entrance .
it is enough , i hope ?
she said simply : its worked !
he read through the dry facts again .
you can put it that way if you like , mademoiselle .
then he asked a question of which virginia did not at once see the drift : your maids not been in this room , of course ?
no , indeed it was not my fault .
and there it was , said miss zielinsky .
lets hear who it was for a change .
i see , he murmured .
ah , well , said poirot thoughtfully .
no , im quite sure she had nothing whatever to do with it .
they gave me this , she said .
as i say , if only mr .
then , as the sounds seemed to betoken that they were about to come out of the room , i beat a hasty retreat .
how wonderful you are !
she was in golfing clothes .
the idea was clearly that gerda was the eagerly awaited guest , and john the mere adjunct .
yes , that is what you said at first .
satterthwaite , smiling .
round the deck we went to the starboard side of the ship .
as a result of hiring this excessively expensive car , about which we had no time to bargain , max and i had practically no money left .
mary mead in solving murders far and wide .
they arent going right or something .
tomorrow i shall be in polgarwith .
although concussion may be termed , i suppose , an act of god , yet from their viewpoint they could be forgiven for that , as i say .
the crime passionel would hardly apply in this case .
besides the doctor would tell him to leave off looking for the house .
every time a word goes home you notice itif you are watching for such a thing .
merroway court .
perry .
he did not seem to see any lack of cordiality in the millionaires manner , and chatted pleasantly about various trifles .
my mouth was parchedhorribly parchedand dry .
one can think one knows a thing , said huish slowly , but if you havent got evidence theres not much you can do about it , is there ?
in the face of all this volubility , tommy felt doubts .
she burst into fulsome praise which , i was pretty sure , was quite far removed from her real feelings .
of course , theres something queer about the house , and whatever it is , its something thats difficult to get at .
he had looked at her so kindly .
she was five years older .
spicer , i dont rightly know what i ought to do .
then he remarked : it was not a very good choice they madeof a spot to bury the body ?
hercule poirot speaks , he said , with a certain grandeur of manner designed to impress whoever was at the other end of the line .
christie discusses the early genesis of the book in her autobiography .
i specially selected no .
i think in your place i should feel much the same .
it reminds me so much of that parlourmaid i was telling you about , she added to dermot .
' ' but probably , madame , she has met with some acciient .
the men got there on the afternoon of the _num_ th at the first moment possible to run a boat ashore there .
to long willowsto see rowleythe oafthe clodhopper !
but kirsten had seen them as individualsas themselveswith all their faults and virtues .
it was apparent at once that mr .
he said : what can one say ?
she said hurriedly and apologetically : ii really didnt feel i could lie down any longer .
inglethorp herself .
not all of them were personally known to him , and he was under the necessity of sorting them out , so to speak .
do you feel its a frightening place ?
wait a sec , ill ring through and get the latest .
too much risk .
the hundredthwell , the hundredth is different .
well , you look to me as though youve got better health than many people of your age .
thats what your chief was saying , said jimmy .
he hasnt been taking it so very long .
yes , said miss galbraith .
others will die before you , said henet , grimly .
i liked lots of hot dishes on the sideboard .
i have only just time to catch my train .
brilliant , erratic , undecided as yet as to the true channel to give it outlet , but undoubtedly genius .
ive left my powder puff in the car .
satterthwaite , in a hesitating voice , that i remember the facts clearly by now .
but there is no proof .
always cabling for money to get out of a scrape .
nobody need be stupid if they try , my dear .
as a matter of fact , he was considered a prize bore on the subject .
hilda said : when your letter came i believed what you saidthat you wanted your family round you for christmas , i persuaded david to come .
in a locked drawer , below two or three innocuous water-colour sketches , he came upon some artistic efforts which caused him to lift his eyebrows and whistle .
i dont think that japp was used to having his arrangements made for him so thoughtfully .
there are certain entries , began fournier .
how wonderful they are .
satterthwaite had said all he had to say .
he did not exempt sir charles cartwright .
clearly then , mrs .
really , geraldine , i dont think its necessary going into all this .
man mad , supplied gwenda .
you have made her , you begin to understand her , you know how she feels , you know where she lives and you know what she does .
dont you think we were alike in character ?
hes a very attractive person , george pritchard .
her alibi is perfectly good .
nicholson shoots bassington-ffrench , leaves the farewell letter , and nips out locking the doorto appear again a few minutes later as though he had just arrived .
my dear man , we dont want anything of that kind .
as he spoke into the receiver he was thankful that aspasia glen could only hear one side of the conversation .
amongst the boys who passed through here , he chose out a small select band .
that is what i did .
behind it , of course , theres fearfear that he may be suspected of having a hand in it .
bit risky , wouldnt it be ?
then if you count the vicar out dont you ?
dermot , who could have done the old boy in ?
itsits gone .
it was not she who fatally attracted menit was men who fatally attracted her .
look for yourself .
and she was , at that time , expecting a child ?
now i have made it my business to find out more about this man .
lets get inside .
now look here , lynnif you were in some real jamblackmail or debtsi might be able to sell land or stockbut it would be a pretty desperate proceeding .
retired indian army .
it will be one of those marriages made in heaven and approved on earth .
the blood had all gone from her face and she looked drained of life .
anthony leaned back in his chair , idly blowing smoke rings .
i think : it has comeit is happening .
do you think im like that ?
you mean ericsson could have been leading some kind of double life ?
is the next question .
she was evidently quite young , not more than nineteen , and as ingenuous as a child .
hes a very bad builder , said hardcastle encouragingly .
amyas said it was the best thing hed ever done .
she must have dropped it after drinking .
as he was walking with it towards the study door , barbara intercepted him .
cruel stupid the police are , said mrs .
oliver exclaimed : good graciousit is mary restarick .
still , the fact was significant .
having paying guests here just enables us to keep going , though i must say weve had a few rude shocks .
but what things and what to do about them ?
city life .
oh , im glad to catch you .
youve hit it exactly , said tony .
it looked almost exactly the same .
that he and his sister were worked up .
there were pictures , sculpture , chinese porcelain , prehistoric pottery , ivories , miniatures and much genuine chippendale and hepplewhite furniture .
his father and mother , apparently , were not a happy couple well , i wont go into all that .
she just regards him as a kind of machine for tipping out fur coats and jewels and expensive clothes .
i blushed a little before the twinkle of his eye .
he seems nice , she said .
we hope youll be very happy with us .
and , in any case , are you prepared to invoke the aid of the law ?
we took every precaution .
but im expecting you .
i think it was entirely theory .
i took it for granted that you understood that .
but i suppose the weather was too bad for her .
laura stared at him in disbelief .
i did not believe much in suzannes argument .
of course not , kirsty .
my dear mother , does that matter now ?
not particularly , i should say .
tommy , said tuppence softly .
angle had really enjoyed teaching .
harfield as companion .
took a car across the townmighty pretty place by the way , i guess ill take jane there for a spell when i find herand then paid it off and struck out along those pinewoods on the top of the cliff .
she was , he thought , about forty-five .
there was my goddaughter , of course .
for some reason harry flushed up to the roots of his hair .
i dont know what i had expected , but i suffered a complete reversal of feeling .
george lee was saying importantly : nothing must be touchedremember thatnothingtill the police arrive .
i felt all exalted as though i had a mission !
well said the inspector , disguising the fact that he didnt .
his heart lifted .
its not summer , remember .
how long would it take him to reach the houseto reach this window , for instance ?
hardmans two grips were soon examined and passed .
thats all ive ever wanted .
what we want to decide is the attitude .
this way .
yet it seemed as though an eternity had passed when i heard the door open and , turning my head , looked up to see melchett entering the room .
i was looking for a body , said lucy .
id like to know a little more he broke off and looked at the body .
but a weekend in the country and a chance to meet the distinguished scientist could be agreeable , as , no doubt , could the suitably expressed thanks of a grateful government and merely for carrying in his pocket from surrey to whitehall an obscure , if deadly , scientific formula .
left her by an aunt .
addressing the three men , he continued , im sorry to intrude , gentlemen , but we have received information that a murder has been committed here .
but they have , protested dermot .
she ate two more sandwiches in an absorbed , rather gobbling fashion in the manner of one who crams food into themselves as though they had an important train to catch .
nicoletis , if you are afraid of something , hadnt you better tell me just what it is ?
the inspector laughed .
but he really is quite unbelievable .
believed to be in financial difficulties .
then it was a lie ?
to sir george , amanda brewis was an efficient machine who took the drudgery of daily life off his shoulders , who answered telephone calls , wrote letters , engaged servants , ordered meals and generally made life smooth for him .
poirot continued : you were there under your own name of richards ; a photograph of you transmitted by telephone has been recognized .
where were you sitting , mrs .
just to assist at a dramatic scene as an interested onlooker ?
gentlemen of that age are sometimes very peculiar indeed where young girls are concerned .
i have never had a cat .
immediately she said to herself , agatha wrote that , i am certain of it .
did mr faulkener know this miss kerr ?
she takes things hard like ruth did .
you heard nothing elsethe opening or shutting of a door , for instance ?
they never suspected anything .
in your own surgery !
his eyes met hers and , as though she saw the anxiety in his , she smiled reassurance .
hush , said tommy .
you have been feeding , like the mares of diomedes , on human flesh .
i tested that a second time the other day when i asked mr .
the train was gathering way .
judith , of course , thinks he should park his wife anywhere and get on with the job .
he was not a springing kind of man .
nevile glanced at the clock .
macdonald ought to be interested in the way my game is coming onthe scotch are a great golfing nation .
what about you , poirot , old boy ?
not noticing particularly as it were .
making an inside job of it , said the chief constable reluctantly .
there is something queer there .
there are things in life that make one truly sad when one can make oneself believe them .
the lepers .
it was the place i first saw her , you know .
she said : he was keeping his voice low .
upstairs , downstairs , in my ladys chamber .
she herself , it seemed , had helped the parkinsons in garden work some weeks earlier and was responsible for foxgloves and spinach being planted in close proximity .
pace was shot .
he tapped himself on the chest .
i dont think thats the sort of way things would be done .
miss rowan and miss blake are miss rowan and miss blake .
she put this to a practical test and exclaimed , why i do believe thats old jane marple .
vulnerable , so to speak .
wed better all go down together .
what did you do with it afterwards ?
he denies it , of course , but then he was scared .
and you want me to invite judith and miranda to my flat or house in london ?
opportunity good .
ought to have a beano tonight .
rogers had a flat monotonous voice .
the introduction in question had been a matter of a few moments while there had been a queue in front of the counter .
and i believe that mrs .
it was justan amusement .
i see that the plan does not commend itself to you ?
how careless these people are .
insisting on having killed everyone the way you did !
leidner nodded her head gently .
somewhere about then .
i dont know why we come to these things .
thats clever of you .
im just about sick and tired of lawyers .
we meant to have it restrung , but mummy forgot .
it happened that he did know that name .
i used to lie in bed at night looking at it in the firelight or the subdued light of nursies oil lamp on the table .
wish she had .
nevertheless , i had my own opinion as to that .
gates of baghdad or is it the gates of damascus ?
as i have said , i resented the removal of caroline a good deal : i liked the part she played in village life : and i liked the idea of village life reflected through the life of the doctor and his masterful sister .
im afraid i have not shone over this matter , he said vexedly .
youd sayyoud say !
but i expect he had his reasons .
sometimes you just go about giving all your possessions away and writing cheques on bank accounts that dont exist , just so as to benefit people .
and also who killed edna brent ?
it was unlikely that she would know mr .
which brings me to the pointthe sunningdale mystery .
please yourself .
he was also taking in all our letters to catch the air mail .
a neatly attired woman of middle age was standing , twisting her hands nervously in their neat cotton gloves .
shes a sweet girl , mr .
sit down , molly .
she wants to .
he was just a weak character .
shes a splendid girla real good sportand mark you , shes got brains too .
aha , he said .
lansquenet used to buy them at sales , miss gilchrist explained .
she spoke with animation .
do you mean to say ?
i shall be able to do what i like then .
most pleasurably surprised .
rather a great gun too .
no , none of them had been happy .
i did say them to you , didnt i ?
everard looked annoyed .
the girls trunks are unpacked on arrival and their things put away in the way i expect them to be kept .
oh , hundreds !
youve followed up more wildcat trails than anyone i know .
i hear that there was a russian countess there of subtle beauty , said socks .
its odd , said the girl with unconsciousness rudeness , but i do .
you were kind last year .
surely , with a disability of that kind he stopped me by waving an agitated forefinger .
francis was much the more intelligent of the two .
not like major burnaby , that you would know as a military gentleman the first time you clapped eyes on him .
bartlett , with whom joe ellis lodges at _num_ mill cottages .
and i have the right to do what i like with my own life .
that is all for the present , m .
i shall be at the office most of the day .
echoed clare politely .
any decent germans fighting for his countrynot slinking over here to get out of it !
poirot was sad and dissatisfied .
a publicist for the film company actually announced that the detective is described by the authoress as an elderly man with an egg-shaped head and bristling moustache , whereas austin trevor is a good-looking young man and clean-shaven into the bargain !
the figure raised its head .
his room had a second door in it leading onto the passage behind the rooms and it opened within a few feet of the head of the stairs .
ill talk .
shed been drinking secretly for some time .
its been a shock to you , i expect .
the other stayed outside .
gina laughed merrily .
who did she go there to meet ?
my brother was already there waiting for me .
he directed his footsteps to the kitchen as he spoke .
so she could hand in her notice and go if she wanted to ?
he lifts the window and throws the pistol (wrapped up with the telltale handkerchief in the velvet stole) into the nile .
one of a woman drawn in such a funny way , so much out of proportion , that you could hardly see she was a woman .
indeed it wasnt .
the price is still on it .
noit didnt work out that way .
i could do with a job , said macwhirter .
er i began .
it makes me remember something .
could it possibly be one of the assassins ?
she was virgo intacta , by the way .
what im telling you about happened some years ago .
mary gerrard said in a shaky voice : dont you see ?
griffin , as tuppence knew very well from her various sources of information which consisted of daily women , old isaac , gwenda in the post office and sundry others , was ninety-four .
for a moment or two he stood studying the card , and then made up his mind .
there were men who laid down their lives for their country in the war .
i know , rayi know .
strange how sordid that woman at the other end made the whole thing seem .
purely psychological .
but she told me once that she had an english husband .
mostly birds and squirrels .
then you have no idea why anyone might have sent this letter ?
its absurd .
tommy rot , said major burnaby very distinctly .
agatha christie poirot murder on the orient express .
maur her name is i wonder how she got her name ?
id rather not say it over the telephone .
anthony was determined to find that out as soon as possible .
her eyes , unfocused , swept round the walls , glanced out of the window , and occasionally closed in what appeared to be a spasm of agony .
it is such a rare thing to find .
i decided wrong , i suppose .
barton , that you areercoming back to us ?
on the outbreak of war in _num_ , mrs .
youve found out something ?
he went off by himself in the afternoon , and it was not till seven oclock that he announced that he could put it off no longer , but must break the news to the young widow .
it is a complication .
my father died when i was six years old .
then when he fired that revolver at mr .
edwards a perfect angel .
i lay awake waiting until i judged it must be about two oclock in the morning .
his english was very nearly perfect .
and really , iris , i dont think dear george would have approved .
i dont like being disturbed , said my mother .
treves politely as he set down his glass .
im not going to !
wait a moment , he advised .
im only going by what ive heard my friends say , he went on hastily .
some people say as its there still .
she would say : weve had such a nice holiday .
come along in , celia .
unfortunately , their voices were so low that she could not hear what they said .
i was very annoyed about it .
do you know who his actual mother was ?
in fact , i had a little idea as to that .
perhaps this was goodbye .
you can think fast , mr .
it is true that i am nearly blind , said esa .
was this something joyce said at the party ?
only on occasions , perhaps , said miss wills .
says things like dear little girlie .
' obviously mrs vanderlyn .
poirot gave the address of sir charless flat .
theres nothing ridiculous where murders concerned !
the telephone on the table rang sharply , and the inspector took it up with his usual portentous gravity of action .
oliver , you must know .
roared another big thickset fellow .
but i have made up my mind to put my fortune to the test .
yes , said tuppence , i have changed my opinion .
she is fond of these young peopleof some of them , that isand she would very much prefer to straighten things out by herself .
clayton went down like a log .
poirot wondered if miss brewis had been sir georges secretary prior to his marriage .
we will leave the room as it is .
she demanded breathlessly : but whose body is it ?
she was always like that , even as a tiny thing .
she was a brave woman and a truthful woman .
i was only seventeen then and i was frightened .
poirot nodded his head gravely and sadly .
poirot said : it is , perhaps , a warningnot to treat life with arrogance .
did they accept the invitation ?
morley sadly .
isnt that so ?
said kirsten .
why should i know ?
i dont want to be late at the institute .
it would be difficult for it to be anyone else , for every man here is tallvery much taller than he wasand enfin you cannot disguise heightthat , no .
_num_ monsieur jean dupont no .
he was staring curiously at mr .
i came to consult dr gerardhis opinion should be of value to meand yours , too , mademoiselleyou are young and up to date in your psychology .
presently , he seemed to get to the end of what he was saying .
having dressed , she went out onto the wide balcony outside her window .
egypt one day , palestine the next .
youve been very odd lately , mark .
then , in _num_ , neil was killed and it fell to me to tell sylvia about his last moments .
or lemonade .
he and his mother were dining alone together ; barbara was out with jim .
there was never any medical case about her .
it was another attempt , eh ?
the following day he would be starting by nairn convoy across the desert .
james kleek yelled , get altamount , juanitaquickget altamount .
i dare say , in a year or two , he might have liked to arrange for her marriage himselfthough more likely he wouldntgentlemen are usually rather selfish .
but he is still a murderer !
zeropoulos seemed doubtful .
in the blaze of the evening light he looked , not a man , but a young god , a hero god out of some northern saga .
oh dear , i must think of what im doing .
didnt she give the other woman any hint ?
do not hesitate to write to me if any point puzzles you .
his voice sounded amused .
oh , that was because wed had an argument , said lola .
when she saw simon she wanted himand she just took him .
it was after i let you know i followed you to estoril .
she sat down in the drawing room , and closed her eyes for a minute , breathing rather fast .
these things can be dangerous , you know .
i just wanted to say that ifif you are ever in trouble , anything that i can do he took her hand in his , held it tightly for a minute , then dropped it and walked rapidly away towards the casino without looking back .
is it grief ?
but he could not help feeling that they were going to happenand to him and frankie .
she used it and recognized its convenience but she was not fond of the telephone .
and i heard amyas cry out : not on your life .
no , said miss marple , you are quite right there .
the pretty face looked more like a weasels than ever .
clarissa exclaimed , as she sat and faced him on the other side of the table .
you know much , raoul , but even you do not know all it means .
and then he strangled her , said neele .
it is understood .
i like gardening myself and i like preparing for a festivity like this one tomorrow .
youve been married before , i understand .
it is absurdimprobableit cannot be .
his first wife , you know , ran away from him .
i comprehend that there is a trapyes , said poirot gently .
the crudeness of my class .
radnor strode across to the window and pulled aside the blind , then shrank back with an oath .
i wanted to reassure her , to help her .
evelyn hope !
south african concessions , mines , mineral deposits .
elsie holland sounded , not unnaturally , very much surprised .
but when i saw you , i knew hed been lucky .
he , too , was invested with a terrific english sense of duty .
a new fear gripped at his heart .
look here a little moment !
she made this extravagantly untruthful statement of her feelings without even a blush .
near the desk , by the stove of period porcelain , were paperback editions of certain preachings and tenets by the modern prophets of the world .
poirot watched her carefully before proceeding .
then you shall have peace and contentment here .
welli shouldnt say intellect was her strong point .
he went out rapidly , shutting the door loudly behind him .
you dont really know a lot about murderers , though , do you , my sweet ?
she had joined imhotep at his request to discuss the question of renisenbs marriage before he himself spoke to his daughter .
a kind of kink .
below them the sea showed a deep-glowing green .
name of a play , he said quickly .
' it was at this moment that colonel clappenon , who had not been at dinner , came in and sat down next to general forbes .
good pure air .
so i would go home with them , and we would arrive about half-past two to be greeted by sam the dogbody like a barrel , breath like a drainpipe , as noonie used to describe himand somewhere there would be some kind of meal being kept hot and we would have it .
judith that night looking , so someone had said , like her namesake before she cut off the head of holofernes .
he shut the door carefully behind him .
a voice made her jumpa somewhat raucous one .
he held up the telegram and read : definitely a vermeer .
it is more subtleyes !
they usually do .
no , he couldnt ask her .
her beautiful lithe body quivered .
the inspector looked at his watch .
the real truth is that i simply havent dared to tell the inspector what actually happened on saturday evening .
while she was engaged in doing this , the panel slowly opened and pippa emerged from the recess , wearing a dressing-gown over her pyjamas .
knighton was looking at her with cold british disapproval .
don ' t tell me the cells of your nose are equally superior to anyone else ' s .
i dont feel quite equal to going on travelling and all that .
you like young people .
they would have to have also eyes and ears .
the idea seemed to amuse her hugely .
' ' no , she died some years ago .
you enjoy your evenings of free discussion and comradeship ?
i never met a man before whose eyes were really green like a cats .
dacres , captain dacres , miss wills , miss sutcliffe , lady mary lytton gore , miss lytton gore , oliver manders .
they say that charles i walks up and down the terrace with his head under his armi have forgotten why , im sure .
lance looked alert .

whither away so fast ?
his expression did not alter .
hercule poirot did not speak .
no , he said nothing at all .
oliver , i suppose i am all right again .
he said rather absently : nono , of course not .
it was certainly not the gun that had killed john christow .
they must know or suspectbut theyre not telling .
todayor at most the day afteri would have told you the truth .
i can hardly believe there is a man capable of deliberately poisoning eight people with the object of removing one amongst them .
on the other hand , not to call them in was to acquiesce in the loss of some of the gems of his collection .
he was wearing a neat grey flannel suit , but his shirt collar was crumpled and his tie askew and his hair stood up on end in an unruly fashion .
against that view (surely the commonsense one) i could only set my own inherent belief in poirots acumen .
at least , not really ill , but not strong , and hed done everything for her .
_num_ introduction to peter saunders : the mousetrap man ( _num_ ) .
i cried , and , seizing the pencil again , i said : look !
fortescue was dead .
would clare come up and have tea with her quietly that afternoon ?
you surely dont think that lady stubbs ?
whats a funny thing ?
do you think hate can last as long as that ?
or suspicion on one side and consciousness of guilt on the other and vice versa and as you were and as you like it .
indeed , not even the principal one .
it said , prepare to die .
suzanne looked at me for a long time .
our fair guest hesitated .
but ellis is always on the cautious side .
neat white curtains at the windows , he noted , and a well-polished brass knocker .
by the ambulance was sitting a figure not unlike herself , also weeping , a monumental figure in black velvet and bugles .
as you say , threatening is not doing .
roger bassington-ffrench is dead .
its definitely a crime passionel .
in the same way , later , mr .
very well , replied richard rather unwillingly .
they give you an hour for the meal .
and yes ?
iris said quietly : he dances very well .
the fierce joy of creation possessed him .
this poor boy hereshe indicated jimmybeing shotand everything so dreadful , but so exciting .
depend upon it , that was it .
im sure moira would have enjoyed that very much .
us had signed one what time of day was that ?
well , we , think we are .
i dont know why it is , said mr .
no hurry at all really , said giles cheerfully .
he was a man of whom nearly everybody was a little afraid .
look here , mary , theres the deuce of a mess .
and some of the gang are all right .
you did not see a cat ?
several crescents in portlebury .
i should never have left it .
something about who would have thought the old gentleman had so much blood in him .
a desk , a couch , an armchair and an ordinary chair , a stethoscope on a side table and some machine that she thought had to do with eyes .
and i said to odell , why wherever can mrs .
the mere mention of a body nearly sent rose off again , but i quelled her with a stern eye and she poured out a cup of inky fluid .
sir joseph said frankly : i know youre a tip-top man at this sort of thing .
some moments passed , and then her manner appeared to change .
most circumspect .
id been having an awful dream , and then i half woke up .
there was about her a kind of medieval simplicitya strange innocence that could be , poirot thought , more devastating than any voluptuous sophistication .
twononearer three months .
the results are apparent long after , sometimes , they say .
he looked at them , but said it was impossible to say offhand what might or might not be connected with the matter in question .
wade suddenly .
she was looking as though she expected to see me and there was love in her face .
why should you think that , dr .
renisenb looked at kait without speaking .
trent , mr .
he was angry .
miss morley said with a sigh and in obvious capital letters : that boy is a sad trial .
she turned her head towards her husband .
so he really was ill ?
fancy sitting her up like that .
perhaps , i said sapiently , you doubt her being really a russian .
youve probably seen them at kew .
nothing but thrillers or wild west stories .
mcgillicuddys story .
he was young and very fair and thin with an odd face , a face that was askew somehow .
were just making a tour of the island so to speak .
sheila perenna alone took no part in the conversation , but that might be put down to her habitual taciturnity .
soup , grilled sole , pheasant and chipped potatoes , chocolate souffl , soft roes on toast .
they left mr .
never mind if it has nothing to do with the tragedy .
a millionaire several times over , murmured kramenin .
he has come here for close on ten years nowhes a kind of landmark in the place .
a problem is not necessarily unsolvable because it has remained unsolved .
when i last saw the picture there was no boat there .
i mean , one wants to say : all right then , write it yourself if you want it that way !
thats true , isnt it , jason ?
leidners personality .
now that he is a secretary to an american millionaire , it is a very different matter .
barnard and got an exact account from her as to the hour at which mr .
she is better on the business side .
i bet theres no bath and no sanitation except an e .
i wondered that she had ever had the nerve to do murder .
but nobody else went in .
she sighed again .
cant she foresee that were in for a sticky time ?
he altered his course , rowing inshore .
theres nothing the matter , is there ?
well , i dont suppose youll like what im going to say now , said mrs .
and in the end ill strike it .
no , no , hastings , you are not helping me .
the question came sharply , and everyone in the room noted the hesitation before the butler replied .
nobodys really got much of an alibi , what with the band and the dancing and the coming and going .
there was a pause , and then the inspector repeated , id like to speak to jan , please .
the operation went off all right .
lytcham roche wishesfor after all i have other affairs , and m .
that will not remove the scratches , mademoiselle , poirot shook his head sadly .
i had already learned that you had once been left a pekinese dog and had an invalid sister .
and even more than the lake , the boathouse !
not when im looking at her but when shes looking at me because its when shes looking at me that it shows , whatever it is .
an exciting housea house that lived up to expectation !
i drove her to the edge of endurance .
he will not find it difficult to turn a middle-aged lady inside out .
i shall need your co-operation .
strete might have known something about murder from the point of view of the victim .
too much energy .
yes , yes , under this light here .
egypt , i feel , must have affected you physically .
vi sit down , snell , said major riddle in a friendly tone .
he shook his head in a vexed manner .
until that moment , whatever we agreed might have happenedwed nothing to go upon but a pretty theory .
japp stopped , and poirot nodded , and said with the relish of the specialist : une belle affaire !
he looked thoughtfully at a signet ring he held in his hand , before replacing it in the drawer where he had found it .
im so terribly frightened theres an enemy here .
we saw it in the paper .
i dont know , i am sure .
it was your project , wasnt it ?
my mother added this letter to it .
let me impress upon you what so few people in this country seem to understand .
i saw a reporter at the inquest .
i who speak to youi know the murderer of mr .
for murderone would need a very strong motive .
you heard it , didnt you ?
all the same , said dr .
he paused and went on : will you trust me , my child , to do the best i can for you in your bitter trouble ?
its a bad thing to be as dependent as that on anyone .
now , please , renisenb , ive got to see that theyre marking the date properly on the linen .
fourteen of the eighteen stories collected herein are narrated by captain arthur hastings including what would appear to be the earliest poirot short story , the affair at the victory ball , which follows soon on the events of the mysterious affair at styles .
thats just the transfer , said pennington .
the other was a phrase uttered by tressilian , the butler .
' ' prepared for what ?
sophia paused .
they have been arrested ?
it seems all quite simple .
lord mayfield said in more measured tones : _num_ ' i think , m .
that , my friend , will be in the newspapers tomorrow morning .
shell never know her father was a murderer .
how ridiculous of me .
i took them all three off the tram with me to work uponand walked up barton road muttering to myself just as in the days of the kittens .
that would certainly prove the truth of the theory , said the chief constable dryly .
one cheek was disfigured by a scar , and i remembered that her husband and coworker had been killed in an explosion in the laboratory three years before , and that she herself had been terribly burned .
always , when i have had a big case , he has been by my side .
hemming , the blands , the mcnaughtons , miss waterhouse .
i will assign you your various stations .
unrelated incidents and people whirled round in space .
said bex .
mcgintys former dwelling , the front doorstep of which was at present occupied by two unpleasant little kiddles who were happily torturing a cat .
is this your wife ?
but when youre shooting a picture everythings taken out of sequence .
oh , well , i suppose you can look round .
as to the work , there was no other epigraphist attached to the expedition .
you couldnt push him , you know .
it does not concern you in the least .
a most stimulating conversationalist .
ever since the time she was a child .
it may have been that someone thought he was the only person who knew what his wife had done , or his mother or his daughter or his son .
oh , well , jules here will compose for you a little meal that will be a poempositively a poem !
we just want to get some times quite clear .
and here you are wandering about the back streets of crowdean .
she massaged me and then read aloud till i felt sleepy .
i miss you very much .
knowing what you do , how can you love me ?
what a wonderful time it was for the people who employed him .
i didnt think youd mind , sir , not as it was the missus .
its turned out to be an empress instead and aunt carolines naturally annoyed about it .
thats just a word of warning .
merrilees was trying to wrench his arm from jamess grasp .
no , clarissa replied .
i have described my suitorsbut , rather unfairly , have not commented on the fact that i , too , lost my heart .
i couldnt riski was determined not to riskmarinas knowing that an attempt had been made on her life .
nick , she said .
he said that he would kill me if i did not tell him where the jewels were .
just living here with camilladear thing though she is .
she didnt play up to him .
im mad even to think of such a thing .
chester made a few conventional remarks to him on the subject of the view and the likelihood of the weather keeping fine .
the third girl giggled .
a lucky breakdown for me .
lor , miss , what a beyewtiful book you might make out of it alljust like the pictures !
folliat went through a door on the left into a small daintily furnished sitting room and on into the big drawing room beyond , which was full of people who all seemed , at the moment , to be talking at once .
neither he nor mr .
eldons sister only remembers she went off to a place in devonshireshe doesnt remember exactly who or where .
other snapshotshalf-naked on a beachher head on the lounge lizards shoulder .
because elephants , so they say , dont forget .
sheshes utterly unreasonable .
sometimes , when people say cruel things , he feels german and bitter .
tony morelli ?
we couldnt get the doctor to her .
if there were people who wished to get rid of olive betterton , there would be easier ways to do it than by wrecking a plane , i should say .
something to do with wallpaper , isnt it ?
but what does it all mean ?
i dont know exactly why you wanted me to be in the limelight whilst you watched .
after all , said huish softly .
ah , my dear fellow , said sir george , speaking briskly and cheerfully in a way that did not match his ascetic and sad appearance .
you knew ?
mycroft holmes .
she mounts the steps ; she rings the bell she comes to consult us .
home from where ?
french , arent you ?
there are women like that and she was one of them !
i know you will suggest a drink .
the golden-haired heroine , played by katherine royal (in mr .
races eyebrows lifted as his eyes asked a question of poirot .
youre interested , perhaps , inhorses ?
ive been looking after him .
arrived at paddington , bunch went to the luggage office and produced the cloakroom ticket .
whose hand had placed them there , and why ?
we handle a good deal of bona fide business , you see , explained tommy .
she displayed no embarrassmentjust a childlike eagerness .
the boat was taken in hand .
isnt the news about the colonel really too awful ?
elinor was the next of kin .
you lived in seven springs , didnt you ?
he handed them the note in question and tommy tore it open .
short , simple , easily remembered .
i told you that i was expecting someone , said mr .
there is a perfectly good case for either theory .
but it fits in very well with one idea of mine .
and now that i have reached the age of seventy-five , it seems the right moment to stop .
ill kill you .
before i could respond to that , the door opened with a rush and sophia came in .
four on curzon street the hon .
daviss dinner .
now for the other letter .
lomax has been asking for you .
whos henry ?
nigel chapman is the childish type that lacks proportion .
now , you wanted to make ato tell us something ?
i am interested .
poirot eyed him thoughtfully .
tomorrow , i shall proceed to a further experiment .
this is the second ive heard of this evening .
doyles the loveliest , the most elegant woman ive ever seen !
good night , said miss henderson .
she gave her name as venetia anne kerr , and her address as little paddocks , horbury , sussex .
like wigs and twins .
i see mrs .
they received legacies , mon cher .
the only address ive got is the hotel in london they were going tothe cleveland , i think it was called .
i like being affected , said nigel .
she no longer wanted to die .
and that is what i say again .
so that i could learn certain facts that i had to know , said miss marple .
the old man got up and with a bow left the room .
what a poisonous woman !
thats why you came here , isnt it ?
that , i think , is very unlikely , said miss marple .
directly opposite me was the side entrance to the post office , the main entrance to which is in adderley street .
she had been ill in bed and had got up specially .
oh , no , mademoiselle , people do not change !
she turned to poirot .
how is he ?
and now when i come home , having earned a little peace , there is to be fresh difficulty !
but i must go .
it can also become a habit .
it doesnt seem real , tom .
the countess , young franklin , uncompromising elizabethhe sketched them all in with a deft touch .
very well then , i make the stew .
i didnt see her come out .
i will tell you what i knowor rather what i guessed .
lancelot looked suddenly alert .
fourteen the veiled lady the veiled lady was first published as the case of the veiled lady in the sketch , october _num_ , _num_ .
there was polite disbelief in the inspectors tone .
hudd ?
i wasnt worrying about uncle roger .
and after that she is pleased with herself , and her vigilance relaxes .
wrong time of year to choose , of course , october and november , but they didnt want to wait .
he kept away from his father for many years because he could not forgive his fathers treatment of his mother .
schlsser are not standing very solidly nowadays .
yes , said philip .
he led the way and the two police officers followed him .
as to what it isthat , too , i think , is not difficult to say .
any moment she might see something moresomething she didnt want to see the house frightened her but was it the house or herself ?
she was an italian from pisa , was she not ?
inspector crome nodded , handed mr .
as a matter of curiosity , when was it sent off ?
oh yes , ive got an explanation , said miss marple .
his healths rotten , of course .
oh , thank you , said lady coote .
let her have tea in the kitchen or somewhere with the girl , said alfred .
peter lord stood up .
he smiled , he smoked , and he looked thoughtfully at henry horsham .
i exchanged a few words with her on the day she left jerusalem .
he will not die if that is what you mean .
did he give any special instructions to the butler about admitting me ?
it had been fresh and blooming an hour earlier , now it drooped .
dont tell me so , because i wont believe it .
on the side of the hill was another , smaller one .
they were very large , and there were faint shadows underneath them .
she never mentioned any enemies ?
totman enjoyed it very much .
i liked the well-cut light-grey tailor-made , and the crisp white shirt .
defeat for his purpose , defeat for that brains pool from which he had hoped to profit so greatly .
the girls squeaked and shrieked .
how absurd to say there were three !
i cant go on staying , can i , at curtiss for ever ?
i didnt hear anything at all .
however long it is , something reminds you of it , you know , and brings it all back to you .
not gentlemen , sir .
part two the evidence one the evidence of the wagon lit conductor in the restaurant car all was in readiness .
he got it out at last , and then , suddenly , his head fell back and his body went limp .
suggested orourke sympathetically .
he didnt tell me what that list was .
you have had a shock , hester .
he blotted it carefully and then came back .
the vicar had a sore throat which necessitated his speaking in a whisper when he spoke at all .
no , said lady astwell , he is not like victor .
she was glad that it was tuesday and that her guests would be going tomorrow .
i assure you the danger is very real .
shes got a nice voice .
and echo answers where ?
japp proffered a request to speak to lord edgware privately .
bauerstein , now , what was he doing up and dressed at that hour in the morning ?
nobody seems to have tried to do anything for him until the doctor came .
his mind was still puzzling over something .
no difficulty here , he said .
it was with a very faint shock that miss marple heard herself addressed as aunt jane .
i expect theyre trying all right .
entwhistlewhat ?
it was six in the morning when mr .
that is to say , weve done what we could keeping under cover .
) i believe you arrived with mrs .
there was some idea , i believe , of a years exchange with a teacher abroad .
ii well , tom , what have you got for me ?
so he could open it if he wanted to ?
a storm , he thought , might come at any minute .
i did think of it last night while the dancing and the band was going on , but i didnt like to interrupt him just then , because they were having such a merry party together and i thought i will remember to ask him for it in the morning .
the armstrong kidnapping case part two : the evidence _num_ .
griffith rings up , i cant go on tuesday , but could manage wednesday or thursday .
im sorry because im fond of bridget .
every one looked inquiringly at blore .
twenty-one the clock strikes three i miss cooke and miss barrow arrived very promptly at _num_ : _num_ .
at that moment two children burst out of the house .
a pityyes .
the princess poporensky followed her .
she was up at sittaford nosing around .
oliver of the universe , why doesnt the idiot say at once that he saw the cockatoo ?
it certainly seems , he admitted , as though miss arundell died from natural causes .
lenox accompanied him to the door .
here we are stuck in a snowdrift and nobody doing anything about it , and my boat sailing the day after tomorrow .
an incredible moustache !
davis nodded .
' hercule poirot nodded thoughtfully .
exactly how the subject started , i am not sure , but we were talking of euthanasiathe case for and against it .
and the master , he said , i dont know what to think .
it was a mental case in one family .
such a perfect pair , he so dark and she so fair .
oh , its been going on for yearsmrs .
the beach was a steeply sloping one , and on it there were eight bathing machines in the charge of an ancient man , of somewhat irascible temper , whose non-stop job was to let the machine up and down in the water .
there was a rumour as went about that his father being so rich got him wangled out of prison .
and then she diedand i was alone .
eighteen without benefit of clergy i the beach was rather empty this morning .
the fair arlena had no use for me .
i can quite see that .
instead he felt that he was sitting opposite to an exceedingly good-looking and expensively dressed woman who was also a good businesswoman .
the tariffs rather high .
as a matter of fact , though , i have a scheme .
' major eustace shrugged his shoulders .
youve not seen the last of me .
you told me you had travelled there a good deal in recent years .
or , it might be laurence , and not brenda .
several hours of acute boredom followed .
as far as that goes i began doubtfully .
but i made him go through with it .
' ' never , mademoiselle .
come on , lets go and drink indifferent coffee in peaceful surroundings .
it is so nice up thereone isoh , above everything .
what do you mean , aunt jane ?
no , rogers !
kenneth marshall nodded .
stomach contents tell us that .
perhaps the girl herself was playing truant .
i couldnt have helped her or advised her .
dear me , said anthony .
she was looking radiant this morning .
yes , they wear loose from time to time .
youll put up at thewhat is itanglers arms in staverley , hawkins .
the people were less fanatical by this time , and one could visit many of the interiors of the mosques which were inaccessible before .
she came on here yesterday .
it seemed to me she was pleased about something , sir .
im not much good in illness , i dont like ill people , and i cant bear people to be unhappy or upset .
dermot noticed that there was no question of tests , or of sir alington satisfying himself as to the conditions of the seance .
well , he demanded , youve been a long time .
some secret worry , perhaps ?
do you mean gregs going off with someone ?
so you see , said norma earnestly , it must have been me .
had a lady been to see him that evening ?
well , not disapproved exactly .
were a homely pair , but much attached to each other .
they counted on leaving no traces !
i wonder if youve got any photographs of her wedding ?
mary by mace .
lawrence cavendish was quite as strong , if not stronger than that against his brother .
someone gave himself away without meaning to do soindeed quite against his will .
oh no , someone else stabbed him .
thank goodness your hats on your head .
i will send her to you , madame .
he beamed and vociferated and , forgetting my english reluctance , embraced me warmly on the platform .
there was a surgical dressing on her left ear .
protheroe and her husband had just started for the village .
that is quite the wrong spirit , said mr .
why , let me see .
stephen lane cleared his throat and said with a trace of self-consciousness .
(mademoiselle seems very certain there is no such thingand she would surely know .
with us , she thought , with edward and me ?
to youth it seems very odd to think that age was once young and pigtailed and struggled with decimals and english literature .
i dont know what came over me .
and yet it has been told me that mrs .
here the devotees assembled just before the setting of the sun .
a three-years reference recommending her most warmly , she prefers the country , and actually asks less wages than gladys .
a vendetta of some kind ?
its beauty , the flowers and bushes , the artificial water below in the fountain , the path round it , enchanted , beautiful and entirely unexpected .
but everything that grew here had the appearance of having grown by its own will .
the girls face was faintly familiar to him .
satterthwaite looked up .
down there , said molly .
victoria looked down at the water below and edged her way round .
and she turned and ran back up the road , looking like a modern atalanta .
and yet she was killed ?
it seemed to miss marple an odd remark for someone with whom she had been conversing for some considerable time .
at gossington hall .
well , perhaps , little dear , we could make one little tap at the door .
and you were able to give us some additional identification .
jimmy shook his head and relapsed into silence .
or , if he conducted the search , he would have pretended to find the hiding place already rifled .
all round you ?
comewe must be quick !
oh , i do not doubt it , said poirot .
butbut the whole village would have seen him !
besides , theres no motive .
archie said that he thought that some of it was not very reputable .
if hed just thrown her out there by chance , hed have done no more about it , and the body would , long before now , have been found .
heart failure means your heart stops beatingthats all there is to that .
oh , quite so , yeser quite so .
does that agree with the way you would describe him ?
something quite out of the usual must have occurred , decided sir henry .
she knew that he was unreliable , she knew he was what was technically called a bad lot , but that , said miss marple , in a more ordinary tone of voice , is not what puts any girl off a boy .
mcginty was lying on the parlour floor .
clarissa called her back again , picked up the piece of bun , stuffed it in pippas mouth , took the hat , jammed it on the childs head , and pushed her into the hall .
ive got an hour to spare until the time when the students will be getting back .
i said cheerfully .
youve got to find who killed that poor girl , edna , and who played that heartless trick on sheila .
it was rather inexplicable , but i supposed that , for some reason or other , japp wished to keep it out of the papers .
hes very moody lately .
the next instant she had recognized him .
patients on the way to recovery relapsed and died .
he was a big burly man , with a closely shaven head and thick eyeglasses through which his eyes seemed to peer suspiciously .
she will forgive you enthusiastically .
was there any earthly reason why the doctor should disbelieve in her accident ?
you said youd ring her up .
its wearing me out .
he turned away and the old man called after him grudgingly : maybe youd find her in the apple orchard .
here was romance at lastand he was in it !
he said he thought not .
be warned before it is too late .
what on earth are you driving at , poirot ?
wilbraham crescent had never looked primmer .
i work as a mannequin at lucies , and i can tell you , mr .
she raised bewildered eyes to him .
however , once well away , i calmed down .
but i dont suppose i need to sing edwards praises to you , young lady ?
ask this lady if you dont believe me , he said .
said albert .
though they take them off in paris and cairo , i believe .
it was very cold .
an off-hand reply trembled on her lipsand then , quickly , her mood changed .
she examined it carefully .
two close friends i did contrive to see were sidney and mary smith .
yes , so , you see , you are cleared whether you like it or not .
shes got experience , but shes still adaptable .
remember , she came back to the camp only five minutes after raymond .
and a faintly musty smell from the kind of book that edward was sure to be reading .
we decided on italya place we had never been to before , called alassio .
made your boast good ?
franklin rents it from me and hes had it all fitted up .
it is difficult to say .
she had put on her dressing gown and come down .
you arrived here as a stranger , mr .
she has got her own latch key , of course .
too impatient .
what rumours ?
ever since they had got herewhen was that ?
phillipa heard her speaking to julia in the hall .
i wonder who these parkers are ?
rosemarys voice .
then perhaps hell find out that he didnt do it after all .
doesnt throw his weight about , but he gets there .
id like to see her .
his name might very possibly be giuseppe .
the chauffeur slowed down , and bill swung the suitcase up to him .
i just say , yes , mr .
except mrs .
she looks , you know , as though she was watching us all , and perhaps laughing in that velvet sleeve of hers .
it was superbly acted and gwenda enjoyed it very much .
at least i dont remember seeing her there .
i swallowed them down and strolled out again .
well , it is .
you want me to help you out , eh ?
sugden said : you didnt try it on at once , though .
i begin to see .
john and lawrence were in the dining room .
i tell you at onceit is in order , i hope ?
i say to myself always , can this possibly be murder ?
im going into the kitchen , she said , to see if the ovaltine has come .
when he had departed again , she asked her father about him .
well , over twenty years ago there was a love affair between two people .
lets go outside .
i was quite a young man at the time .
yahmose shrugged his shoulders .
and ill tell you what , said ronny handsomely , ill get one for pongo .
money again , im afraid .
someone today mentioned to me othello .
' _num_ poirot ' s eyebrows rose slightly , but even had he wished he would have had no time to make a comment for valentine chantry came sweeping out , crying in her high voice : ' douglas - a pink gin - positively i must have a pink gin .
and verity hunter or hunt was educated at that school .
it is my city , kerbela , said carmichael .
yes , wasnt it .
did she die down here ?
it was a rolls he came in .
its a terrible thing .
you see , he sounds to me just the sort of person who would do a murder .
for the next theatre venture , christie collaborated with gerald verner to adapt towards zero , a murder mystery she had written ten years previously .
he saw the hand clench on her knee , the tightening of the line of the jaw , yet the answer came in a matter-of-fact voice free from emotion .
well , ask him if tomorrow will do ?
it wouldnt be fatal in anyone elses case , of course , but no one would be surprised at one victim because , as dr .
i used to arrive at the fifth storey completely out of breath , as indeed was only natural .
i thoughtyes , i definitely thought he had something on his mind .
he can always bring up a message if necessary .
i thought this jane marple business with rafiel might have something to do with michael .
darling , of course you didnt !
it was merely a journalist letting off steam and trying to make things rather more important than they were .
ackroyd would enjoy being referred to as the old lady .
george went on : but about this young fellow , anthony browne .
pretty nearly everyone to do with that case is dead .
hysterical people dont usually commit suicide .
clearly there was more to follow .
he was a character because of his agehe claimed to be ninety (not generally believed)and he was able to do repairs of many curious kinds .
miss marple pushed her breakfast tray farther away with a purposeful gesture .
what exactly do you mean by that , i wonder ?
that filling is wearing down a littlenothing serious , though .
raikes shook his head .
so she says nothing .
i suppose youve been told what has occurred here ?
egg drew her breath in sharply .
he brought two glasses and , sitting down by poirot , he went on : she used to come once a week to do extra cleaning .
asked sir montague depleach .
when i awoke , he was sitting at the table writing .
she appeared to be a very nice womanintelligent and sympathetic .
no more nonsense , i said .
my special miracle .
thomas royde was just preparing to move forward , but by now nevile , after a moments pause , had followed audrey out of the window .
and , of course , its not as though i havent been able to make myself usefulyou really need a secretary at a time like this , and miss protheroe doesnt do anything to help , does she ?
yet i wondered more and more what had brought such a woman as mrs .
cavendishs clear voice startled me .
he admires you ; but he is intelligent !
i shouldnt wonder if they elected me mayor in a week .
after a little politeness in the matter of procedure , aprs vous , monsieur .
at that moment julius rejoined him .
lets make plans .
but it surprises me that anyone else in england should even have heard of him .
often it is not a style that suits you , and so you write badly .
miss barrowby , mr .
what did he do ?
thats living .
poirots spring forward was not quick enough .
he got the stuff from somewhere and she gave it to the master , that was the way of it , ive no doubt .
cried charles suddenly .
she was silent for a moment and then with a sudden brusque gesture , she stretched out for her handbag , opened it , took out a piece of paper and thrust it into his hand .
the others nothingi dont suppose i shall ever see her again .
poirot was studying her attentively .
small neat figurescareful addition and subtractionthat is miss merediths score .
after all , she chose to marry that dreadful young man .
never mind your luggage .
miss horsefall waved a cigarette .
there wasnt anything hidden there , i can tell you that .
nick lifted her tear-stained face .
her husband came in just then , and she immediately demanded confirmation from him .
you have added imagination , a result seen in the minds eye , that you have managed to raise the money to fulfil .
imhotep , drawing himself up , replied rather shame-facedly : oh , so you have heard ?
ach , no .
you and your uppish mr .
we dont really neglect the obvious , he pointed out .
oh , you have some leisure time ?
she cooked magnificently .
im sincerely sorry , lady horbury ; but , you see , this is a very serious matter .
is that what youre thinking ?
going down into the tubes and spending the nights there .
but i can only assure you , inspector hardcastle , that i had no need for a stenographer and did notrepeat notring up this cavendish place with any such request .
because , as yo have just told me , there was a gas fiye in her room .
he left roger graham in his room and went downstairs .
a lot of additional pain and grief is caused by honesty , remarked hercule poirot .
you are eternally young , said ivor gallantly .
they board with mrs .
i had a list of names , i went out and i shepherded people in .
it sounded perfectly scientific .
arent you a clever cook ?
leidner is waiting .
the real stones are still in the necklace .
no , its not so simple as that .
i join him immediately .
jethroe .
what three people ?
no , it would be the opposite .
by all accounts , its the kind of situation he loves above all , and he always manages to come out on top .
still , thats all no credit to the department .
he looked tired , but strangely peaceful .
poirot fairly danced with impotent excitement .
i thought it was not so much that he needed the money but he wanted to test me out , to see if i lent money easily .
my instructions are to deliver the manuscriptnot to your amiable society , but to a certain firm of publishers .
sarah felt that behind the mask of conventional words they understood each other .
thats all right , my son .
you yourself , if i may say so , seem to be rather a dark horse .
now your attachment goes back many years .
where has my true love gone from me ?
he whistled .
a gentleman has called to see you .
i thought that i was doing quite well .
why dont you take it ?
she had paid out very considerable sums of money several times to protect him from the consequences of his actions .
got herself into trouble .
look here , charles , i take all responsibility on myself .
little willie here travels round with me everywhere .
but captain warburton and his megaphone bore down upon him .
i feel like that sometimes , too , said victoria .
though he didnt get much result from josephine , whose voice sounded as though she had a cold in the head , eustace sounded quite different from his usual moody self .
yes , yes , you must help me .
it came to him in a flash .
the last man in the world .
perhaps , after a cup of tea the cup of tea arrived almost as the thought came to her .
also , the ending of the play is different from that of the novel .
i had a look at his prescriptions upstairs and it seems quite clear that he was in a very precarious state of health .
again in a sick wave of memory poirot thought of those words uttered in assuan .
as usual she sat and knitted and listened to what went on , and very occasionally joined in the conversation .
i will admit i thought them quite hors de combat .
reilly went off to the hospital , and mr .
to steal the pearls at such a moment invites a close search of everybody on board .
then we went down a couple of fifties trying for four hearts and four spades .
he looked round scornfully .
but since i have been thinking well ?
something like three or four hundred thousand pounds she left .
satterthwaite miss hermione lytton gore clothes by ambrosine ltd illumination by hercule poirot first act suspicion one crows nest mr .
the old woman had said then : itll never be your land and itll never belong to you .
my thoughts flew to mary cavendish , and i hedged : in what way ?
my wifes aunt ?
she used to come down late on a saturday night after the show , i suppose .
he read first aristide leonides letter and then the will itself .
he returned slowly to his chair .
wouldnt be all these silly women forever leaving their handbags around .
ii colonel pikeaway , his bulk sprawled out in his chair in the small room in bloomsbury where he sat from ten to five with a short interval for lunch , was surrounded as usual by an atmosphere of thick cigar smoke ; with his eyes closed , only an occasional blink showed that he was awake and not asleep .
mr oliver costello of _num_ , morgan mansions , london sw _num_ .
sarah blushed guiltily , hoping lady westholme had not overheard much of that conversation .
what do you say , poirot ?
was he saying something particular to you , my dear ?
she knew who nigel really was .
sir rowland thought for a moment , and then asked sharply , where is pippa now ?
but in a way , being tied physically gives you lots of scope mentally .
its a perfect timekeeper .
most people , sooner or later .
i admired the polite way that mrs .
one hardly has to imagine anything to explain oneself .
i am appealing to you , madame , as a woman of intelligence with plenty of good sense and judgment .
personally i always seem to lose it .
of course claude , poor fellow , hasnt many brains .
it was such funsuch funeven now i can remember what fun it was .
charles was fluent and persuasive .
rumours about him and a patient .
they have not the uneasy suspicion of the travelling briton .
i am not serious !
now , watch this , onetwothreea bit tricky with gloves .
they spotted it almost at once .
i wont take it .
suddenly he turned and left the room .
there is , for instance , this place , gilling , where mr .
but otherwise there was no cultivation , and no signs of life .
theres a couple of men herecome from a newspaper , so they say .
they sat down at a little table and ordered the inevitable tea that south africa drinks at all hours of the day and night .
wellthats that .
i hear nothing , i tell you .
chantry , for instance yes , mrs .
everything seemed to go wrongnot with the worki mean with usour tempers and our nerves .
rymer snorted .
my specialized knowledge of authors requirements came in very useful .
' yes , mademoiselle ?
my job is to make the unfit fit .
nothing more nor less than a dead body , in fact .
there are students there of both sexes ?
ah , he said , i must look into the matter .
grainger , he laughed , and said faith was worth all the drugs ever invented .
a free pardon thats come too late for him .
from the murder of cora lansquenet herself .
ruth might have gone all peculiar and refused to divorce him or something .
you have remained on outwardly good terms with your husbands mother , deeming that the best thing to be done , but inwardly you have judged and condemned her .
i daresay theyd have called the next one dorothy may .
and all so complex , nearly all so trivial and if one thing isnt trivial , its so hard to spot which onelike a needle in a haystack .
he saw very little response in the face opposite him or might it , he said , be something more than that ?
dont tell me youre conrads niece , or daughter , or anything , because i cant believe it .
he twirled his moustaches .
drake ?
templeton , is much younger than the husband , and he has a son by his first marriage who lives there .
chief inspector neele and i have known each other for many years .
throw that filthy chloride of lime preparation away !
for on an earlier occasion the going up of the lights had coincided with the discovery of a dead body lying across the table .
im being stupid .
spying a bell inset on the mahogany counter , spence pressed it .
its rather a habit of yours , i suspect , said calgary .
one feels unchristianthough really i dont think that that is a logical reason for suppressing the truth .
he was a right-handed man , was he not ?
she said : because , any minute now , your husband may be arrested for murder .
at four oclock she has been angry , but completely mistress of herself .
going to the table , he took a quick sip from each glass .
leonides was either very stupidor possibly very clever .
miss bell , young and hopeful , said : we ought to give him some mustard and waternow .
the answer is that alf is the black sheep of the family .
there was something rather sinister about that van , it was so very black .
as she left her room she coughed , and from opposite came the sound of a highly histrionic sneeze .
but i wish to god id been the one to get it in the neck .
if he were a tall man of swarthy complexion he could never have passed himself off as the fair , stocky doctor .
what do they want to come over here for , and pick out all the best girls ?
you cant change people .
she disliked him very much .
starkwedder rose from the arm of the sofa .
thenceforward , he strenuously , and quite uselessly , upheld the theory of death from natural causes .
no suspicion of anything but suicide arose .
to hilary it all had an unreal quality .
poirot left stephen to explain and he hurriedly slipped away along the passage to the other end of the house .
we cant make a plan of our own !
but you dont feel sure that they are ?
major burnaby ?
i dare say there isn ' t anything really wrong .
i cant say that at the moment ive any idea at all .
take her into the house , hastings , said poirot .
you are cruelcruel cried renisenb .
but theyre not real , she would protest .
how pathetically young and pleased he looked .
awaking with a start , i suddenly realized what had brought the cat so forcibly into my thoughts .
he was excited .
he said anyone with intelligence ought to be able to solve a little problem like that .
as a matter of fact i dropped a spot of hair oil on my dressjust on the shoulder here .
i dont know what youre driving at .
a creole i dont mean a half-caste , but one of those old intermarried familes ah , here we are , its all set out in here .
samuelson , rearranging her handsome diamond bracelet and turning her rings on her fingers , think of nothing but money .
simon looked at him with admiration .
lynn marchmont , he thought , was essentially a modern typethough one might , with equal accuracy , call it an elizabethan type .
redfern murmured : you like watching the people too , i think ?
it was really a most remarkable dream !
excellently .
he came here to visit us when he was passing through once .
she paused and then blurted out : as a matter of fact , i made a fool of myself .
very civil , i must say .
then , with a good many bows and gesticulations on poirots part , we bade farewell to the lady and got away .
the russians declared so .
naturally a big firm of wholesale manufacturers typewrite their letters .
he smiled to himself .
lemprire thoughtfully .
east africa , south americasimply everywhere , i believe .
porters all righta dull dog , thoughanother of these african hunters , all sunburnt and silent .
in the middle of the room was a good-sized plain oak table with a blotter and inkstand and a small attach case .
you are travelling from baghdad , i believe , miss debenham ?
rycroft , slowly ascending the steep slope of the lane from the post office , paused , till ronnie overtook him .
yes , yes , thats true enough .
recluse , suggested tuppence .
there are ways of doing that , and reubens was not the right way .
its our land and our house .
of course , i realize its perfectly all right .
he handed one to his wife .
i must say i find it very curious that he should not have done so .
judith butler was a woman of about thirty-five , and whilst her daughter resembled a dryad or a wood nymph , judith had more the attributes of a water-spirit .
she bustled out purposefully .
wetherby .
he himself had never brought a solution of physostigmine into the house or into his wifes room and he thought that by no possibility could she have taken it accidentally .
this remark seemed to me quite irrelevant .
ye-es , said tommy doubtfully .
the car fairly leapt forward .
husband and wife have a terrific scene , ending in a distinct threat on carolines part , and yet , twenty minutes or so later , she goes down and starts a trivial domestic argument .
meets today !
one never knows what shes going to say or feel about things .
miss waynflete , however , clutching her hat with one hand , walked by his side with every appearance of enjoyment , talking as she went in little gasps .
the chief of them is that my client would not have liked it .
she seemed , as usual , quite sure of herself .
this place is in a hollow .
here , it was clear , miss gilchrist was in her element .
nothing wrong with her .
he mentions the fayumgood sport there such and such a year , such and such a month .
they can go on shooting each other .
oh , im sure i never said anything of the kind , lola laughed .
but i dont know how much hethe person took in .
that is right , madame .
his aunt , my mother , is dead .
this is locked .
i said books , she said .
you simply work yourself up and its you !
this is the second article i took from m .
this marrascaud , you know , is a fantastic creature !
but you can see , madam , what a nice boy he is .
i wrote as bidden .
you remember , hastings ?
i bet shes stuffed edward up with some tale or other and the goop has believed her .
to watch her face when i ask her one question , he replied at last .
you thought so then ?
i was utterly bewildered , but i had faith in poirot .
she smiled sweetly , said goodnight again and went out of the room .
the secret that he did not confide to his wife , it is possible that he may have told it to the woman whose love held him enslaved .
like a swarm of bees .
i dont know why , said julia , but somehow it makes me want to laugh .
it depended , sir , on his mood .
one of them brought food and drink and offered it to me , but i waved them aside .
we got together on the subject of dancing , and i would repair to the mellors house to practise with him on their stairs , which were more suitable than ours , being shallower and wider .
brains , sympathy .
she filled up the teapot .
tell me , mon enfant , have you a young man ?
was she dark or fair ?
how did she find out ?
you killed her killed helen iknow now .
he kissed her .
he poked his head forward .
that was mr .
they were about a quarter of an inch in diameter and certainly had the effect of having been freshly made .
the evil man nowadays may be the successful man of the past .
the swedish lady seemed agitated , mary debenham calmly indifferent .
rub a dub dub , three men in a tub and who do you think they be ?
hallo , my dear .
she had a repertoire of six , all centred on the various children of the families with which she had lived .
miss bennett asked him .
and those fragments ?
i wish i could think of something to help you .
ive got all her beautiful pictures , you know , and a lovely amethyst brooch , but i feel that perhaps i ought to give that back to you .
he says that it is seriously affecting his health .
ill have to have a course of some kind , said nick .
this is terrible .
poirot continued to play the torch for some minutes longer , walking the entire length of the terrace and back .
she was only trying to be kind , richard .
there is another possible solution of the crime .
theyll be back any minute .
at the end of that period , my wits having been proved better than hers , the house and all my uncles large fortune pass to various charitable institutions .
if you hadnt id never have seen through you .
hughs the only son .
and yet i was a pretty girl oncenot so long ago as youd think , either .
' ' plenty .
whos uncle andrew ?
the sooner i saw the last of her the betterthats what i said !
but you will recall that i mentioned an empty box of bromide powders .
that , also , can be understood .
she is much better when she arrives here .
and who was mr .
any women in his life ?
i think she was ashamed of having done it .
and then , quite suddenly , that lost bit of my life came back .
a chicken , of course , i said wearily .
sullivan was still poirot , but hastings was now played by roland culver , and dr carelli by dino galvani .
thats all right , he remarked .
now what on earth do you mean by that , tommy ?
from time to time i had doubts in my own mind as to whether i would ever be tough enough to carry out these programmes .
they think its freer , you know , and a gayer life .
poor richard .
i suppose well have to leave it at suicide .
constable hoskins cleared his throat .
i was told the other day on very high authority indeed that the germans cant possibly last out more than another two months .
father will buy a woolly lamb for his little maisiekins .
she looked at me in momentary doubt .
but tell me about her .
he said with a sigh , how difficult it is to know the right thing to do .
and just for a minute i saw her eyelids quiver and blink .
that ' s all for the present .
youve got your wish , i should say , said miss peabody , drily .
he sat , his long legs stretched out , looking somehow incongruous in faithful florences somewhat overfurnished parlour .
the strong man can on occasions be discreet .
i told you these particular neighbours were a wash-out on the contrary .
why is race so anxious that i should go to joburg ?
within that list , if my theory is correct , there must be the name of the murderer .
i will listen , said allegra .
venables was at home .
small cups of a treacly and muddy liquid called black coffee were served not in the coffee room but in the lounge .
was it the usual ordinary brutal type of crime ?
you have returned to the train .
that , said miss marple , would be very convenient for everybody .
jeremy , noticing her glance , sat back innocently and crossed his legs as the inspector continued , apparently this miss peake was the last person to see him .
you mustnt , i said , be morbid .
oliver , it must be marvellous to write .
it is a pity , murmured poirot .
its not so easy to get hold of morphia .
it was from madame olivier , the world-famous scientist , whom we had visited yesterday in connection with the halliday case .
shall you call upon him , and make your apologies in person ?
we dont seem to be getting on very fast , said norman gale .
astwell , secretly studying the amazing moustache of the other gentleman , and deciding that they looked an unlikely pair to be friends , volunteered further information .
i still feel the pictures all wrong , sir .
as i said just now , one couldnt turn away a dog on a night like this .
that is the difference between us .
english roads are hopeless , of course .
she had had a friend , an elderly woman , with whom she had corresponded intermittently , giving news of her life in england .
but most importantly , prejudice comes under the cosh .
i believe you may be lucky there , m .
i shant , i replied cheerfully .
i didnt answer itdash it all , satterthwaite , i didnt dare answer itthe girl had no idea , of course , but i didnt want to make a fool of myself .
$ _num_ .
what about it , edna ?
he hasnt had this mornings post .
i cant remember what we were saying .
he had taken for granted that albert had already been dealt with by the mysterious stranger .
hannibal sniffed at the trophy just disinterred from the inside of cambridge .
lets get to work , said virginia .
you said it was an impulse on your part .
she was skinny .
basil west had turned green .
today is only the _num_ th .
you dont have to buy anything , i assured her .
lombard of administering poison ?
hercule poirot went quietly out of the room .
as mr .
you didnt tell her who you were ?
he had questioned the cook , and she had admitted that one or two of the mushrooms cooked had been a little queer , but as the shop had sent them she thought they must be all right .
albert suspected no irony .
what good can it possibly do ?
for reasons of economy she did not take a bus .
indeed , said miss marple thoughtfully .
blunt will take this case on for you .
one cannot make an omelette , they say , without breaking eggs .
but perhaps it was as well tonight .
he detailed them carefully .
i know lots of places where i can run across her .
the boldness of the crime !
i thought she was upstairs and heard him .
now , do you see the point ?
and he said he had been rottenly placed at dinner .
did you take a photograph of him ?
i had probably seen her as a small child , but i only remember her when she came to london about a year later .
then dinner andim not ashamed to say itreread a book of e .
poirot sighed : you read too much detective fiction .
her life shall not be tainted by the cruel past .
he keeps tabs on whats going on over here , and when he knows that youve left norfolk and come to this part of the world , he makes his plans .
in one case the son took on .
bathing photos , a villa set amidst mimosa .
come , we will go into the bar .
conditions : do not worry lovely cousin rosemarydo not contaminate innocent cousin irisdo not embarrass worthy cousin george .
not a fool then , after all !
we were working our way slowly along the wall when a sound came to our ears of a breaking twig .
nothing much to eatjust some toast .
thats understood .
then i met another man .
tomorrow may be too late , said sir james gravely .
i mean , they just throw all of us adults out .
well , what is your opinion ?
i daresay it would have been different if they had .
it could have been simply swallowed in its tablet form ?
i paused outside the door of his sitting room .
if you did , they became rattled , repeated themselves , and generally took twice as long .
why about her husband ?
well , thats certainly unusual .
sir claud , who , in the normal course of things , would not have gone to that safe until the following day , has discovered his loss by a mere chance .
because shes one removed from the family , you mean ?
the tenant in question proved to be a mrs .
you know , egg , you really are detestably hearty .
a ladder-like stair lead to two rooms above , with a sketchy bathroom and another tiny room next to that .
that described pongo down to the ground .
i just happened to see her name in the paper .
or to hermia with her calm good sense .
i am sorry , said the inspector .
not that my hearing is bad .
baths and hot and cold basins in all the bedrooms and a good many gilded electric-light fittings .
he was speaking now as he might have spoken to a business adversary .
victim , murdereryouall complete with the weapon .
he had caught up my little dagger paper knife from the dressing table and was holding it with the point just over his heart .
later he drank intensely black coffee , served in a pot without a lid .
, said alfred , and disappeared .
he says victor was quite brazen about the whole thing .
anything you please .
with the presence of mr .
i am very tired , she said .
so presumably i ought to be hanged .
then , i see , he said , his anger rising .
' undoubtedly ?
i hope you will answer it as truthfully as you can .
there is a balcony , of course .
carter slewed round in his chair .
alan sat in front of the desk staring with unseeing eyes out of the window for a long time .
he has just returned from those great clear open spaces , etc .
sunny ridge , its called .
simon looked amused .
i did not see anyone i knew , if thats what you mean .
yes , james , or whatever his name is .
the whole general effect reminded him of someone or somethingbut for the moment he could not recollect who or what it was .
she was waiting for him in the drawing room .
on the following afternoon , she got into her car and went to see her invalid aunt .
to a man of dr gerards tact making the acquaintance of mr cope presented few difficulties .
theres something in the wind .
i was mad about hercrazyshe seemed everything that was adorable and sweet , and all the time she was what she is now vulgar , vicious , spiteful , empty-headedi cant even see her loveliness now .
its not for yourself , bella , its for the sake of the children .
half the nurses in our hospitals seem to be black nowadays , said miss lemon doubtfully , and i understand much pleasanter and more attentive than the english ones .
guilty of her death i may be , in the sense that i gave her a shockthat , of course , presupposes a natural death .
what proof have you of that ?
what time did sir carmichael usually come back from his walk ?
vera and emily brent were busy , miss brent was raking out the stove .
i suppose really it was poor daddy dying so unexpectedlyit was so horribly sudden .
victoria said slowly : like rupert crofton lee ?
that wound wasnt inflicted after deathit was the cause of death , and you need make no mistake about it .
she looked down at her finger and twisted the wedding ring on it absently .
she lost her head and stabbed him .
i wonder if there is anything between young lawrence redding and lettice protheroe , said miss wetherby .
if ellen had been listening outside the door she had managed to disappear very swiftly .
you went to his house ?
tanios frowned , then she said slowly : i dont think i like the idea very much .
like an idiot , i stood for several minutes taking in the fog effect in the headlights and thinking what id use to get that effect on a stage .
i mean , you couldnt hide anything in a bottle of bay rum .
said japp to me as i accompanied him to the door .
wed argued and argued .
hadn ' t seen each other since , i believe .
spirited , i said , feeling more kindly towards mary .
its the business of the police .
blood is thicker than water ; and madame had no friends .
and he said : whats all this ?
my dear fellowwhat an alarmist you are !
i could think of nothing more insufferable than members of ones own gang dropping in full of sympathy and their own affairs .
she nodded reassuringly at her husband .
that really was rather beastly .
yes , edmunds was saying so at the athenaeum this evening .
they dont lock you out , i hope ?
asked poirot , speaking for the first time .
the conference will be at whitehall tomorrow , he informed her , but it would be a great advantage if a conversation could take place first between sir john himself and kalendorff .
they more or less taught me to stand up on my skates , and i loved it .
she introduced dr gerard , who had just come out of the hotel .
perhaps thats just expression , dear .
why dont we , giles ?
he leaned over tommy , his face purple with excitement .
well , i can make a guess at it , captain hastings .
i shall have to speak as a medical man .
no , said grange .
very bad that .
and you found her always reliable and honest ?
sweetiman and edna resumed their argument .
his workand also mine .
she sagged against him , and he laid her down gently on the chaise longue .
he detested levity of any kind .
it must have been quite twenty minutes before poirot rejoined me .
you will answer me honestly , i know .
when its on the tip of your own tongue .
if so , i think we can say very definitely , that she herself is unaware of it .
of course , jean moncrieffe is a very nice girl , im sure .
when it seemed that she was not threatening him with it , he approached her , and gently took the gun from her .
i have an idea i was reading in bed with one the other day and it probably slipped down between the bed and the wall .
whats the matter with him , tuberculosis , something like that ?
i feel sometimes that he and his kind ought to be swept away , that they are blocking progressthat without them wed get things done !
she called after miss hinchcliffe : she wasnt there .
did it ?
so you know on a certain dateand perhaps quite an interesting datewho was here ?
searching for means of notifying her relations , miss lawsons name and address had been found and she had been communicated with by telephone .
i knew it would be there .
from there until tuesday night , when enderby ran across him , he refuses to account for his movements in any way .
quite cool and pleasant in the shadow of the marquee .
on the word of hercule poirot .
irish mail attacked by bandits .
satipy said again urgently : she fell from the path .
music lesson , she explained , laconically .
perrys husband ?
lansquenet had certainly been enthusiastic .
that man thinks he knows everything .
i had an advertisement to this effect inserted in a number of morning newspapers , and i was sitting in a small restaurant in soho , and judging of the effect of the advertisement , when a small paragraph in another part of the paper gave me a nasty shock .
and he did not see exactly how he was going to gratify his curiosity !
tell me all about it , darling etcetera , etcetera .
do you like this arctic one with the penguins and the ice ?
he said easily : ive no idea .
so you play les jeux denfants ?
then , suddenly recalling to herself the presence of others , she turned with a certain dignity : my son , messieurs .
he was listening carefully to the mockery in her voice .
i kept my eyes glued on that door .
some feature of interest about her house ?
i could come round this evening , if you like .
' ' i ' m sorry i can ' t help you , ' said jane politely .
they couldntactuallyhave seen anything at all .
but she has to play her partto go off leaving me alone with her victim .
i opened the window and she came in , not waiting for an invitation on my part .
fortunately at miss marples age , there was always some ailment that could be discussed with slight exaggerations on the patients part .
she looked back once and waved her handesther anderson was still standing on the doorstep , and she waved back cheerfully .
and i sat there in the carand hadnt the least idea !
yes , its got action , said tuppence .
she dozed off and the girl slipped out and in again .
mary jordan did not die naturally , quoted tuppence softly .
better and better , said mr .
then there was a great yell downstairs , and the squib went off , and everyone shouted fire .
the conversion .
extenuating circumstances !
the real martine shows up and turns out , most improbably , to be the wife of sir robert stoddart-west .
in fact the same old story , said tommy .
nonot really something you saw , shall we say , out of the corner of your eye hardly knowing you saw it .
why did he keep it ?
when i had finished , he nodded his head in approval .
iii miss vansittart and miss chadwick were in the common room when miss rowan entered and said : where is shaista ?
her husband was devoted to her but she came secretly to dislike him more and more .
obediently on the following monday (which happened to be bank holiday) , major wilbraham set out for eaglemont , friars lane .
at once , if you dont mind .
he asked the question , it seemed , more from politeness than because he had any desire for the information .
do you want your suspicions proved right or wrong ?
the dulcibella sisters are on at the palace in coventry .
miss brewis said acidly : lady stubbs doesnt often read the papers , sir george .
there was a long pause and then jane helier gave a great gasp .
hed have to be a scientist .
there was a good deal of defective wiring in stonygatesthe whole electric system was very old-fashioned .
is there anything i can do for you up at the house , miss elinor ?
but there was one thing that sir charles failed to realizethe efficient watchfulness of miss milray .
we went back to our hotel , where our diet was somewhat monotonous .
as she was going out of the room after having done everything required of her , emily arundell said unexpectedly : youre a good , faithful creature , minnie .
i know this pippemmerthis secret society of which sheshe flung a dramatic finger towards juliais an agent .
no , i agreethe thing becomes just conceivable instead of being ludicrously unreal .
foolish on my part , of course .
well , hed enjoy a chat about old times .
the village rushed to call , and mrs .
then , teasingly , she added , are you making immoral advances to me , jeremy ?
it didalmost .
he read the lettering on the grave .
carefully , he and the doctor lifted out chocolate after chocolate and examined them .
after that , the party broke up .
entwhistle looked at the italian primitive pointed out to him dubiously .
she seemed now principally concerned with the destruction of white butterflies so as to preserve cauliflower and cabbage plants .
her tone did not change .
and thats just where youre wrong , my girl , i said , because it wasnt the master at all .
good morning , major farrar , inspector thomas greeted him .
but there was no doubt who it wasit was my husband !
were so glad that your friend mrs .
i hear youve been falling about , he said as he finished his glass .
he gave a kind of shamefaced nod , but averted his face as he passed .
roddy had sent her flowersa great sheaf of long stemmed roses .
its been hung up againon a new cord .
what makes you think she told me ?
tom ?
you remember , it was a long time before i would consent to sit for her ?
you have been to the police .
it was absolute chance .
the instructions are very meagre , unfortunately .
hed have made a damned bad beggar , im sure .
he said abruptly .
of course , things have been difficult for him .
the page boy , alfred , was reading a crime story called death at eleven forty-five .
she must make allowances for an old man like myself , who comes to his decisions slowly .
a mans fundamentally honest , or he isnt .
i wanted john to be satisfied , i wanted john to have what he wanted .
wouldnt have believed such a thing could happen outside a novel , declared the colonel , for perhaps the twentieth time that night .
it seems to me so narrow-minded to condemn a thing that you have not even investigated .
he judged it wise to give the mews a wide berth .
is it really true that you came down hereby accident ?
i wouldnt mind doing the same thing .
noid no idea where you were .
especially as they dont read the lessons properly any more in churches .
thank goodness in the future lomax wont always be running over as he has been in the habit of doing , worrying me about things .
but his evidence was little short of sensational .
students rioting about something .
cried ipy .
entwhistle had placed at the inspectors disposal all the relevant facts about cora lansquenet .
douglas gold as miss lyall knew from her inspection of the hotel visitors book .
the distance was not actually so great , but the attraction of the depths below was overpowering .
rose , he is of the brotherhood .
im pretty sure it was january .
v a friendship had sprung up between clarice vane and young mrs laxton .
martha had been right .
and all in rather an unnatural way .
two and a half miles from here .
he added : you are intelligent , madame .
but poirot was looking at her facethe face of a woman of thirty-nine who had been famous since sixteen for her beauty .
that was ever so kind of you , mrs .
his habit of giving in to the gentry was lifelong .
thats probably princess whatshername herself , thought ann .
he said someone had left a note for me and was there any answer ?
he was in london , he explained , to see his doctor .
rather a remarkable personage .
i was thinking of them .
i once sounded her on the subject , and she said that she was obliged to support several of her husbands poor relations .
she went on : ive always thought i knew what was real and what wasnt this doesnt seem realbut it is so i may be wrong everywhere but who could want to do such a thing to me ?
i said mildly that though doubtless miss marple knew next to nothing of life with a capital l , she knew practically everything that went on in st .
it was born alive .
but frankly , i dont believe a word of it .
tell me instead of the girl called ednawho died in the telephone box in wilbraham crescent .
boscowan , when you went to see her .
they set up ladders and take window sashes out or pretend to be window cleanersoh , up to all kinds of tricks .
ones in the army .
she cannot help her lack of brains .
that was your only motive in going there , eh ?
and there was no one in the room ?
and she , the nurse , had got hold of the bottle and taken it away , and then come back to blackmail him .
not on herh ead miss marple stopped a moment to let her words sink in , and then went on .
that and the warning in it .
then she looked doubtful .
wellyes , laddie , that was the jolly old idea .
the girl performed a wave of introduction .
wells and john leaving the boudoir .
she seems to be worried about your other sister .
phillipa looked really surprised .
anyway , its on my conscience i never told him about layoneeor about that car .
yes , monsieur , i found it empty in the morning and threw it away .
that is to say it was roughly as i had intended it to be .
some people seem to have nothing better to do than write letters .
you meanhenrietta paused a momentbecause i loved john ?
mrs farley has identified it positively .
a barrister and his managing clerk duly gave advice and came to the rehearsals of the play on two occasions .
the nile and the pyramids and the sand .
i think he was told that it was a joke , said miss marple .
ive been sorry always for the class that cant beg , that must suffer in silencepoor gentlefolk .
time and place : .
not from my point of view .
and quite suddenlyjust as his eyelids were relaxing in sleepit came .
one of the women .
yesyes , i see it exactly you must give me a little timenot next weeklet us say the week after next .
the usual pause happened and then : i think mrs .
it gave one the impression of overhanging the sea .
as we sat down , our neighbors at the next table greeted us cheerfully .
you do not know evenor so i imaginewhat reason she had for the crime .
yes , i have been much occupied .
anyway , you dont want to let , he said .
dermot turned from her rather impatiently .
he believed i could take it .
for fourteen years she had had charge of mr .
they had been afraid from the start .
sothat will do nicely .
yes , he has a good dispositionbut he is too timidtoo yielding .
with a low flying tackle he brought the other to the ground .
what is your own theory , mr .
he has his troubles , that one .
argyle tells me that philip durrant has been killed .
and nearer and nearer came that indefinable sense of menace .
im afraid we cant go into that , the inspector replied .
steeped in the stuff , you know .
they seized ryland and the valet and disarmed them .
down to the terrace , sir ?
id swear , sometimes , that they know all about it .
i dont know why mr .
she gave a little shiver .
oh , no , nigel darling , its me .
i mustnt leave this room .
the most blessed thing about being an author is that you do it in private and in your own time .
she had been chambermaid at the crown for ten years .
hell have to try something else next .
how long is sir stanley digby staying ?
she could easily have misinterpreted a phrase , and twisted its meaning .
blair snubbed them .
there was a frown on his face .
he cried triumphantly .
it was an acquiescent smile , indulgent , but it held its reserve because , after all , he had heard it very often before .
we both played the comedy very prettily .
it concerns the prime minister .
argyle was very good to her .
mr farley glanced at that communication - one glance would have told him that it was the wrong letter - and yet he knew nothing .
miss carter duly giggled and said , go on with you !
i do , said poirot drily .
i passed through the symmingtons gate and up to the house .
it gives them the stimulation to carry on with their own private worries and anxieties .
cant expect old heads on young shoulders .
the car jerked and shot forwards .
asked the frenchman of bundle .
i hadnt got a straight grecian nose , or a rosebud mouth , or any of the things you ought to have .
its a possibility , he said .
but i cant get used to the idea of his being dead makes the house seem soempty .
hawess dressing gown .
gwenda vaughan went home just after seven .
the two bills addressed to dr rosen were a local one for seeds for the garden and one from a london stationery firm .
im sayingsupposing it has .
damn my head , said the young man .
she committed suicide .
the wasp is not so much interesting as suggestive , eh ?
to begin with one couldnt deny that she was , as ellie had said , very beautiful and also , as mr .
poirot looked thoughtfully in front of him .
wellhe shrugged his shoulderspresumably i was a damned fool .
now , to begin with , get the facts firmly into your head , because its all going to depend upon you .
she passed the red cow and the butchers and stopped for a brief moment to look into the window of mr .
he went on to detail the events of the morning .
they greeted him in a friendly fashion , but neither of them mentioned basil .
ohi see what you mean .
mademoiselle nick loved end house .
craddock spoke encouragingly .
but im keeping you talking here , miss .
youd probably know better than i would .
and he said , no , there wasnt a secret drawer that he knew ofbut he had got a secret passage in the house .
i suppose soyes .
there must be something wrong with it .
and colonel munro , looking slightly less fierce than usual , rather more worried .
the trouble with me is , m .
she glanced across at miss bennett .
i wonder if youd think it cheek if i asked you something ?
actually , we got on to him a little sooner than were admitting .
it faced the same way and had two windows , but it was much smaller .
a simple straightforward english girli may be old-fashioned , but i think the genuine article takes a lot of beating .
i will not have my cake called that !
i am afraidafraid the taxi drew up with a jerk at the quiet hotel where anne morisot was staying .
he seemed aware of my thoughts , for he opened his eyes and said quickly : there is nothing really wrong with me .
i suppose i oughtnt to bother her .
crackenthorpes conditional proposal of marriage .
a fact which you cannot possibly know since you were away yourself .
but i suppose it wasnt like malaya or those places .
an accident gives her thatthe young soldiers strange story .
first the girland the fact of her death takes off mr .
have no fears on that score .
always , always there is persecutionah !
it was on my way home .
how splendid !
michael argyle said slowly : wanted to see what sort of a chap you were his eyes ran appraisingly over calgary , noting the slightly stooped shoulders , the greying hair , the thin sensitive face .
defying the dead !
its good to be alive .
hallo , don , you had better have a look at tina , he said .
tuppence nodded , but she looked a trifle abstracted .
a morsel of omelette this morning descended on my waistcoat .
im glad to tell you the matter is now cleared up .
whilst not proposing to argue with him on the subject , i refused to accept the presence of the razor as proof positive of miss pettigrews sex .
whats she like now ?
you must have seen it when you looked at her .
if in a months time you are still in the same state of boredom , i will refund your money .
anne morisot had told you that she herself was going to england by trainyou never expected her to be on the planeand it seriously jeopardized your plans .
ferrier said gravely : everhard has abilitybut he is reckless , belligerent and utterly tactless .
she went to live , i believe , with a sister .
poirot hastily changed the subject .
pollock examined the latch of the window closely , uttering an ejaculation to himself as he did so .
she bent upon him an earnestness that was almost disconcerting .
can you wait for your traps till after lunch ?
i dont and no more do you .
youre wonderful !
it was nice of you to back me up .
hes always been a man of great originality of character .
i wonder now , said lady coote , where mr .
mary gerrard was running down the stairs .
perhaps (horror) edward would have forgotten all about her .
under the circumstances dwighton was not poisoned , was he ?
that girl told mr .
my hearts desire !
sixteen years ago .
you remember how i couldnt get through to hard and co .
i suppose it seems rather heartless to you .
i came across that up in yorkshire , far as i remember .
i didnt notice when she drank it .
sit down , m .
bouc , startled .
poirot , is this .
restarick did not answer for a moment or two .
easterbrook was at least thirty years younger than her husband .
ive rung up , but goodness knows when anybody will come nowadays .
i had already examined hensleys socks .
let her take that first .
said emily pausing in her facial repairs .
because the whole story of x was a fabrication , a smoke screen ?
he had no suspicionswhy should he have ?
but , darling , we took our tea to elbury only yesterday .
her sister , lady ravenscroft , was terribly upset .
i suppose you dont believe that .
it hasnt been found yet , remember .
he said : i congratulate you , m .
you belong to a club ?
' ' i don ' t know that i ' d say he was upset .
the weapon lay on the floora bronze figure about two feet high , the base of it stained and wet .
mary tapped on the sitting room door .
graham , that seems clear enough .
down to the last penny as usual .
but you , my dear , are a soldier .
so much life !
lantwickseventy-two years of age he is and hes the only man ive got i can really trust to cut for our best people .
christian would not commit suicide , and he was such a competent person that it could not possibly have been an accident .
you have no cliffs here , which is rather a pity from the point of view of likely theories .
no one knows .
he looked over his shoulder and raised one eyebrow quizzically .
what should they find ?
who exactly was staying in the house ?
ill keep an eye on the three witches .
i must thank you .
poirot uttered an exclamation of satisfaction as he perceived that the wooden door into the scullery was open .
all is well , boris ivanovitch .
it was very vague , but i thought i knew what he meant .
you look ill .
thats the point i was coming to , mr .
naturally , i could not stand hearing the girl i loved insulted , and i , too , lost my temper .
quite all right , thank you .
it ran somewhat to gables and turrets , had an air of being very newly painted and was surrounded with neat flower beds filled with scarlet geraniums .
good old boy , i said .
and the answer came immediately : by hand .
but all the same ive got to know who was in the house .
it was a lipstick in a gilt cardboard case .
she was the sort of woman who undertipped porters and cloakroom attendants .
wholl testify to that .
and shes not the only one whos unhappy .
they certainly didnt .
think of that solid middle-class english family , the oglanders .
he took me along the left wing of the house to a door at the end , and i realized that poirot had chosen for me the room i had occupied before .
one wouldntnaturally .
its a pity mr .
our advertisement looks well , he remarked , his head on one side .
true to my policy of apparent friendliness , i offered him a lift in our car , which he accepted .
in and out , in and out , with a precipice first one side of them , then the other .
i think you must know , madame , that people who are subnormal mentally are not always accountable for their actions .
tony was an admirable dog for a childhe was good-natured , affectionate , and lent himself to all my fancies .
i will tell you , m .
now , miss plenderleith , i should like to know all you can tell me about this business .
you couldnt look at the torchbecause the door was between you and it .
its no good wasting time on a patient that doesnt need my ministrations .
oh , come now .
you are in error , mademoiselle sarah , in what you say there .
and if one shot carried away the earring , and the second shot killed her , it cant have killed captain allenson as wellnot unless he was standing close in front of hervery closefacing her as it might be .
i think a hundred and twenty .
she wasnt depressed .
without any hesitation vera answered : dr .
bex took the fragment from him , and i came close to examine it .
and i dare say youll stick to it .
well , i felt rather the same now .
let race have it .
i caught it .
it wasnt really subversive activities i was thinking about .
your son had wealth , his ancestral home , and though his wife was subnormal she was a beautiful and docile girl , and you hoped he would be kind to her and that she would be happy .
at last the day came when mrs .
ill do my best .
i decided to take the war into the enemys country .
it was lapis she wanted , not carnelian .
he knew that he didnt .
if you work there , you know , you get terribly bored with films .
and how is it possible to make her speak ?
lacy and mr .
perhaps he missed the plane .
have you asked her to be my stepma yet ?
two elderly women living together , pensioned .
holyhead ?
i came to ask you for news , my good japp .
his wife says he came back before you heard the shot from outside .
but towards the end of the report , wetheralls large finger indicated the final paragraph .
i must be going mad .
she smiled at midge and went out again .
whats the motive ?
i like haydock as well as any man i know .
shes the only person whos got the ghost of a motive .
medicines , ointments , jars and jars of lotions to be filled , replenished and turned out every day .
it is not of the money i am thinking , simone , though you must realize that the money this woman has offered you for the last sitting is enormoussimply enormous .
surely she was cut off here from many friends and distractions .
i had met someone else , someone with whom i was quite infatuated .
he explained the position , to which race listened attentively .
you see , her voice deepened , i enjoyed the killingthat disagreeable woman , lydia hortonshed patronized meonce she referred to me as an old maid .
dont you say nothing against mum .
and so she came back and gave him poppy juice to close his eyes for ever .
but dont go and be stupid .
love isnt a drug that you take to blind you to your surroundingsyou can make it that , yes , but its a pitylove can be a lot more than that .
shed probably have to go to that little place in wardour street .
or may have observed some oddity of behaviour on her part .
poirot stooped to pick it up and twirled it round absentmindedly on his finger .
there the gentlemen , in their scanty triangles , could disport themselves as much as they pleased , with no female eye able to observe them from any point whatever .
allertons eyes rested upon tim and rosalie , standing side by side in the sunlight , and she said suddenly and passionately : but thank god , there is happiness in the world .
cried lawrence angrily .
well , heather badcock was a bit like that .
well go to east africa for our honeymoon and hunt out the cache .
said nevile with a shudder .
he just looked at me and said , youre nothing but a fool .
hugo snapped his fingers .
phew , he said .
she was childish enough still to have little sense of proportion .
prince oranoff came out into the moonlight .
never does it tranquil - no , not for a lit-de minute .
i dont get up , said lord altamount .
yes , a humber hawk .
the word publicity occurred throughout his conversation with the regularity of a leitmotif .
we went hopefully to the door and looked in .
twenty-one description of a murderer it was at this moment , i think , that what poirot called the human element began to fade out of the picture again .
it was only because .
' ' figure to yourself , ' said poirot .
what did she think about her own illness ?
then he realized that maudes conversation was being overheard .
i saw them at lunch .
after one brief perusal she laid it down and stared very straight in front of her .
he apologized , and she accepted his apologies with a smiling reassurance and passed on , leaving with him a pleasant impression of a soothing personality and rather fine grey eyes .
protheroe has had enough .
' ' they have it , yes .
she coughed suddenlya wheezing cough .
you realize that ?
scientific gentleman , he was .
it was late afternoon when i saw him next .
are you referring , said audrey with faint amusement , to my beautiful soul ?
the vast woman ate , ate greedily , hungrily , enjoying her food .
as i was saying , he remarked , im always afraid of getting hurt .
she murmured , fixing a limpid gaze on him .
not that i knew , anyway .
shes upstairs in her room , dressmaking .
and like a flash there came into her mind another memory .
eh bien , madame , there is a type of crime like that , a crime committed on the spur of the momentan inspirationa flash of geniuswithout time to pause or think .
he was staying down here last week for a night .
he glanced questioningly at the chief constable , received a nod , and went on : thatll do for you , my lad .
i was in church at the time and singing a verse of a psalm .
do you know why ?
the one i had last year , or perhaps the one before that again .
i went up in the lift to the fourth floor and walked along the corridor to no .
then i had a quick bathe and went up to the hotel again .
hope theyll do him well at that place , muttered the chauffeur .
but i say that a man who has got something on his mind will order automatically the dish he has ordered most often before .
john rang the bell , and ordered round the car .
poirots answer was not too reassuring : not precisely today , he replied .
to come and tell a family of people that a member of it who was condemned for murder and died in prison was really innocent .
it was typed on his office stationery and signed with his namethough as he pointed out to me , the handwriting was not his .
it would have enabled us to get through a lot more work in a limited time .
this is a confidential inquiry .
she looked after her fathera clever manbut terribly exacting .
will you sit down , mrs .
allen drew out the sum of two hundred pounds in cash from her bank .
but all the samewell , i mean , he did go there and kick up a fuss and threaten her and all that .
and if memory serves poirot (and it does !
he told me thingsthat he had been a very wicked man , and all the things he did in south africa .
james bentley looked distressed .
a tragedy she has never forgotten , that she has not allowed herself to forget and which ate into her as a kind of deep sore , an obsession .
she had seen anne protheroe , having arrived just after the inspector had broken the news to her .
you must have something better than that , said marina .
you sound as though you never liked it much yourself .
i cannot oblige you .
the chief constable kept sternly to the matter in hand .
well , sir , said japp condescendingly , you shall be in it too .
' _num_ four and twenty blackbirds hercule poirot was dining with his friend , henry bonnington at the gallant endeavour in the king ' s road , chelsea .
miss hartnells house was still there , and also miss hartnell , fighting progress to the last gasp .
very terrible , is it not ?
they went into the dining room where tea was set out and met with general satisfaction .
her mother was my friend .
then yahmose joined hori and imhotep , apologizing for his delay , and the three men went up to the tomb together .
and there are three big festivals in the year , the coming of the pasture , the full pasture , and the reaping of the pasture .
think of the points she made one after another .
i was so lost in my own thoughts that i never saw colonel race ride up and dismount from his horse .
the fact that murder had taken place at the vicarage seemed to afford him acute satisfaction .
her brains were the best of the family and we gladly fell in with her wish for a university education .
plane flew into the mountain .
he noted the pack slung on a chair .
hester rushing out to her car with no money in her purse , getting two pounds from kirsten lindstrom .
it was part of the whole thingnot just an end to a romantic novel or a fairy story .
she wore a close-fitting , high-necked gown of dull black that showed up the beauty of her body and the magnolia-whiteness of her skin .
then my cousin roley vavasour has been here a good deal .
to me , nowadays , anything young is beautiful .
wholl weep for rex in this house ?
i was doing the christmas rose bed very often , you know , and the pampas grass , and id see her going down .
is anyone there ?
if you will meet me this letter broke off in a different wayafter the me the pen had tailed off in a scrawl , and the last five words were all blurred and blotchy .
no other car was following us .
the girl looked very white and upset , and declared that she had seen a ghosta tall figure dressed all in white that moved without a sound .
shes had a university education and i daresay could have made a career for herself if she hadnt married .
the essence of respectability .
but ill give you the answer all the same .
i met richard .
it may mean you havent got the courage to stick up for yourself .
at night she would walk up and down her room , muttering to herself , and not allowing the people on either side of her to sleep .
as they struggled , the gun suddenly went off again .
oh , theres a blind woman there .
he is also a bit of an egomaniac and he resented his brothers success and superior character .
of course i thought it was a stroke .
that handicaps him to start with .
i couldnt help it .
very possibly , said the assistant commissioner .
in it she said that she was leaving mefor good .
she said in a most unaccustomed voice , firm and almost dictatorial , and weve got to stop it .
well , there it is .
the idea of suicide seems impossible .
ill ill just have a word with adeline , decided colonel clapperton .
the road was still wide but was now corrugated with ruts .
he was walking beside her with a set stiff face .
take my advice , pagett , and let your black eye be a warning to you , dont go on the bust again .
i didnt sell anything .
he turned up a few months ago when news of the royalist reaction got about .
round here theres a very nice verandah place , i think .
if id cared enough about anybody to make a fussbut i never got far enough .
rosaleens voice was stricken as she said : four thousand .
barton told me he was having this party to commemorate iris death .
youd better have some .
she wore a dark-brown knitted hat pulled down over one eye and ear .
hear weve got the duchess of alwiyah on this run , said the other .
arent they cunning ?
oh dear , it seems as though you cant believe in any one !
even on his last visit it had seemed natural to lady mary to speak to him of her preoccupation with her daughters future .
thomas royde broke in .
naturally it was a little difficult for me to decide what it was best for me to do .
i know how , each time , the impulse to kill becomes stronger , till , at last , for a trivial cause he broke off .
dont you see , he impersonated savage ?
the children were beginning to come out of the snapdragon room .
i daresay you mean your advice kindly , caterham , though i must confess that you put it somewhat strangely .
they went along the corridor which led to simeon lees room .
this was a man on whom the outer world did not impinge and who was contented that this should be so .
that did seem queer .
her troubles have made her so bitter and peculiar , poor dear !
her husband , said dermot thoughtfully .
this is rather a gloomy place for a young woman .
i mean , mrs bantry said they were yellow and pink .
that will be veronica .
you had a business in london , didnt you ?
it was a sales talk they were giving you .
as a result , of course , they inclined not to believe the tall stories she told .
when the devil did that train go out ?
rowley paused .
i tell you never has a man tired of me .
im perfectly all right .
plenty of ways open .
you were wise not to touch that stuffdont ever start , darling .
mind what you are doing , you damned idiot !
i always thought you were scottish ?
elliot .
they liked themselves and liked each other and day succeeded day in a quiet but enjoyable fashion .
the conversation now was on the subject of a much talked of case which had finished that day at the old bailey .
its justhow shall i put it ?
necks were craned forward .
he was quite content to wait and let her take her own time .
sergeant trotter cleared his throat .
then he said : it is my wife you have come to see , i know .
superintendent hale paused , drew a deep breath and passed , as it were , to chapter two .
im coming , jane .
he is simple .
maurs story .
ambition covers it better .
most of the people down here are nice enoughbut definitely on the dull side .
just what we want .
hautet and the commissary came down the steps .
then i will ask you to go into your room and put it on and then come out to us here .
a little flutter on the stock exchange .
that damned hens still broody .
why , no , i was here in nineteen twenty-three .
he said to sergeant hay : wheres that old lady ?
' a good many of my clients are women , ' he said .
they must control and rule .
she did not call herself by that name in those days .
they have sunk all their capital in it .
hes in a queer way .
why do you think the grey woman told you all she did tell you ?
after that she married ridgway becker , the american yacht owner .
though since he is cross-eyed i am not always sure when he does look my way he had a glass eye , said miss marple in an explanatory voice .
i hardly liked the inference .
the new facts that had come to her through janets early tea chat .
theyd take a very poor view of it if you did .
mademoiselle megan , all along , was haunted by a fear that it was you who had committed the second crime .
youre in it , whether i like it or not .
you must return with me to my house immediately .
she was desperate like .
well , i wanted to talk about wigs and about something that happened a great many years ago and probably you maynt remember anything about it .
she came to see the house and he took her over it .
not at all , said george .
he employed that power deliberately .
oh it was no trouble , indeed .
and you were satisfied with her whilst she was with you ?
he couldnt assert himself if he tried !
but id say he was honest according to his lights .
at the same time he thought it quite likely that the conclusion to which she had jumped was a just one .
his success brought him notoriety , and he decided to devote himself to the solving of problems in crime .
redfern , i do not like to descend perpendicular ladders .
im afraidit looks very much like foul play .
he is meeting me , but does not yet know that i have been consulting you on his behalf .
no good saying people didnt do such things .
mary .
however , as you say , the police at any rate will be satisfied .
it could be done .
i looked out on the lawn below .
they made over what means they had to her , and were guaranteed a comfortable old age until death camebut death did not delay very long .
peters _num_ : _num_ .
i assured her that i could support the expense .
it had come out with almost explosive force .
yes , yes , said poirot gently .
moira joined them .
in a minute .
what could be easier for her than to pick up one of parkers gloves from the hall that day and thrust it into the safe ?
i thought perhaps it might be important paperssomething of the kind .
poirot pushed on relentlessly .
the sitting room door flew open and george challenger barged in .
it would have been dreadful if there had been , wouldnt there , with his turning out a murderer ?

the ladies retired to bed early about ten oclock ; so did mr leonard weardale .
a regular little roly-poly , trying to stand up and falling overjust like an egg ; thats how that ridiculous nickname started .
hes probably looking for me , said bundle , without enthusiasm .
i do not reply , amongst other faded middle-aged faces .
it was only that he thoughtjust for a moment yes , miss morley ?
poirot continued : i have today come from market basing and while there i have talked to miss lawson .
mother was very fine and dignified about it all .
i appreciate that in this matter , any unnecessary expense was incurred in order to please me .
suggestive words ?
poirots voice was very gentle and persuasive .
well , ive always felt it might be one some day .
he turned his head to look at her .
she didnt turn up this morning , explained the young man .
he was told that someone was demanding him in the bar .
but hed always been a good son to his mother , and he never failed to let her know when he was in trouble which showed , didnt it , that he trusted her ?
she did not analyse the feeling at the moment , but later , when windlesham had left her , she tried to probe the recesses of her mind .
im sure i dont know quite how , but she said that friends of yours had once found you very helpful in in a case something like ours .
if you did hear of anything .
weston said : marshalls out of the picture .
the wound here was in the breast and the bullet was lodged in the body .
never cry about things until you are sure .
when the room was wanted for the new lady coming in .
inform them of what has happened .
your only difficulty was keeping up separate relations with the two women , and even that was not so difficult as it looked .
howell was the housekeeper , that dignified , creaking lady who struck terror to the heart of lady coote .
let me introduce you to mrs .
a lot depends on being on the spot first thing , and thats where mr .
i wondered what you were up to , said david .
and where does this girl whose name might just possibly be norma live in london ?
a fountain ?
how well did you know the second mrs .
something of the kind , admitted anthony .
i should say she didnt even recognize him .
cant see what she saw in him .
and if its not me , they think its laurence , she went on .
i recognized the old mother as we arrived here .
she snarled .
it was the man who had passed me on the road when my shoe came untied , and in a flash i knew why his face was familiar .
he had a job in a stationers .
no , i dont think i am .
chapman be deadand let it be mabelle sainsbury seale for whom the police look .
during the war i often noticed a barber in london knew more than the high command .
he was so deep in his own thoughts that he started perceptibly when someone came in and sat down opposite him .
these cases where the police of two counties had to collaborate were always difficult .
ill be coming to rutherford hall presently to have a word with cedric , but i want to get hold of dr .
i had got off at the worlds end , i think it was , and naturally i thought he had stayed with the othersor gone the other way .
but all the time there was that strange urgent appeal in her glance .
you dont seem convinced .
she turned obediently .
i beg your pardon , my friendone can always be mistaken .
why , he left me a hundred pounds .
the last of my sons .
but it was definitely attached to a bodya small skinny body .
he was just being chatty , said mrs .
now , mrs hailsham-brown , the inspector began .
i cannot expect you to believe me on my bare word .
she forgot .
then lost consciousness again .
havent i already done so ?
crosbie ?
but in the note i asked bunch to show you , miss blacklock had written inquiries with an i .
" that ' s all there is to it .
so there it isno one knows .
its good , i tell you .
he let em off and everybody around about was busy watching them .
haymesworks at dayas hall .
three hours later they were at croydon .
no more to it than that ?
oh , no doctor , i protested .
i have just heard from dr .
i am really sorry .
all that play of affection and gratitude was so much poppycock .
you see , that does not help at all .
im more sorry about this than i can say .
he declared it was only a scratch .
he had a torch in his pocket .
the ring was returned in a plate of soup .
herzoslovakia is a small country , but it could not be left out .
never anything out of the ordinary .
unfortunately brewster , who looks after old mr .
qu-quite right .
all later events seem to have been wiped out .
if id thought linnet would have looked afraidbut shes got plenty of physical courage .
brussels , he announced with enthusiasm .
its so near .
boxes of dates , preserved fruits , figs , french plums , cherries , angelica , packets of raisins and currants , pounds of butter and sacks of sugar , tea and flour .
a gleam of light passed over the boys face .
as it happened , we had , and mrs .
i had my glasses out , and thats how i happened to see miss cram (if it was miss cram , and i think so) , join them .
people who try to write in an uneducated manner usually give themselves away .
he was breakfasting with inspector james leach , his nephew , when the telephone rang .
but youll get used to themoh yes , youll get used to them in time .
roddy shook his head helplessly .
tuppence wandered up an aisle looking at memorial tablets on the walls .
no , we parted at the door .
presently she opened them again and blinked once more .
no , to keep the girls from getting at the soldiers !
its ready , said rowley .
you do not think that is too much of a coincidence ?
its none of my business , i said .
inspector jameson answered this .
battersea park .
she was trembling slightly .
well , said bobby with a sigh .
he wouldnt listen to her he was very difficult sometimes .
i told him that id have to think about it and id have to consult my wife .
ive got to go on .
the rest , you know .
come into this place and have a good cup of strong coffee .
i had known him in his college days , and though i had lost sight of him for some years , the old ties of friendship still held , and i accepted with pleasure his invitation to go down to silent grove , as his new purchase was called .
dont say i dont do my stuff , aunt jane , he murmured under his breath .
moreover , her hands are far too small and delicate .
miss marple tells her story _num_ .
well , i said , summing up the situation , you will keep an eye on sir eustace and colonel race i know why ive got to watch sir eustace , interrupted suzanne , because of his figure and his humorous conversation .
i said : look here , old boy , you must take a hold on yourself .
so i came at last to collecting brains .
another person unknown would be merely another j .
i rose at once .
oliver had a cashmere pullover for warmth and a thin pullover for hot days , either of which was suitable in colour to go with this .
there is a horrid side of one that enjoys accidents and public calamities and unpleasant things that happen to one ' s friends .
there was nothing , monsieur .
no interruptions and all the apparatus you want .
mary looked sideways at her master and as though receiving inspiration from his slow nod , plunged on again .
its breath was like a perfumed caress .
its better to be sick .
cavendish , i much fear there is no coincidence there .
morleys voice still held a reverent tone as he stood over poirot ramming the filling home .
i looked forward to extracting some interesting details from japp .
she did not snap at basil west , her husbands private secretary , because nobody ever snapped at basil .
we could find out , doubtless , if mr .
diagnosis included brain tumour , encephalitis , and lobar pneumonia .
that appleton case , i remember it very well now .
what a nice string bag .
have you seen kelvin , the landlord of the three anchors ?
, said the nurse .
with a sudden exclamation , tommy stooped down and pulled something from under the sofa .
i didnt want you to know it wasjohn .
a strange masklike expression came over the girls face .
peel edgerton ?
he had agreed easily enough .
i have a question for you .
the girl had no grudge against the elder renauld , no possible motive for wishing his death .
wood always pays for things in cash .
looking dumbfounded , hastings joined him there .
andand soi bolted .
prying and snooping and lying and making trouble .
in the busheswhite .
she was on no account to be disturbed until the following day .
if i marry a woman , i pay for the licence .
the mistress , she nursed him very devoted , but he died .
no , im not lady macbeth .
theyre nothing of the sort .
we both hesitated a moment , and then i said : i hope you like our little church .
but he left just before dinner .
miller whistled .

i regained control of myself and spoke in my normal voice : we seem to have said all there is to be saidexcept good night .

wont you go on ?
poirot ran rapidly through the sheets .
it seemed almost as though jeremy cloade was unwilling to bank upon any improvement in his prospects .
made his money in south africa originally .
still , you know , he is superstitious , the old man .
you dont mean to say , said bill eversleigh , that gerry wades not up yet ?
youre unbelievable .
she continues , that , i thought , would make rather a good beginning to a storya name overheard at a teashopan unusual name , so that whoever heard it remembered it .
they were both essentially cautious .
lombard said briskly : have something to eat .
) i thought her very lovely .
hercule poirot to come to scotland yard at _num_ : _num_ ?
yes , i think thats how it happened .
whats the difference ?
there were some letters on the hall table ready to be posted , sir .
quite a lot of expensive gadgets .
the same actions will be performed as on the former occasionbut they will not necessarily be performed by the same people .
these are big blocks .
and then he talked a lot about lucrezia borgia .
that is official , you see .
bobby shuddered and brought his eyes up again to the face .
for one thing was certain , that curious sense of strain and constraint was not imagined .
his pristine freshness was somewhat impaired .
theyre scurrilousabsolutely scurrilous !
miss marple asked who mrs .
she could not , however , force herself to buy anything very thin !
do you think that is a good thing or a bad thing ?
well have to make a list .
crooked , yesbut not a crook .
but i fancy we understand your little game !
with the exception of the victim .
mother , meanwhile , prepared a self-contained suite of three rooms and a new bathroom .
and they say the doctor wont allow any visitors .
a little word in your ear .
but perhaps you no longer care tothe affair of the money blunt gave a sound like an angry laugh .
there we were , going on a journey with itand our wedding journey too .
mayor regretfully out .
satterthwaite , it is not as the doctors think .
put a slug or something down amyass back one day when he was hard at work painting .
can we make a guess at miss bowers ?
in addition , mrs .
but after he married belinda he never so much as looked at another woman .
i was a queer patriotic , enthusiastic girl , nurse , full of idealism .
wax ?
ah , he said .
philip paused , and then shot out a question : what does she know about this business that she isnt telling ?
had pilots waiting there .
she rose , inspector slack pushed open the window for her , and she stepped out on the terrace and round the house to the left .
she had conqueredhad triumphed over the most deadly peril .
anyway , she pulled through .
at all costs he must silence her .
he ought to be making an idiot of himself over one girl after another .
youve met him twice , said henrietta dryly .
glorious east indeed !
im out for a walk .
he had one of your suitcases open and was looking through your papers .
magdalen and charlotte came together out of the house , and strolled arm in arm to a rustic seat some little distance away .
but down below there was no trace of a boots or anyone else .
hilary smiled up at andy peters .
i am not a fool , said miss lindstrom sharply .
when does m .
oh , hurry !
i fancy he breathed a sigh of relief when she complied .
they are what i call the respectable killers .
blunt would get rid of her with a subscription .
ive an idea ive heard that somewhere .
we must have a look at her face sooner or later .
' _num_ problem at sea " lonel clappertonl ' said general forbes .
old , swollen , bloated , sitting there immovable in the midst of thema distorted old buddhaa gross spider in the centre of a web !
the nurse was standing there to let her out .
theyll know something about the place , and whether theres been anyone there lately .
they bowed to the monstrosity on the presiding throne and took their places .
he proposed to take a small cottage in the country where he could live quietly and go on with his work .
he did not like the hoover , and he objected to tuppence having a lengthy conversation with beatrice .
leopard darling , you cant mean it .
and weve the evidence of the chemist at the corner of the road .
poirot , his head a little on one side , was regarding him with close attention .
ill do my best , poirot , i assured him .
if , for one generation , only the intelligent were allowed to breed , think what the result would be .
a book called our white violet was a great favourite of mine .
exclusive news for the daily wire .
there is absolutely no question of dalliance .

had a young wifeand a babylittle girl .
he snatched my suitcase .

we carried it out that evening .
mens nerves are not strong eough to endure this , but women can achieve the fortitude necessary .
miss chadwick always finds the french mistresses sly .
well , never mind , george dear .
she said , obstinately : tom must come too .
' ' no , no , mademoiselle , you don ' t appreciate the point i ' m trying to make .
i reproved him .
the second was that , though he seemed to know all about my working at leahampton , he assumed that tommy was in scotland .
ishasyour maid agnes come in ?
i am fond of you , henry , i told him , but i cant live without jeremy .
the girl sprang to her feet .
wetherby opened her eyes .
tommy frowned in an effort at remembrance .
i think , on the whole , shes the most likely person .
well , he added with a sigh , sorry to hear about ada .
he said , with a curious ring in his voice .
jefferson , sir , wasnt quite a fool .
but someones got to help me .
colonel johnson said : that seems conclusive .
it is what she called them , said poirot .
she didnt look as anxious as she used to look .
they cross them overhead to make a passageway , and charlotte , steadying herself , passed along that passageway , released by her attendants and making her progress solo to a vast carved chair with gold fittings and upholstered in golden brocade at the head of the long table .
he handed it to lady marroway , who took it , exclaimed at its beauty and passed it to mr .
she was shotshot at close quarters .
is there any queer mental strain in thema kink of any kind ?
naturally one feels that that someone must have been you .
he left it at that , and hilary realized that what he had left unsaid was , but all the same , we had better be careful .
but really , henry , i have never seen why .
bleibner left a will ?
the sort of thing they say , you know , to the bellissima signorina .
then , instead , i rang you up at the club and asked you to come back here immediately , all three of you .
then he said : if youve finished , shall we set off for hunterbury ?
the two occupational therapists , mr .
if amyass fingerprints are the only ones found .
oh , you did , did you ?
im glad to know definitely .
raynor took a letter from his pocket .
your lawyers will be useless .
pat turned on him angrily .
this is very kind of you , im sure , m .
and this statement appropriately opens the novel that is regarded as agatha christies most singularly challenging mysteryit is , in fact , hercule poirots own favourite case .
but you do know howhow sorry i am .
all the same , hes the dark horse .
did he have any idea of who slowly dr .
marshall this morning ?
no , she wasnt , said jeremy .
not that nurse hopkins was as bad as that red-haired irish nurse .
i said i supposed one had to go by sea .
i wouldnt say that , dear , said miss marple , not crystal clear , and murder , dear raymond , isnt a game .
in a way , i think , his happiest time , where monty was concerned , was after the south african war .
hercule poirot stared at him .
the dance had stopped .
she got up from the bed .
wasnt it madness to keep them ?
he said he knew a murderer , said miss marple .
reliable ?
yes , he said , it is .
hence the melancholy ?
goldie about the cromartie merger , you lunched with lord forthville at the berkeley ah , it was that day , yes .
a flash of interest lit up sir edwards face .
gaythorne rose .
that ought to have satisfied me .
she was a very pretty girl , emily noticed , smartly and expensively dressed , and she also thought that she had never seen a girl in a greater state of nervous apprehension .
i should imagine lying down in her cabin .
professor wanstead was watching her .
molly davis stepped back into the road and looked up at the newly painted board by the gate .
but i should think twice about it if i were you .
her tongue was sharp but her actions were kind .
try the safe , suggested tuppence .
will you now tell me , please , at what hour you last saw m .
never heard of a haunted flat , declared parker decisively .
weve all got hipsalthough we poor women are trying awfully hard to pretend we havent .
also there was a slight mist rising from the sea .
i cant use it .
poirot said gently : in fact , you may have been quite alone in the drawing room ?
mother will be glad when fathers dead and she can marry dr .
shes at the tio hotel , i believe .
' lord mayfield said slowly : ' oh , well , have it your own way , but i don ' t see what the fellow can do .
she said irritably , oh , dont be stupid , rowley .
emily gave him her hand and squeezed his warmly .
all the top layer had been tampered with , the underneath ones were all right .
judith , i said sharply .
japp looked momentarily put out .
ruth kettering looked down at the ground for some moments , then she said , without raising her head : supposing he doesnt consent ?
oh , yes , miss marpleanything i can do for you ?
it was a piece of silk , and the embroidery was unmistakable .
the official dragoman took charge and the party was led ashore to visit abu simbel .
outside tom hartigan had rejoined lily marbury who was waiting for him on the embankment .
you see , shes left her husband .
fane was here this afternoon , asking for you .
got over there by eight oclock .
but anyway , for this young man , she has a magic that he cannot resist .
dont lets talk any more about me , said evelyn .
ii was quite dumbfounded .
evelyn said hesitantlyshe seems to have had blackouts , from what she told me , and to be frightened of people .
and , on reflection , she was quite certain that mr .
master , said boris , bowing .
tommy had a feeling he was probably foreign .
but how much do you know about the power of suggestion ?
he had gone to egypt in the hopes of improving his health , but had returned , so his letter told me , rather worse than better .
usually , of course , these were of a wholly private or domestic nature , of little interest to anybody but herself .
ronald , she said .
if iif i believed that i could have earned enough to keep jan and myselfbut i dont know that i could .
that world would have suited them ; theyd have been at home in it .
she is , perhaps , nothing at all .
charlotte managed montyand he was very fond of her too .
norton , of course , knew exactly how the wind lay .
he snorted angrily .
i do not permit myself to fail .
_num_ in a heap on the floor , lying as she had fallen from one of the chromium chairs , was the body of a young woman of perhaps twenty-seven .
not me ?
an interesting story , m .
and as he spoke , his eyes , gimlet-like , bored into her face , seeking to read her mind , noting every indication of her manner .
it was all there in enquire within upon everything .
by you ?
i mean , im sorry to say things about my sister , but its quite true .
and then we walked a little way along the corridor looking at some of the pictures and the curtains .
it had simply not been taken out with the other cards .
got my own parking place here , she remarked .
dakins .
rosenkraun .
she looked at him very earnestly , and when he replied courteously in the affirmative he noticed something very like a flicker of disappointment pass over her face .
i exclaimed , is he still here ?
you saw us together yesterday .
tommy lay silent .
we all of us get stale as the years go by .
i wouldnt enjoy it if i did that .
in this case , said poirot , it meant a funeral .
satterthwaites friends , his ideas even less so .
ive got an old box of them from last winter .
miss howard , in particular , took no pains to conceal her feelings .
he surged and eddied into speech .
she said : they have arrested carl !
id thought of taking her for a walk up to legge tor .
yes , oh yes .
the number of people ive converted .
you saw it too , said joanna .
and then , standing a little way from her , he quotes those words from the duchess of malfi just as the child upstairs has reached the banisters and is peering down .
but philip he made an impatient gesture .
when she spoke her voice was harsh and brittle .
but its got to be gone into all the same .
she had quite enjoyed herself , talked to some nice people .
of course , the gentleman is a doctor .
inglethorp turned to give some instructions about letters to evelyn howard , and her husband addressed me in his painstaking voice : is soldiering your regular profession , mr .
well , perhaps i will let you have it this time .
not unless it should become necessary , and that would only happen if some circumstances out of the past proved to have been connected with this murder at _num_ , wilbraham crescent .
all life is dangerous .
something , surely very old .
darling , the way ive seen her look at brenda !
film star robert truscott .
roddy shook his head vigorously .
blunt had shown several signs of restlessness whilst poirot was speaking , but the closing words seemed to rivet his attention .
what were you doing walking along pond street on such a foggy evening ?
sir oswald took her hand in an iron grip and she winced slightly .
of course i should have seen it .
unkerton had been as good as her word , and had a new pane of glass put in .
anyway , i mean , she says she wont she doesnt even want him to know where she is .
whats this roomthe billiard room ?
but at that moment , the moment when battle apparently admitted anthonys complete absence of complicity in the crime , anthony felt more than ever the need of being upon his guard .
lombard said softly , patting the revolver in his pocket : im going to take very good care he doesnt .
very unfair .
she said gently : dont mind so much for me , monsieur poirot .
the bentley swerved dangerously .
the surgeon is about to operate .
he edged nearer to smugglers rest and passed through the open gate .
im going to stodders place tomorrow for the last few days of the holidays .
she thought deeply , wondering how best to attack this new phase of the matter .
there are no short cuts .
taped with adhesive tape .
well , he was in charge of the situation now .
permit me to introduce a friend , mr .
donovan is taken in .
and calculation .
' she reflected for a minute or two .
its called rutherford hall .
its happened before .
if she shrieked for help there was very little chance of anyone hearing her , whereas there was probably quite a good chance of mrs .
very elaborate , said tuppence .
receiving an affirmative answer , she said that miss marple would find her waiting at the top of the stairs .
he selects them haphazardthats my opinion .
indeed , i have had no news from her since she left meadowfield .
to begin with , you will remain here .
very cunning he was at hiding his money from me .
i am always pleased to help any fellow actress , and shall be at home if you will call this evening at nine oclock .
i had some milk and bread and butter in the kitchenand then suddenly rose came in looking queer and she said that agness outdoor things were still in her room .
said sylvia .
not always inartistic , said mr .
youve got to realize that .
chief-inspector taverner has arrested brenda and laurence .
morris oxford , black saloon , number cmg _num_ , reported by a probation officer .
finally the woman opened her eyes feebly .
she said with an affectation of eagerness : but i really am very keen on the olive branch , dr .
i did love my father .
the silver first , and fill the sink right up .
there was a vacant tenancy and i imagine that the lady who was leaving , being an acquaintance of hers , told her in advance that she was giving it up .
she was very devoted to them , mr .
she comes in daily .
i mean , shes made this place .
and a woman passed the other way , going towards it .
may i see it ?
oh , is that so ?
the words suggest some boon companion of his own .
everyone has something to hide , i quoted , smiling .
no woolworth handkerchiefs , reported race , rapidly replacing the contents of a drawer .
she may have hoped to get sums of money out of you for the child (hardly a child nowa boy presumably of fifteen or sixteen) without many questions being asked .
same old story .
but now , after the doctor had stumped away , the old lady lay with a frown on her face , thinkingthinkingresponding absentmindedly to minnie lawsons well-meant fussingand then suddenly coming back to consciousness and rending her with a vitriolic tongue .
and yet he is fair .
ill go now , i said .
jessop moved to the opposite side of the bed , standing back against the wall so that he was out of the womans range of vision .
how would you know about things like that ?
the self-appointed medical man sighed and went downstairs in search of lanscombe .
not only was her figure like a childs rubber ball , her face might also have been made of india rubber .
it came to me when i was looking at myself in the glass last night .
then we went down to supper .
i forced a yawn and an apologetic smile .
the labour leaders .
a man whose car had broken down near the house , i believeyes , ill tell him .
colonel melchett was an irascible-looking man with a habit of tugging at his short red moustache .
a little pebble had just struck the terrace beside us , and poirots fanciful analogy from it tickled my fancy .
im going to tell you .
blunt said gently : but you are not happy about it , eh ?
are you suggesting suicide ?
no heart at all , these fellows , nowadays .
poirot sent me away .
but where , oh where , was the countess ?
make it strong , james , he implored .
poirot said soothingly : precisely , mademoiselle .
she said : inspector grange is here .
to continue , i studied the dead body of this woman and i did not like what i saw .
he said : does one really think about relations ?
those are just the sort of things that are hell to remember .
that was adhered to , and during that period there were no letterswhich was probably just as well , because i should have fallen for those letters in the end .
you must forgive my altering the appointment .
what are all these people , by the way ?
and if you ask me , sir , what you are thinking is all wrong .
but of course mr .
no , we must find something better .
she made her attemptand failed .
impossible !
wimborne gave a crabbed little smile .
pull down the blind again , will you , hastings .
almost automatically , i picked it up and slipped it into my pocket .
well , this note for one thing .
it was written in one of those old-fashioned spidery handwritings , and it was , moreover , crossed on two pages .
so ive got to cram you .
she thought of him as rather a splendid being , tyrannical , often fussy , exhorting everybody right and left , and sometimes provoking her to quiet inward laughter , but nevertheless a personage .
until agreed poirot .
that still peaceful figure .
he cleared his throat and said in a would-be conversational tone : nice peaceful spot youve found for yourself , sir .
he turned to campbell .
he had sat behind her at the cinema , and the friend he was with had known her and had introduced them .
you deserve it , said mother .
leave the telephone number on my desk , said poirot .
well , that was flat .
one forgets things .
or it may not have been strychnine at all , but some obscure drug no one has ever heard of , which produces much the same symptoms .
of course there wasnt .
shes had no sympathy or understanding .
the old lady looked at her curiously .
the murderer didnt come from outsideso he must have come from inside .
and you found them , you say , in this tennis racquet ?
delicately , poirot cleared his throat .
i was thinking , of course , of the nursery rhyme .
he picked up a tube of seccotine , fingered it absently for a minute or two , then said : let us pass on .
but you , mademoiselle , you yourself , you have often seen how the awkward schoolgirl changes almost miraculously into the attractive and well-groomed dbutante .
to this house poirot betook himself and , there being no bell , executed a series of sharp flourishes with the knocker .
he was also to ask to see the letter .
you know , inspector , it makes me very , very angry .
it was a little girla babywas it not ?
she was the most glorious and the most lovely thing id ever seen .
not for sure .
i dislike your father , alfred .
blore said : yes , youre right .
she gave me some money and told me to get out and go to the ritz .
it is bad , that , and it will get worse .
but we are only at the beginning of the road .
it was dark and he only said a word or two and that i couldnt catch .
he couldnt have too much to live on .
and the eldest was well over sixty then .
she gave a faint inclination of her head to her left .
i turned my head sharply .
turning back suddenly to face her , he asked quickly , does richards death benefit you financially ?
but i did listen that daythe day that mr .
well , him i keep strictly to the point .
i didnt actually feel too bad .
im quite all right now .
it was widely rumoured in ramat that prince ali yusuf had given this valuable packet to bob rawlinson , his private pilot , and that bob rawlinson had arranged for its despatch to england .
on the wireless .
ii do remember hearing about it , i think , said molly rather breathlessly .
and now tell me more about these accidents .
i just thought it rather a gruesome idea .
we also wished to ask you a few questions .
i think i know the truththough there is one fact that baffles me utterly .
her mother had died when she was a baby and her father had married again .
youve got to make a big play for her .
ill make you sorry for this .
tea as a meal had rather gone out of fashion since the war .

and also to put right .
from salisbury .
he demanded , advancing into the room .
you remember rudolf ?

with some difficulty hercule poirot tool his leave without breaking off the conversation too abruptly .
thirteen i one of us one of us one of us .
what can we have the pleasure of doing for you ?
in practice our beliefs would work out much the same , things in common and ownership by all , but the differencewell , i neednt go into that .

there is a door leading into it farther along , but it was always locked at six o ' clock .

you dont think that i and my sergeant and police constable nye and nigel chapman were the victims of mass hallucination ?
lee was a well-known figure in these parts .
because of air raids .
thats all very nice and pleasant , im sure , said battle .
the days that he did not see the little lonely lady , as he called her to himself , were blank .
the barmaid at the dog and whistle , sally jones , she remembers him perfectly .
she didnt kill herself .
didnt you fake this clueand put it in the boiler room , for the boys to find ?
she had ridden down into this dark winding valley and here , like an archpriestess of some forgotten cult , like a monstrous swollen female buddha , sat mrs boynton chapter _num_ mrs boynton was here , at petra !
those two are on very intimate terms and that girl was all on the jump after the murder .
perhaps just as well , but she did not think that either janet , bert or clarence was likely to be a danger to her .
this was clearly the wanting son .

there is such a thing as undue influence .
so that was the game , he muttered .

venetia could take a sporting shot (or do you call it a sporting puff ?
that letter was written to jack renauldnot to his father .

the others answer was explosive , but the chief constable interrupted him .
very strict and proper and all that .
i cant , i cant .
something , surely , to do with soap .
said tony bitterly to the world at large .
we must all be very kind to her .
fortescue , sitting here in the library and having tea .
oliver was looking somewhat different from when poirot had last seen her , and the reason lay , as she had already hinted over the telephone , in the fact that she had once more experimented with her coiffure .
lavinia skinner was a tall , gaunt , bony female of fifty .
double roomnice view of seagiles will like that .
i think , if mr .
they say peel edgerton can smell a criminal !
and as a result mrs .
but , my dear , i do beg of you to guard your tongue and be careful of what you say .
leidner had had half a dozen affairs sheila would probably have approved of her as living her life fullyor obeying her blood instincts .
i am quite sure that parker did not do the murder , he added gravely .
a year ago i came into a legacyenough to enable me to realize a dream .
on either side of the big open porch were doors leading into the two principal rooms .
he said , with something as near irritation as he had yet shown : this is very irregular , mr .
twenty-two it was not very characteristic of hercule poirot to ask the opinions of others .
why didnt you tell me sooner , then we would have had time to make preparations .
she spoke , nodding her head slowly , and her voice was like a snowflake , cold and soft .
she said , harking back suddenly .
well , your aunt ada doesnt .
there was nothing wrong with their lives as far as one could tell .
im not so sure about that .
i just like a common-sense game , the inspector told her .
about a dozen people all trying to talk at once , including one of those mittel europas who go off at the deep end at the mere sight of a policeman .
la fleeting smile showed for a minute on the face of a small man sitting near them .
htel du phare .
i think theres something very sinister about them , said anthea .
i dont suppose they will , said colonel pikeaway .

the card bore the inscription : miss esme farquhar , and poirot , after diving under the table to retrieve a stray crumb , and putting it carefully in the wastepaper basket , nodded to the landlady to admit her .
poirot was hurrying along , and battle eyed him curiously .
she looked at him coolly but with such a blaze in her eyes that he drew back before it .
in consequence , engagement was broken off .
she was looking at john christow .
my dear judith , i exclaimed , taken aback by the positive fury of her tone .
now there are just one or two points i would like some information on , major burnaby , said the inspector , and i think you can probably tell me what i want to know .
how could i give her away to george ?
i need for it chocolate and much butter , and sugar and raisins .
said hester .
he wont find anybody there .
no , no , pray keep it until you get to the gate .
people dont always forgive it .
she is french .

he must have been dead now twelve years or more , thought mr .
he bent over and tested the knots .
wellperhaps aching a bit all over , you know the kind of thing temperature ?

who exactly is doctor nielson ?
or suicide ?
but the first thing , she added , is to get in touch with poppy .

and a person who is gay , jolly and pleased with herself .
this is your second good deed of the kind , is it not , mr .
owns valuable house propertycoalfieldsand in addition he staked out a claim to some mine in peru or somewhere in south america , when he was a young man , which has yielded him a fortune .
so it ties up with the mcginty murder .
raymonds dont fit either , doctor .
the light of a little electric lantern fell on the sleeping child the holder of it was still invisible in the shadow .
about the presentyes .
said greta .
if anyone is falsely accused not even that .
when really it was the greatest surprise to her she could hardly believe her ears when the lawyer read the will she told us so herself .
i never knew you were interested in that sort of thing , mark .
at least , she is my stepdaughter .
her eyes , grave , sad , childlike , questioned his .
whitechapelwhite heartsh , white headsn shorrow to the grave but mr .
poirot looked into the car .
and youll have no objection to saying so , careless like , at a suitable moment ?
monsieur poirot , i have come to consult you upon a matter of the most vital urgency .
now , now , mademoiselle .
he did not sound particularly thankful .
) very beautiful chinese cabinet .
and yetwhy should anthony marston commit suicide ?
hes been awfully kindhe really has .
as a matter of fact it wasnt quite a set speech because he varied it a little each time to suit the person he was talking to .
its really too bad .
she hadnt got the beauty of lily , but she seemed an attractive woman , pleasant and efficient .
suzanne looked at me searchingly .
serrocold and edgar lawson ?
is that so , do you know ?
she was away for two terms with some illness and then came back .
says theyre betting gains .
i wont forget , said lucy , and hurried out into the hall not quite certain as to whether she had or had not just received a conditional proposal of marriage .
oh , no , we dont know anyone !
some last minute outburst or accusation ?
it is , i think , a pity to begin with a catechism .
what about you , elaine ?
protheroe that evening in the studio at a quarter past six .
the dagger or the cup of poison ?
now , if we accept possibility one as the most likely to have occurred and the one supported by most evidence , we must also accept certain facts arising from it .
what would dr .
i began to ask myself certain questions .
got to do my duty , you know .
but you both impressed on me how important this work was .
at little paddocks .
you mean that one of our servants , or a slave no servant and no slave , imhotep .
or will it ?
a vague feeling of apprehension came over emily brewster .
grotesque though this made her appearance , no one was inclined to laugh .
theyd have been published at once .
i think im going to give up working in the canteen at the studios , said gladys .
invaluable at such times .
how do you do , major riddle ?
there was no answer and he rang again and then seized the knocker which he plied for some minutes vigorously .
something she ought to have done .
was that power ?
now then , agatha , which will you havethe fat young one with pimples , and the scurfy head , or that black one like a gorilla with the bulging eyes ?
hercule poirot said : justice is a very strange thing .
how maddening children are !
tell him youre not going to arrest him .
she had no mind to be parted from him , nor for that matter had he any intention of being parted from her .
poirot introduced him to katherine .
like an animal .
' the truth of the matter is , ' he explained , ' that your late 	mistress , mrs todd , was much concerned about you .
she read the book for a little then she laid it down beside her .
she went away from home and was not seen again .
incalculable ?
but with a spurt of laughter , victoria cast away the enveloping aba .
officially .
youve known him for a long time ?
looked as though he had a date somewhere .
but parker is the most likely .
superintendent sugden said stolidly : criminals usually make mistakes .
she mustnt be moved .
no , their object was plain .
she added politely , have you come to lunch ?
clarissa turned to address them all .
just routine , you know , routine .
dead as a doornail .
i remember arriving back here the next day and hearing about it .
thats a fantastic thought !
in touching terms it requested the pleasure of our company at tea in his sitting room .
' she shivered a little .
nicoletis humped monumental shoulders .
tanios attitude .
i will tell you exactly what happened .
but you wont let me say what i really want to say to you .
i shall go to bed early , said hilary .
) poirot looked at it a long time .
and theyre nosing round , asking me all sorts of questionsferreting out things .
the american had announced his immediate departure .
now what do i see ?
he took us up to a sitting-room on the first floor , sat us down on a sofa , and explained in dumb show that we were to wait there .
then i think that now weve got our chance to bring the crime home to him .
his daisy .
how you startled me !
youd think , after being shut up all this time yes , it is odd .
one is conscious of nothing elsewhether the pain will hold off or notnothing else seems to matter .
satipy and kait both smiled .
i only wondered pray excuse me if i am asking indiscreet questionsbut there was a young man , wasnt there ?
i suppose there might be servants , gardeners ?
i sought an interview with him on behalf of a client .
she climbed up on the bed and thrust an extremely tattered picture book under tuppences nose , commanding with brevity : wead .
crime seemed to have got above itself .
then the man called max ?
the car slowed down till it hardly moved .
but she is _num_ quick , she realized that she had , for one short moment , given herself away .
i said i wouldnt put it past her .
of course ill always be meeting her !
clarke suddenly burst out laughing .
so she wasid forgotten the womans name was wills .
and he rather spoke as though the other people who worked with him were merely assistants who didnt know exactly what he was doing or trying for .
and still we sat or walked in the garden and talkedour words becoming more and more of a cloak for our real thoughts .
i took a sample and had it tested .
her husband , sam cortman , was a big , heavy man , slightly ponderous .
miss waynflete stopped .
barber .
no rugs ?
the boys and bridget , however , decided to go along to the lake and see if the ice on it was likely to make skating possible .
he appears to be an agreeable young man , well bred , and well educated .
but if one had known them personallyi wonder if one would have been impressed .
poirot leaned forward , tapped him on the knee , and said with a beaming smile : blackmail .
thats your husband swimming in now , isnt it , mrs .
that , in itself , was true enough .
and then offend least of theseandmillstone sounds familiar .
it is only nine oclock .
odd , isnt it ?
not without his glasses .
all the ground floor windows were shuttered tight , but upstairs , on the first floor (it was a two-storied house) i noticed a window with a light burning and the curtains not drawn .
bantry urged her .
vii once again the sheep were assembled in the great fold .
this was soldier island !
i wrote to him that same eveningi mean the evening of the day dr .
we got used to it , i suppose , said mrs .
most people know a rolls by sight .
he led her to the staircase head and paused in the hollowed-out bay at the top of it .
and for the first time i looked at her in a different light .
i realized at once there was someone in the room .
i admit i do not wish it .
i ' m sorry , do you prefer a gasper ?
in the tio hotel .
by three oclock the fte was in full swing .
a pipe ?
it was his appointed task in life .
arent you always living in marguerite laidlaws pocket ?
inquired poirot casually .
i should say he was much better off than anyone around here suspected .
everybody had expected her to sell gulls point and leave saltcreek , but lady tressilian had not done so .
very old letters , yellowed with time .
she thought you were there for some ulterior reason apart from the declared one .
he will not find it so easy to alter that .
to take the post of gardener and report on the conversations and actions of the other gardeners .
you have no idea how disappointed our readers would be if they didnt get that sort of thing .
small pockets of men here and there who have gathered together for mutual protection and who thereby are able to outwit and control nature .
were getting going .
the arguments that appealed to me had no weight with him .
i have found out to whom raymond boynton spoke that night in jerusalem .
but i had my reasons for believing that it was done another way .
i drink wine ; my two companions at table drink whisky and mineral water respectively .
tuppence , hovering slightly between dropsy and diabetes , found herself slightly confused , but compromised on complications with the kidneys .
but now were going away , escaping from you , perhaps even going to be happyyou couldnt stick that at any price .
we havent really got to the root of the trouble .
such a nice girl , mrs .
nurse hopkins said : gerrard talked about it a good deal before he died .
that was a bad business about that picture , said mr .
that is the arab phrase used before starting out on a journey .
yes , that would describe it bestpanic .
then she motioned me to sit down , plumped down herself , and fixed me with a bright impatient eye .
inclined at one time not to take life seriously .
you may have heard why .
he took from his pocket a small piece of bamboo and three times during the journey he raised this to his lips , pointing it in a certain direction .
satterthwaite , i assure you that i should not dream of laughing at you .
she acknowledged the sentence with a nod .
its a bit of damned good work , although i say it .
on the other hand bessner had deliberately called attention to this fact .
there is a difference between sixteen and thirty-three , said zia ruefully .
melchett thought to himself : she could say more if she chose .
rafiel is asking me to do or try to do .
which last is stupid , said poirot .
ach , so , said dr reichardt .
he gave an ejaculation of relief as she came in .
there was something in her eyes i didnt understand .
yes , because of the tragedy .
they were five enemies linked together by a mutual instinct of self-preservation .
shes a very hospitable lady , by all accounts .
we were friends .
there was a faint sadistic note of amusement in his voice .
you cannot pass , messieurs .
ive got an idea .
welman might have left all her money to mary gerrard ?
in the last war i was scared every now and thenand had some pretty close shaves , and went through hell once or twice , but there were good times too .
i think mother would like to see you .
hes very tidy with his bones , you know .
vincent followed it with her eyes and winced .
just outside the door .
poirot took up the receiver .
that sinister threat tied her tongue .
miss susan he took to at oncea very spirited and handsome young lady , but its my opinion he couldnt abide her husband .
he takes from his pocket the plasticine-smeared mask with which he has already scared his wife on a former occasion and dangles it over the edge of the parapet till it taps on his wifes window .
shes older than she looks , but i think shes got a very good memory .
i think he was kidnapped , or else , as i say , dead .
he laughed heartily and lejeune laughed with him .
again there came that flicker in georges eyes , and mr .
nobody in the village has ever had any idea that old dr .
you can imagine what a thorn in the flesh i am to him !
its got to be a girl .
i returned in a minute with the waiting taxi .
er he hesitated .
there was no traffic except for a car jigging slowly along with the solemn demeanour of a bored dowager .
unable to discern any movement within , he knocked on the window .
these letters , though cautious , made it fairly clear that vivian dubois was her lover , but there had not been in the wording , so far as inspector neele could see , any signs of incitement to crime .
this is the same man that you saw overleaf , but now he has taken uppingtons health salts .
this will alter all my plans .
the police regarded it as a hoax .
albert lived in a small neat house a street or two away .
just buy something and eat it in the office .
she had on a black dress , sir .
i am to go back to londonand do what there ?
his face was very grave .
a man who was a cripple , only half a man , what did it matter where he was ?
they play for enormously high stakes , and theres a great deal of drinking .
you dont sound as pleased as you might be .
i became very fond of hattie , all the more so , perhaps , because i soon realised that she was shall we say not fully capable of fending for herself ?
coleman was a foolish young man if there ever was one !
there was , quite suddenly , a touch of embarrassment , or restraint , in mrs .
it referred to a mans body found near the docks in new york about three weeks ago .
very gently m .
but then , suddenly , i produce four photographs , and mrs .
as he passed those two men , he dropped his glove .
and if it hadnt been for an old maids foolishness , miss gilchrist mightnt be alive today .
as it happens my friend and i were wrong .
after all , i might be able to help you by poirot stopped his colleague with an airy gesture of his hand .
he wont do you no harm .
it is as though one went to a great trunk full of junk in an attic and plunged ones hands into it and said , i will have thisand thisand this .
the latter , speaking in soft pleasant devon voice , greeted poirot with a mention of mutual friend superintendent scott .
for a third person , surely , would have telephoned to only one of the two men .
i dont know , she said constrainedly .
that was the whole point .
i dont want a housekeeper , you know , to supervise things .
reiter ?
the superintendents ears must have been very much sharper than anyone elses .
who do they think they are , these students ?
ill send him along .
i remember her saying : ann , darling , it really is very embarrassing .
jacquelines cabin was just two away from dr .
it was at that time a six to eight-hour run , most of it on a very rutted road , and included the crossing of the river zab by ferry .
he was so still that he might have been carved out of wood .
you are a strong woman , a great deal stronger than i am .
he said : well and paused inquiringly .
that is what you did , wasnt it ?
there , it is a promise .
we were not surprised .
mrs vanderlyn is just a little too obvious in her methods for a wary old bird like me .
hercule poirot replied to the chief constables greeting in a suitable manner .
i dont mean it that way .
damn , it said .
but above the ear was a tiny hole with an incrustation of dried blood round it .
it must have been deliberate .
i dont really think my mother approves of them he laughed as though he felt this ought to be amusing .
david hunter was such a personit was not the world that lynn had been brought up inbut it was a world that held attractions for her nevertheless .
tommy suggested mendaciously .
is miss instow a pretty girl ?
everything seems left to the school , and of course they lead very permissive lives .
thats the best way you can help us .
the inspector locked the door .
humbleby bridget put in : mr .
but thats horrible , cried hilary .
she spoke of marshall indifferently with tepid approval .
they said they had seen everything they wanted , sir .
he conveyed as much tactfully .
to them the great shepherd was a martyr ; suffering , as all great teachers suffer , from the ignorance and persecution of the outside world .
the following morning , poirot showed me a telegram he had just received .
poirot and rosalie looked interestedly at the passengers .
what do you mean by someone ?
you mean unbalanced ?
i hardly thinkin a secretarys post you mean ?
only one person guessed my secret : nan wattsnow nan kon .
i was shy at first , and remained shy in many ways , but i was passionately fond of dancing and i danced well .
you have a sceptical mind , slack , said colonel melchett .
some tender heroine of a more sentimental age might have sought to keep her man out of danger .
to escape , she didnt know into what or where .
mrs cresswell had a marvellously dressed head of well-blued hair towering upwards in meticulously arranged curls and rolls .
it was simply too wonderful .
superintendent harper wiped his forehead and turned round to look at miss marple .
a mans used to a drug and they cut him off itcut him off ittill he goes raving mad for the lack of it and beats his head against the wall .
lance patted her on the arm .
in another minute one of the most charming girls i have ever seen was ushered into the room .
hes too much of a weight .
but then i have a trusting hearti always have had , ever since a child .
youve none for mine , said race .
now listenhows this ?
he amplified poirots statement .
with the american , andy peters , hilary felt herself far more in accord .
then he sought out jimmy thesigers rooms .
the list was , necessarily , rather a long one .
when reported cured by doctors , she resumed normal life , came often to stay with her sister and went out to malaya at a time when they were stationed out there , to join them there .
i had assumed , without pausing to consider , that what was wrong with them was the fact that they were written by a madman .
demanded miss marple .
kennedy , him as always said i ought to have had my adenoids out .
the second woman would kneel on the ground quite unsuspectingly .
willett can have known the old boy better than she says ?
the secret is out !
trevelyan , however , was not fond of women .
sooner or later you would give me the slip and accomplish your purpose .
without a change of voice he turned to rowley : did you think of killing her ?
theres no need to go into these details .
this clever lady here has thought out a most puzzling problem it will be such a novelty .
the young actor who had been talking to her was the person i wanted to confirm my theorythe theory that robin was not mrs .
a murmur of georges throaty voice came to him .
nothing that i can recall , said leblanc .
i know , charles darling .
i dont like just being made use of .
windleshams ancestors had held it since the time of elizabeth .
it was quite possible once mrs .
yes , renisenb , i do .
tuppence and i labelled this adventure wrong .
leidner wrote the letters herself the problem is easily explained .
had the dead woman gone to the grave in a last determined effort to save a young girl from death and disgraceor was there a different , a more sinister explanation ?
she was not youngprobably just under fortybut there was a contrast between her face and the way she was dressed .
miss marple shook her head , perplexed .
funeral friday .
forget everything , my friend .
but bert had a friend who works in a place where they make these new drugs and theres what they call a truth drug youve read about it perhaps in the paper and it makes people speak the truth whether they want to or not .
shaitana was a man who prided himself on his mephistophelian attitude to life .
derek stood up , scowling , his face black as a thundercloud .
weve got george lee and his wife , and david lee and mrs .
just for a weekend .
i think she does want to be left alone .
it interests me .
its not right to laugh at such things .
i had my answer in the blush of guilt that even rouge and powder could not conceal .
the telephone wires were soon busy , but neither the inspector nor the chief constable were over-optimistic .
its very unfair to begin with a rock , said fenella .
suddenly she uttered a cry of triumph .
and we know this much , that a few moments after leaving lyons mrs .
n-methylcyclohexenylmethylmalonyl urea , said poirot .
as you see , its stopped .
youre sure you werent expecting anyone ?
it would be fatal if any hint of who you are got about .
and then , just as i fired , that idiotic fool of a woman flung herself from somewhere upon me , yelping out , dont shoot .
after the cabaret everyone nearly gets up and dances , so at that time i am standing stilland that is why i can be sure that no one approached the table then .
oh , well , sir , she was a very superior sort of a girl .
we must abide by it .
the cable shall be despatched immediately .
ive told you things myself .
i strolled into the dispensary with a white coat on and a stethoscope round my neck .
she was in bed ?
your name is jessie hopkins ?
and then whoever it was rushed past me out of the room screaming .
if youll just let me explain i am waiting for you to explain .
rosemarys dead .
twenty-four hours ?
ackroyds voice rose in shrill horror .
weve seen a good deal of him since hes been down here .
there was the evidence of your secretary , major knighton , a complete outsider , whose testimony might be supposed to be entirely impartial , and there were the dead womans own words to the conductor of the train .
edward said , pushing away a velvet-covered tray : not emeralds .
a great many love letters of one kind or another had passed through inspector neeles hands in the course of his career .
was that why he had gone off after the inquest so hurriedly ?
either of them might be the murderer .
and she is teaching you norwegian ?
it would not really be fair , i felt , on the kendals .
we never got as far as that .
im always perfectly pleasant and polite !
i dont really trust that girl , you know .
here is major knighton , said lenox .
there was a faint question in his voice .
you have my entire admiration , madame .
said raynor .
cavendish declared that she had heard , from her own room , the fall of the table by the bed .
their voices floated out to me .
you , with your long witchs hair , and your eyes that are golden and brown and green and never stop laughing even when your mouth is grave .
she seemed , he thought , to have aged by about ten years since the time early in the afternoon , when he had seen her , the gracious hostess , welcoming her guests .
it was highly probable , she said , that miss springer had committed suicide .
what was there in isobel that soothed you , that took all your cares from you ?
he had brown eyesrather roundfair hair turning greya little moustache and rather florid face .
i dont think its a matter of general occurrence .
i know , i said , i know weve been over it a hundred times .
renisenb went on to the porch with its gaily coloured columns , and then through into the house , passing through the big central chamber , with its coloured frieze of lotus and poppies and so on to the back of the house and the womens quarters .
had a doze .
what have you been doing , josephine ?
but perhaps cora , with her odd childlike shrewdness , had read between the lines , and had crossed the ts and dotted the is of what richard abernethie had actually said .
i pinched cat stuff to put in his drink , and once i put a hedgehog in his bed .
and where was hannibal ?
but perhaps i could speak to his niecenurse edith , did you say her name was ?
no , no , never been mixed up with women much .
tim raised his eyebrows .
he drew his large watch from his pocket and laid it on the table in front of him .
you dont think carter nodded thoughtfully .
we could change the name of the house again , said tommy .
she was a tall , thin , depressed-looking woman , dressed in rather unexpectedly well-cut clothes .
the maidyes tommy was silent a moment .
they were happy years , we enjoyed ourselves immensely , and had a great measure of success in our digging .
he gave himself no rest .
miss marple murmured , flushing : so kind of you .
and then lotty came and took me awaysaid she needed someone to help her .
did he know all about it , too ?
the man who had told her to drink .
poirot looked inquiringly at me .
i thought she might possibly have written those letters to herself without being conscious of having done so .
the woman was taller than schwartz .
griselda is not too fond of lettice protheroe .
saw youd been drilled .
people came down from london and from the studiosyou remember last july ?
well , it may be , i suppose .
haydock breezed in , miss knight twittering behind him .
starkwedder asked .
our wedding was quite a triumphthere were no reporters there and no hint of the secret had leaked out .
but it sounds so melodramatic and hysterical .
how do you know thats what theyre really making ?
first class , fantastically expensive .
poirot replied .
when she reached the gate , therefore , she retraced her steps slowly .
im afraid not , jeremy admitted , with a smile .
victoria gave an exasperated sigh .
i think its an excellent idea .
luckily he died shortly after .
somebody wanted the drawer to slide in and out without any noise .
i suppose you think ive imagined the whole thing , said mrs .
but , tuppence , you cant really believe theres any chance of our oh yes i do , said tuppence .
she ended up by saying anyway she didnt know anything at all .
i do not know the details .
i went to the superb , sir , just five minutes walk away .
their boards , with the temperature charts pinned on them , hung on the bottom of the bed .
i mean , i dont know that the trustees would think it a good idea .
he asked her pointedly .
but another witness said quite definitely that that wasnt the sort of thing that lady stubbs would think about .
edward palgrove and negotiated a crisis with a horrible grinding sound that would have set a true motorists teeth on edge .
all the same i find other children very boring after her .
shall i take you in to breakfast ?
she was far too ugly !
let me help in any way i can .
but why , madame , why ?
greenshaws folly taken from the adventure of the christmas pudding agatha christie mallowan _num_ .
the hardness of a board to sleep on is unbelievable ; one would not think that ones hips , elbows , and shoulders could get so bruised as they do in a few hours .
on her third morning she looked out of her bedroom window , across the untidy lawn to the elms in the meadow beyond , and sniffed the air happily .
it was in some ways much nicer to travel by second rather than first class , since it was a much bigger carriage , and enabled one to move about .
instead he said : miss marsh is very fond of her cousin , is she not ?
i shall quite enjoy it , i shall really .
my dear poirot !
the time had not yet come when i could say to her : you are right .
mary fox , said miss arundell .
if lady stubbs had run away with a lover it would clearly suit miss brewis book very well .
king victor ?
papa , this is absurd .
the whole thing of going by the rhyme is mad !
pierces son ?
if jimmy thesiger was a friend of ronnys , the chances were that bill would know him too .
why did miss emily say she hadnt had any ?
it was this one , the one i have just given to you .
ive heard of you , she said .
i saw mr .
she put all on one number .
she only kept it up for another month or so , pointed out miss marple .
it would be very wicked and unfair of me to mention a name .
shes rather marvellous , isnt she , really ?
nobody had to sit up .
stanford lloyd and andrew lippincott .
the window was open just wide enough for a cat to get through .
no sooner had he departed than my government official reappeared .
parker pyne said simply .
ellis has a wonderfully light hand .
was it not you who introduced to me the phrase third girl ?
two owlish men stood on either side of archies bed , looking serious , shaking their heads , saying it was a grave case .
we can always get information .
it is , frankly , a stupid place to have steps down to the lawn .
yesso should i .
it cant be all true .
and by that i do not mean that she was specially deceitful .
but her manners !
it was now in a slightly precarious state and miss marple adroitly rendered it even more precarious by attention with a nail file .
at once she has what you call the wind up .
at the big four , of course .
you will never prove it , said henrietta , and , turning , she walked away down the winding path that led to the swimming pool .
christened by her optimistic parents diana , mrs harmon had become bunch at an early age for somewhat obvious reasons and the name had stuck to her ever since .
she picked her way stiffly down to the path .
you know , when people tell you second left and third right , well , you sometimes do it the wrong way round .
her eyes , anxious and scared , looked hopefully at hercule poirot .
i knew just what precautions to take .
he pushed the cigarette box across to her , at the same time taking one and lighting it , after one or two attempts , with a shaking hand .
end of meredith blakes narrative .
but i didnt want to desert you .
it was a fragment of ostrich feather .
have you ever felt like that , len ?
it wasnt edgar lawson or lewis serrocold or mrs .
a grunt from frank bristow whom he had forgotten made him turn sharply round .
i held on to him and shouted for help .
i was not listening .
for a moment or two she would wonder confusedly where she was , then reality would come back to her .
nurse craven tossed her head contemptuously .
i do not care .
oh no , we cant , said philip .
there was an expression of exultation on his face which i could not understand .
the hour has come for me to leave .
anyway , very difficult to prove anything so long as the family stick together and if necessary lie like hell .
there have been no developments there ?
wrens bedroom ?
actually , if she died intestate , her money would pass to her family ?
she ran down the garden and disappeared through the gate .
you stay here and look after him .
i let the matter drop , of course .
not that i was really tiredi seldom am .
more intelligent perhaps than the police were .
what was it that i was going to say just as that telephone rang ?
she said : ' i ' ve never believed in anything supernatural before - but now- to dream it night after night beforehand- ' ' it ' s extraordinary , ' said s ' tfilingfieet .
and that is ?
the photograph of jane finn , which would have been of the utmost value to the police in tracing her , was lost beyond recovery .
ginger persisted : nothing else frightened you ?
should he ?
shes the kind of woman who will break down at once when shes taxed with the truth .
i cannot doubt , from your hints and your continual allusions to the time i was in florence , that you have found me out .
he knew all the tricks that the police use , handwriting , typewriting tests , etc .
i felt responsible for my mother .
he sank on to the bed and gave himself up to reflection .
well , as far as that goes its very prevalent in high society .
but i dont think as that happened to nora .
this is commander challengerer but to my surprise poirot did not supply the name for which she was waiting .
spence nodded and the sergeant showed rowley in .
i elaborated it a little , brought a few more characters into it , and sent it off to them .
its just a damned queer coincidence .
an odd face , with its jutting chin and deep-set grey eyes .
ursula bourne , i murmured .
things were somewhat informal here .
tuckertons picture of herself continued .
what happened in actual fact to a young man who ran incessantly and persistently through the london streets ?
said lady tressilian sharply .
we do not know what we are looking for .
she wore black with onyx beads , and she wore a hairnet over carefully arranged grey hair .
on the whole he was well-satisfied .
miss marple gave an embarrassed little cough .
it seems crazy , i know .
i want that lump you had last night .
i never feel one has got to the bottom of jim .
he nodded his head in satisfaction .
and there is also the modernization , so called .
you may say , if you like , that i had overlooked it the day before .
the vicar came up to the sofa and looked down at the dying man .
quite so , he said , the position is this .
good riddance , said mr .
years ago , m .
bigamy !
monsieur demanded a small bottle of perrier .
asking them to call me , i put the instrument down again .
she goes easy on you when youre new .
i half expected it , said bundle .
i never heard it .
i may call you michael , since you are ellies husband ?
a pair of revolvers of my husbands were mounted upon the wall .
just the ordinary kind , miss .
i dont see what all this rigmarolewhat were these pills anyway ?
theyd got to find her before it was too latebut perhaps it was already too late ?
it cost me something , though , said flora in a low voice .
i thought you might pity a poor orphan girl , all alone in the world , and make her , perhaps , a small allowance .
i dont quite know , said jane slowly , as she puzzled her brows in remembrance .
the actresss engagement to sir richard everard , mp , had been announced a few weeks previously .
but wheres the poor soul herself ?
it still wore that absent , bewildered expression .
the traveller had only one small reading lamp alight and had placed his chair beside it .
and i dont know what it is .
go and look at the sea .
and then there was a message or a notice .
the last two hoursmore like three , i should thinkive been hopelessly lost .
they seem to be what you prefer , said percival .
colonel monckton went on .
caddock thought how incongruous it looked with her tweed coat and skirt .
this was the counts little joke .
i dont think she has ever driven a car before .
we were all adopted .
hes a sisters son .
she would warn hori of what was to come and they could speak freely together .
at a quarter past eleven she had gone downstairs for her eleven oclock cup of tea and snack .
eh bien , i saw at once that there was no fake , the cords had actually been drawn so tight as to cut into the flesh .
the ways of nature are indeed inscrutable .
i dont think that i would .
a would-be criminal could hardly be expected to welcome my presence .
she shook hands with him and jeremy cloade immediately outlined to her poirots suggestion about a will .
on the other hand , as medical evidence was to show , the cause of death was undoubtedly the poisoned thorn .
molly was struck , as she had been the night before , by the youthful jauntiness of his step .
these machines !
cant see much likeness between me and a film star , said cherry laughing , mores the pity .
hss lyall , whose pnncipal interests in life 	were the oh w _num_ nl)n of people round her and the souhd of her 	own voice , ed to talk a .
ifif i so much as speak to another man he makes the most frightful scenes .
asked gordon chetwynd , glancing hopefully at his wristwatch .
it was her job to obey her employers orders and sit here listening to what superintendent battle chose to say and answer any direct questions he might choose to put to her .
never mind , said bill consolingly .
oh , my god , i wasnt able to drink .
broadribb and mr .
which way now ?
nevile strange said sharply : shes already told you , battle , that it isnt her glove .
he feared that he might be suffering from a certain disease cancer ?
why , isnt that too extraordinary ?
her mind reverted to the problem of her own domestic comfort .
if the jewels had merely been thrown out by the side of the line , they might have been found .
bessners bulk moved up and down appreciatively .
thats the square , dark girl , isnt it ?
so that , in fact , it goes to mrs .
said reilly .
the only one i am sure about is the little sheila .
once or twice he had reiterated what he had said on that first evening .
her eyes were red , and she was sniffing violently .
we wished to confine our great dream only to the german master race .
luke passed over the paper , his finger pressed against an entry in the column of deaths .
she would have kept it up for a bit , and then gone back .
a visitor from london ?
quin seemed to have loomed to enormous proportions .
but its something to be sure .
giles came out of the window and answered gwendas unspoken question .
but me , i noticed when you spoke of it that you said : i pinched , etc .
her eyes , set wide apart , were hazel , a golden hazel that again recalled a memory of sunbeams .
her face had grown pale .
unfortunately , he had to return to canada .
george went in search of the owner of it , whom he found waiting for him in the drawing room .
partridge ?
do you think the collision was an accident , or done deliberately ?
we were just sitting down and mercado had told the arab boy to tell father lavigny lunch was ready when we were all startled by a faint , muffled cry .
i cannot be sure , of course .
fever my foot , i said .
so you didnt see his face ?
she doubted whether gordon cloade had chosen to marry a woman years younger than himself for her intellectual companionship .
carter spoke mildly .
martin , our new schoolmistress .
leo experimented before a looking glass .
no arrest was ever made .
first-class secretary .
theres one thing id like you to tell me , he continued .
brachycephalic , i murmured unwillingly .
her very appearance was negative .
he wouldnt take thatnot if he meant business .
wed like you to come and help us .
i wouldnt have crossed her when she was in one of her moods !
yet she has magicshe will always have magic .
yes , i warned her .
he was a quiet grey-haired man with a thoughtful face .
he had found it difficult of late to get his employer to concentrate on the matters in hand .
then , turning to face him , her eyes suddenly a light with hope , she looked at him questioningly , and then nodded almost imperceptibly .
slipped out without a word to anybody .
the footsteps had definitely passed his door going to the stairs .
anthony watched with a good deal of enjoyment , georges face turning slowly purple , his eyes bulging , and all the incipient symptoms of apoplexy .
i will recommend you to a lawyer who will do his best for you .
then theres mrs .
at any rate shes got colin where she wants him .
i call it supposing .
i ' ve got a few lines on de pounds itely a nasty fellow .
i will go and find him at once .
baker and asked , trying to make her tone the counterpart of the childish eagerness of the young american beside her .
and here emily began to cry .
bess threw back her head and laughed , one of the loudest and gayest sounds to have been heard in the lounge of bertrams hotel for some time .
poirot smiled amiably .
poirot , resumed the other , we english do not parade our emotions .
i rather think it was .
i see , said poirot , with a sigh .
harry lee ?
he was a thoroughgoing villain , i daresaybut he was a pleasant one .
vivien sat up , pushing the red curls back from her forehead .
somehow or other , i thought youd been out for a walk .
we know the kind of murder that has been committed , the way it was committed .
the second and third golf courses hadnt been made .
he thought to himself : whatever i ask for its sure to be off .
no , i know they dont sound the same kind of name but theyre the same sort of name in my mind .
kirsten used to sing it to us .
and so we made inquiries .
i just put the kettle on not two minutes ago when i looked out and saw you .
weve got to get ahead of them .
it is not elegant , that .
michael garfield looked at him thoughtfully , then he smiled .
poirot said with a smile : and yet , my friend , the actual descriptions of the women were not unlike as regards fundamentals .
carefully holding the various orders to view in his hand , with the littlegreen house one uppermost , he pushed open the gate and walked up the path to the front door .
cant you help me ?
you cant understand , i suppose , how extraordinary a temporary madness of this kind can seem to you after youve got over it .
whats he after , exactly ?
oh yes , the companion .
it is extraordinary how much of a fool one gentle inquisitive old maiden lady can make a man feel !
she folded it up again , then reread it and looked at mr .
i think youre lying , julia .
leigh gordon just to see what answer i get .
she smiled at me .
too cold in november and the blackberries are over .
they had been as good as their word , too .
or are the past and the future all one ?
i explained the circumstances of my brothers life , and how he had been finally sent home to die but had succeeded in living for some years afterwards in spite of all that the doctors had prophesied .
as the doctor went out .
multiple head injuries .
i know next to nothing about ella zielinsky except that she was a most capable young woman , and first-class at her job .
enormous success of the bottle stall .
i tell you , said tina , i simply changed my mind .
michael flushed angrily .
he spoke with a tragic dignity .
i wired for it from dover .
now , dont deny it .
he was fond of both anne protheroe and lawrence redding .
what was it that she saw that day ?
there you are , miss .
they had come to england , where his wife had lived for a short time as a child , and she was trying to trace old family friends and connections .
but you dont suspect him to have anything to do with it ?
the solitary witness of the shot manifested no surprise .
unfortunately its taken her this way .
you stood on your front doorstep : one whistle would produce a growler (four-wheeled cab) ; two whistles a hansom , that gondola of the streets ; three whistles (if you were very lucky) produced that new vehicle a taxi .
and thenand thenneil said , my sister sylvia , and i was looking into the lovely face of the girl i had just seen being suffocated to death .
nonsense , dear , nothing can be decided at a time like thisit would be most unfitting .
i love you to be mad .
ive come to report , sir .
thats more the ticket !
ellie did not answer for a minute or two and then she said with a sigh , i must write tonight .
hersheimmer turned to him .
she gave him the advertisement to insert , arranged for him to pay a visit to little paddocks to study the geography of the house , and showed him the spot where she would meet him and let him into the house on the night in question .
demanded claudia .
i cant believe its been as long as that .
oh , no , not philip .
not home , mademoiselle .
you cannot silence me now .
she kept poultry and was fond of animals and of a healthy outdoor life .
she knows him well by sight .
i saw it from the window .
it is not silly .
horriston was once a bona fide doctor , but he came a cropper of some kind .
she was , he admitted , quite a handsome woman in her way .
after all , theres the letter emma received signed martine crackenthorpe .
im sorry , madam , but all the evidence points that way .
gardener was scandalized .
renisenb glanced from one to the other of them in dismay .
and then she screamed .
i dont believe it , i said .
an attractive secretary or assistant had been the motive for many crimes .
every little irrelevancy had a bearing upon the whole .
and the awful things theyve built , too !
his father could easily have wired for arrangements to have been made in this country .
shes the straightest , truest creaturewithout thought of evil in her heart .
i mean , carlotta didnt bet .
two dogs slept in the room with her , and one of these now raised his head and looked at her inquiringly .
she told meafterwards .
yes , of course , said mrs .
if a girl is attracted to such a man she feels flattered by this appearance , and does not hold it against him ; if she has no interest she dismisses him from her mind .
he realized now that she was probably still under sixty .
of course i dont advertise that fact .
you consider , then , that death may have been due to curare .
as they came through the gate into the garden , the foremost of the two stopped dead .
it is extraordinary , monsieur , he said to poirot .
they were very inexperienced , he said .
he might , perhaps , pay off the mortgage , build small villas on the land and eventually make a small profit .
she used to get the general sense right , if you know what i mean , but the way she wrote it down used to make quite nonsense of it sometimes .
hed come back to london and started work with radley , and a year later he had married gerda , who was as unlike veronica in every way as it was possible to be .
japp murmured with a slight cough : you dont know , i suppose , if your brother left a will ?
this he adjusted with some care .
so he sent him off .
roberts smiled happily .
miss waynflete paused a minute , then she asked quietly : is that what you think ?
a blackmailer ?
you have forgotten me , dear , said miss marple , smiling brightly .
lovely as paradise and dumb as a rabbit .
taking a bunch of keys from his pocket , he moved to the french windows and undid the catch , flinging the windows open wide .
evans .
something must be done , imhotep echoed , looking imploringly at the priest .
i do hope so , because from a child i never have been able to look down from heights the descent was down the course of a waterfall .
she was able to hold up her head to the end , and shed no cause to feel ashamed .
there was a ballpoint pen lying close to his right hand , but his head was dropped forward in a curious twisted attitude .
i think ive always been afraid of you .
bantry , he said .
its no use resenting a thing that youve no power to stop .
poirot , i had every reason to desire my father ' s death !
that is to say miss dove herself had made it comfortable .
to begin with i dont hold life as sacred as all you people do .
british agent .
i dont know how youd look , said tuppence .
you look quite startled .
and it didnt seem real to her because she was now acclimatized in this present year of our lordreally , the whole thing opened up a very interesting set of problemsthe atmosphere and the peoplemiss marples fingers pushed her knitting farther away from her .
i would pray of you to make still further inquiries of the restaurants in the neighbourhood of regent gate and euston , tottenham court road and perhaps oxford street .
for gods sake dont try to be clever or think you can help me by some line of your own .
the rising excitement , the added beauty , the whole glowing radiance .
yahmose and renisenbmy dear son and daughteryou are still with mebut for how longhow long .
the house itself , a large but architecturally nondescript victorian mansion , was set amid an attractive few acres of gently undulating countryside , here and there heavily wooded .
he may have been madly fond of herand madly jealous .
durand immediately prescribed a sedative , and we have not yet been able to question her .
but it was in a way too easy .
yes , as you say , he signed his death warrant when he baited his guests with those words .
i wondered , said rowley , who he was .
i dont think he can be .
youve got to take into account that what he passed on to you wasnt exactly what had been said to him .
no its gone , and yet do not distress yourself , lady astwell , said poirot quickly ; it is of no importance of no importance whatever .
yes , many a nice present shes given nora .
she was very good , i believe , he said more briskly .
tuppence jumped up with a glad exclamation , and greeted a tall grey-haired man with piercing eyes and a tired smile .
and even the vicarage cat , butt says , is called after an assyrian king !
he was vastly entertained .
it was fortunate that she did not know that at that moment eggs bank balance was exactly fifteen pounds twelve shillings , and that the said balance had got to last her until december .
not regular , he isnt .
yet why this silence on his part about so vital a matter ?
its the only probability i can think of .
maverick who had a lengthy , technical discussion with mr .
no legal quibbles , now , said miss marple , shaking a knitting needle at him .
we were talking of crime just now yes , my friend ?
laura sounded desperate as , trying not to shout , she announced clearly and emphatically , i didnt shoot him , and you know it !
cyril might be rescued in time .
lawrence cavendish in any way ; nevertheless , the evidence against him was quite as strongif not strongerthan that against his brother .
fortescues vast sycamore desk .
lorrimer rose .
you think hebut hes far too oldor is he old at all ?
it was splendid .
gently she pointed out just what had gone wrong .
he said : his voice was urgentthat is all i can sayurgent .
certainly not to a double suicide .
) but whats happened ?
miss merrion bleated out in a high , distressed-gentlewoman voice : that is my name .
said joyce decidedly .
will you come inside ?
doesnt that strike you as rather curious ?
and i , for one , do not blame her .
but since to acknowledge that fact would be to acknowledge that essentially i am a failure , i refuse in my waking moments to face the truth .
' he showed the superscription - a typewritten envelope addressed to mrs ernestine grant .
she took two and left one .
thats where alice perry lives , that is , said mrs .
rosamund said energetically : i dont know anything !
droushcka petrovka navarouchi .
a feeling as of icy water trickling down his spine rendered harold incapable of speech for a moment or two .
two lives fell victim to him and he got away with it .
i had an uncle or a great-uncle , you know , who fell off his horse there once .
and was there something wrong ?
miss marple sighed for youth .
in both other cases the scene takes place in a psychiatric institution rather than a retirement home .
you and michael and i .
in that case , she wouldnt have had time to get up here and back .
he loved her very dearly , and then i dont know whether he discovered in her some characteristic , something perhaps that alarmed him or in which he found a repulsion of some kind .
anyway , it wasnt at that time .
ill attend to it now .
marchmont coughed .
the same laughing face looked up at poirot .
it was with considerable amusement that she saw her husbands face grow first red , then purple with astonishment .
with the help of a biddable builder it had been transformed .
its good of you to understand .
on arrival we plonked ourselves down on the plush couch in the hall , and looked half-wittedly uncomprehending when we were told that there was no room .
an anglo-indiana missionaryor , to go back farther stillan actressthereforenot rebecca arnholt !
you still assert definitely that the body was not that of your husband , robert underhay ?
but you will .
the mirror cracked from side to side .
well , she said doubtfully , you cant say that the subject isnt topical !
every now and then ii tell people things .
its just a question of bribing high enoughand finding the right manprobably the chief of police !
a momentary pity came into sir jamess keen eyes , as he gazed into the girls downcast face .
he flushed suddenly as he met his fathers eye .
bright blue .
japp asked poirot .
a cloakroom ticket , said miss marple , looking at it .
miss brewis had an enormous pile of letters in front of her which she was rapidly sorting into piles .
then perhaps i can talk to you for a few minutes if your mistress will not object .
and a lovely glaze on top they are such plump , dear things there is something , frank oliver said solemnly , infinitely comforting about a bun !
oh , what is it ?
the car my sister hires meets me at the station .
ill tell you what the police think .
time for her breakfast .
dr gerard and sarah king brought up the rear .
first time for weeks he hasnt been here first , looking at his watch and tramping up and down like a tiger at feeding time .
why , it gives us what we have been looking forthe motivethe hidden obscure motive !
professional .
the long lists of casts , directors , producers , photography and the rest of it passed her by .
a knife , mademoiselle , with which twelve people once stabbed a man .
their eyes and subdued snarls told of hatred , bitter fanatical hatred , but they had obeyed , cringed .
and disappears .
a very curious expression passed over poirots face .
out in the hell and messand here i am playing the foolacting the thing im really feeling .
what a good thing you came , mark .
you gave me instructions and i carried them out .
there you are !
i simply cant stand him .
easterbrookeither colonel easterbrook or edmund swettenhamdora bunner and bunch harmon .
its chilly , she said .
my moral nature certainly doesnt equal yours , but her point is that im hopelessly below you socially .
we then got into touch with the builder in charge of the estate .
i could not , i suppose , go to prison under a false name ?
i believe that is far more common than is generally known , especially at times of stress like those we are living through now .
i must ask you once more for an account of your movements .
jane followed him with disarming meekness .
you tell it all to him and hell advise you what to do .
that is true , agreed poirot .
lets go and buy some cars .
you blew up the bag and then hit it .
diana had thrown herself sobbing on the bed .
what did spences sister say ?
youre not a child , veronica .
the one person who did see it happen was marlene tucker .
did he come by appointment ?
of course , some time ago now but you was all mixed up with somethingsomething about nursery rhymes too .
now let us ' approach the question from another side .
after about a week i stopped thinking about it ; it was absorbed into various daily happenings .
what of ipy ?
one murder has been arranged and did not come off .
but the following is the plan i have concocted .
frankly , but for his mother , i wouldnt have kept him .
as a matter of fact , he said , im tired .
wondering the whole time if anything mores going to happen .
there were two stereophonic record players , each on a low table , trailing cords of snakelike flex .
drake , with calm certainty , was really a very silly little girl .
yes , said tuppence , but there was a lack of assurance in her voice .
ellis !
weve just got each other , havent we , darling ?
the inspector frowned .
what shall we do down there ?
hubbard found her newly attained ease menaced .
miss marple turned to him .
she gazed at him steadily and proudly .
imhotep began to splutter indignantly , meanwhile patting henets head .
and he drew out the envelope from his breast pocket .
neele only gave it a cursory glance for that particular room had had his close attention on the preceding daywith special attention paid to the small elegant desk .
well , he said , how are things going ?
it is not pretty , he said .
i caught sight of dicks bewildered face and began to laugh .
well , she asked us to .
looks a bit fishy for her .
and the next day certainly it was a shepherd now .
that will hardly do , mr .
patience is a great virtue .
my father obligingly racks his brains , but nothing comes .
robinson admiringly .
i played up to him .
theyve told me over and over again .
what ages ago , it seems , doesnt it , anne ?
he looked encouragingly at george .
but i have a reasonyes , i have a reason .
poirot bent down and picked up a small object .
not at all like mr .
of course , lady juliet weardale and young leonard are all rightbut mrs .
never mind her , jimmy , said loraine softly .
he said urgently : hallohalloare you there ?
shouldnt worry , if i were you , he said .
and yetit succeeded .
the stars fight against usbut is it the stars ?
are you sure , suzanne ?
and now he was to have a ministers portfolio .
how did you find marlene when you arrived at the boathouse ?
turned up last night .
from behind the closed doors of lewis office the sound of voices had been plainly discernible .
ive no doubt at all , he said , that youre a very reckless driver , and that youll probably run over some poor fellow and do for him one of these daysbut you havent done it this time .
she said that she expected my husband knew her own employer , squadron-leader g .
very meek and mildbut not really .
fred narracott shut off the engine , they nosed their way gently into a little natural inlet between rocks .
monsieur poirot , can you come to tea or sherry tomorrow ?
drive carefully , darling , wont you ?
but this time the door handle turned easily enough , and the door swung open .
there is something queer about derek .
' inspector jameson answered this .
you see my predicament !
poirot said in a gentler tone : it is of no use denying .
yes , he said ; as you put it , we have made our inquiries .
he was having a look through your papers on your desk .
there are hundreds of other things that you could do .
i came to london , established myself there , supported my mother and my aged grandparents in smyrna , extricated one of my brothers from the grip of the law , secured the freedom of my sister from an unhappy marriage and so on .
those quiet people often do .
i can see why you should still be hanging around portlebury .
i dont see , said battle slowly , why a good tennis player shouldnt be a murderer as well .
perhaps for some noble reason or for some reason that she thought noble ?
miss marple wondered as they returned to the house .
fond of rather obvious jokes .
and happiness , murmured raoul in her ear .
i sat there waiting .
miss tina argyle has a red bubble car , and it looks as though id have to ask her a few more questions .
' _num_ ' i understand , ' said poirot , ' that mr gascoigne refused absolutely ?
laura turned away .
miss brewster said again , giving her short gruff bark : no bodies on smugglers island .
you are going back to england tomorrow , arent you ?
silly name for a dogto call it after a packet of salt .
but if she did , the reason arose out of her instinct to dramatize herself .
i am just being a wise and careful husband , looking after something which is one of my favourite possessions .
very dependent on the person who attends and cares for her .
ill come down with you , said ronald genially .
the music , the roll of drums , the lowered lights , the cabaret and the lights going up again and rosemary sprawled forward on the table , her face blue and convulsed .
alfred lee , since tressilian saw her in the drawing room only about a minute before the row started upstairs .
after the first , they had not even dared look at each other .
and in the same way : yes , yes , they were shops , but i dont suppose they were constructed as we think they werethey might have been quite different .
if youd seen your facethere in that stuffy drawing room !
my conversation with nurse obrien confirmed that belief .
he shouted : put that child downor i fire .
include everybody , said major merrall .
her conscience was not satisfied .
he took some up in his hand as he spoke .
theyve been beastly to me alwaysalways .
faint voices echoed in the distance , and footsteps went to and fro to the bathroom .
if one guest is admitted , others cannot be kept out .
i dont want it to be a coal mine .
philips grief and furythey all seem natural enough .
he described four peoplethe big fouran organisation hitherto undreamed of .
burton-cox has any preference ?
the study window was open .
they cant believe that life can do these things to them .
now we come to the other two clues that we found .
i do appreciate it .
and i presume , since she was strangled , that it was a man who killed her .
he heard her murmur : againto waitso longso long .
) i shall be as right as rain .
three times , said mr .
the extra one was wasted today .
as they went up in the lift poirot said : i have obtained for you a job of great interest .
even you , my mother , deny my right to have a concubine like other menyou are angry esa interrupted him .
there was a sudden outcry of angry voices , the laurels heaved as two men struggled together .
i neednt tell you to keep your eyes open and make the most you can of your visit .
be careful what you say , dymchurch said menacingly .
he led the way to the deck below .
because at the time he was killed they were all at sittaford house and they all saw each other and they cant all be lying .
i knew youd have your feet on the ground .
should murder make sense ?
oh , yes , i did .
but long enough ?
of course quite useless now .
upward and eva kane are one and the same .
excuse my butting in on your case , she said with a sudden rather twisted grin , but i thought youd like to have the local colour correct .
no , youre not .
with whom will you share that life ?
shes simply game for anything .
i am glad you are going there .
your daughter entered into some action against your wife ?
your plan , i fully believe , stopped there .
no , i will leave you to hear it from mademoiselle .
dinsmead , almost in a whisper .
the clock struck the half hour after nine before mr .
i just had to act on the spur of the moment .
i was sorry about it , all the same , and hoped she did not regret all she had told me .
weve got a tame police inspector heregot to be careful , you know , when one of these millionaire blokes bumps himself off .
you may get tired of me , though .
an alien note had sounded , disturbing her complete satisfaction with life .
i pulled myself together again slowly .
something she put there herself .
tucker indulgently .
you know , mrs boynton , im by way of being a doctor .
i should like my bedroom slippers , she said .
did he go by car to the station , or did he walk ?
as i did last time .
but thats over and done with .
and that is that , he said softly .
nothing to it !
she is illdangerously ill .
the next landmark of importance , of course , was superintendent nashs visit .
somerset house !
he saw you , mademoiselle , in the mirror that hangs over the table .
hattie herself was at a convent in paris and was thus suddenly left without any near relatives .
up to a point i agree with you .
you did not know her before the cruise ?
that alters the complexion of things .
as to her , i have all the information i need .
tommy , the handshakes completed , smiled complacently .
he has been herehow long ?
she shivered and mr .
his nice kindly face looked a little disturbed and uncomfortable .
i remember once meeting a charming husband and wife .
cardew trench , why youre the size you are , marcus , when you never eat anything .
he added , after a minute , of course , without dr .
amyas who wanted to livewho enjoyed living .
have you any other appointments this afternoon ?
then you cannot have failed to hear the voices inside , especially as they were raised in anger .
ill not believe it , he said .
i was silent , but i did not agree with him .
he knew what a lodge was .
yes , everybody seems to agree on that , starkwedder observed .
it must have been made just at the time they were engaged .
iris was delighted .
silence .
jefferson are comfortably off , but that is not the case .
jack , you dont believe of course not , old fellow , not for one minute .
the reasons in another place .
her story has never varied .
and then suddenly the stillness of the night was disturbed .
i believe she did once .
someone recognizes him , mentions it .
alwaysalways .
ill think it over .
i give you a date .
and after that you went into the house .
at any rate , that was miss marples belief , but probably esther walters had not believed any such thing .
is a certain amount of danger in life a need of human beings ?
look here , do you remember a young lady who arrived by an earlier train , the _num_ : _num_ from london ?
hope youre not too wet ?
and yet i suppose youre right .
elsie nodded , enjoying herself as she relived past scandals .
sorry i couldnt come to the wedding .
julius sank back again into his chair .
must have been burglars .
she hadnt realized , somehow , how cramped it all was .
my dear aunt mary , he said , let me make the thing clear to you .
hengrave , blowing her nose , said sadly that that didnt matter at all .
the general eyed the tantalus sadly .
from the chimney had come down a mass of soot , of odd rubble and of broken bricks .
of course one knows , said miss blake , how italians go on .
easterbrook , and i have the habit of mentally registering what people look like .
unless theres something going on here that we dont know anything about , there doesnt seem to be any motive .
he and clare had played together as children .
in fact , take it all round , one way or another , weve done pretty well .
you say lowen had a grudge against mr .
i wish it would .
do people like her ?
i dont as a rule cotton to britisherstheyre a stiff-necked lotbut i liked this one .
not been in the wargot a bad heart or something .
albert chapman was only one of them .
and carefully , feeling her way , for here in devonshire she knew that death might be very near , she said : you are wonderful , edward .
she had never known quite how much until that november morning when she had first talked with victor drake .
my father who loved me not your father , mon enfanta man who came here after your fathers death , to impersonate him and lay hands on an enormous fortune .
tina shook her head .
the man paused , then moved towards the door .
i agreed to a nice banana and bacon sandwich .
you are a darlingand a stubborn fighter , but you dont begin to understand .
im not feeling for a revolver .
the present occupants must be lunatics with a taste for philanthropy .
i put that woman i told you aboutyou know , the one whos quite clever about researchi put her on to a few things .
i still think , said little mr .
i must remember to get a new bottle of quink when i go out .
she stared out of the window with unseeing eyes .
regards it as a personal insult offered him by fate .
she was dead , and death had occurred , i should say , about an hour previously .
the desire to be the first to impart news makes even pontifical butlers human .
there i must insert a few words of explanation as i do not know when these words will be read .
so youre still afraid of me ?
are you trying to say that it was commander chantrytony chantrywho murdered valentine ?
no finer points about the crime , but still undeniably , news .
george might resemble mr .
i mean a lunatic might think himself divinely appointed to kill doctors , or to kill clergymen , but not to kill both .
youll remember that we agreed that as things were between us , it would be as well to give up this farce of living together .
calgary , its frightening !
that was a good many years ago .
i must get on dry land .
dont tell gerald .
your best friend isnt dead .
nobody ought to be ill .
must be at least sixty or seventy years ago .
it was as though he pleaded with them for understanding , yet at the same time had no real hope of it .
some women havent .
hell put you up .
one other son , henry , who was killed in a motor accident in _num_ .
as all the world and his wife knows , on tuesday last a grand victory ball was held .
poirot went on : caseys daughter was a nun .
quin is interested inlovers .
perhaps thats why it appealed to me .
she took out a pale pink lipstick and touched up her already exquisitely painted lips .
but you know what he is like , that one .
just one person , he said grimly .
he said softly to himself , the honourable elvira blake .
armstrong for that part .
the guardian combined reportage and criticism : only seven weeks after agatha christies last play was booed off the stage , the old lady of _num_ [sic] stumped defiantly back into a london theatre last night .
he shot a quick uneasy glance at poirot .
i have seen a clever revue artist change her personality in the most miraculous way .
he got up and took his hat and stick .
no , its early closing day for the shops .
she sat so still that she might have been a waxwork .
well , said tuppence meditatively .
well , gentlemen , thats about all we can do here .
i declare i completely forgot tonight .
he knows this is my half-day .
still , said roger , youll be back this evening ?
chandra lal , is a most offensive remark .
i am absolutely certain that it would be a woman , and a good-looking one , replied tuppence calmly .
youll let me know about the quotation for the outing ?
they brought in a verdict of guilty , of course .
ive copied the next clue but it doesnt seem to make sense .
people , i have never had a good memory for .
besides , i doubt if olga could have put through the purchase of a greek islandor would even have been willing to do so .
he was the director of a museum expedition .
difficult to say without an analysis .
oliver nodded , and hurried back to the abandoned telephone .
well vet her properly .
a house that in my dreams i would live in with the girl that i loved , a house in which just like a childs silly fairy story we should live together happy ever afterwards .
i had to go in with the woman and have a drink .
that i should go to a south sea island was beyond my wildest dream .
what the hells the meaning of all this ?
a common , but very curious phenomenon , that , observed mr .
should he go round and see bridget before lunch ?
she looked as vivid and dynamic as ever .
exactly , and where they were standingout of sight , remember , of those coming after themtheres a deep tangle of furze bushes .
mcneil gave him a wide innocent stare .
oh my god !
anthony looked up sharply .
made his fortune , and built this place .
it was inspector primer , a man with a deceptively mild manner and a gentle apologetic voice , who had asked her if it would inconvenience her very much if his men did some digging in the garden .
i hereby confess that i murdered my mother by giving her an overdose of medinal on november _num_ , _num_ nigel stanley chapter twenty-two you quite understand your position , miss hobhouse .
it all sounds very depressing , said mrs .
in a funny way .
oh , he could see all right then , of course .
take the four-thirty train .
you want to get out of here , then ?
im sure youre just the person for louise .
mcginty had seen an old photograph and later she had recognized it reproduced in the sunday comet .
we might find out something .
what had she done when she left the house just after ten ?
in spite of all that dreadful trial and the horrid things that man on the other side said to me , and the way he battered me with questions .
a nun at stansfield grangeand at lytchett st .
judith said deliberately : hes very attractive .
there will be time for that later .
they went up in the lift to the third floor .
' you ' ve read this morning ' s paper ?
but after all , said jean , in a clear , priggish voice , although i quite agree about being kindwe oughtnt to condone that sort of thing , ought we ?
she was silent for some few moments .
wheres the old boy ?
i know thats what you said .
but , my dear , you have risked it .
that schools belief was that after sufficient treatment , lasting sometimes quite a long time , a year or longer , people could resume a normal everyday life , and it was to their advantage to do so .
well , what leaps to the eye is this : the motive cannot be obvious .
lucy spoke slowly , quoting the words .
always so pompous about things .
i shall try and get rid of it .
a little colour came in audreys cheeks .
one must say something , he remarked .
prince albert road proved to be a street of small prim houses , all exactly alike , with neat lace curtains veiling the windows , and well-polished brass knockers on the doors .
i rushed upstairs , and in a few brief words acquainted poirot with the situation .
boats of all sizes !
blodget & burgess who were on the opposite side of the squareand whose premises closely resembled those of messrs .
he beamed at hilary through his glasses .
you cant possibly do that .
it must have been about eight oclock .
something like that , or myra ?
the facts were quite simple and inescapable .
he was delighted with the miniatures and paid for them forthwith .
i noticed two very attractive looking young women .
id better go and look for mrs .
on the upward slope two girls in shorts with bright scarves over their heads and carrying heavy rucksacks on their backs were toiling slowly upwards .
it may have been david lee .
oh , i know , said mrs .
she was just as she is now .
a chinaman came this afternoon and lured me down here with a bogus message .
the affair bristles with difficulties .
just for once , as you say , it does look as though there was something in it .
she shook her head in some perplexity .
said dr .
you knowalways wanting to make a song and dance about some curse or something .
well , isnt it ?
' ' mrs allen was at home most of yesterday afternoon and evening .
possibly there might have been some kind of allergy to some particular kind of substance ?
but we can include hurstall and even barrett if we admit that shed take the risk of finishing herself off to avoid suspicion .
judiths feelings , she said , were too intense , too concentrated , and her instinctive reserve deprived her of any safety valve .
can you not leave it at that ?
i didnt want to see her reaction .
yes , more than you imagine , as i will show you presently .
missing clothes and suitcase , the farewell note .
it was about the solitary instance when i had seen him in a genial mood .
it was the sort of thing one would never know .
well , ive already told you that theyre not as romantic as they sound .
satterthwaite to himself , i must go in .
im sure i can tell you at once exactly what i was doing .
the girls face was alive with some emotionan emotion sternly checked and repressedthat he did not quite understand .
as far as you know theres no peculiar kink in any of the younger generation ?
i come here most evenings .
he was piling small blocks of coloured wood one upon the other , and seemed far more interested in the result than in the story she was telling .
the whole thing is fascinatingfascinating !
what , theories as to who did joyce in ?
did two men called andr and juvet come while you were there ?
lady horbury nodded .
i must write down the words sprawled off in a dash .
yes , it is rather , isnt it ?
preify girl of twenty-one .
i do feel such a complete fool .

reedburnthen he struck again , and he went down .
it represented , as emily could not fail to see , comfort and decorum .
jean dupont should ring up or call , be amiable to him .
but the countess , alas , is only a visitor to our shores .
you could have your own solicitor , mrs .
well , she wasnt the first to go down , and she wont be the last .
' ' who ' s quite nice .
much more fishy if theyd identified the woman as the missing martine and wed all kept mum about having heard from her .
but , said miss marple , the people of st mary mead react rather differently .
b for beresford .
but she didnt come from these parts .
i just hate her !
will you have some tea ?
a girl has her feelings !
me , i like to feel that my door is locked on the inside , even if the good curtiss is in the adjoining room .
she threw off her tweeds and got into her overall .
curtiss ?
early tomorrow morning would be best , i think .
he turned to sir rowland .
my hand had only painted what my eyes sawdrops of blood on the white pavement .
pretty friends , who allowed you to be decoyed out to death .
why , the fact that bauerstein demanded a postmortem .
but it would never have occurred to me that a day would come when there was no domestic help .
we were major despard and mrs .
he merely said brusquely : nowto recapitulate times and places : the last time you saw gladys martin was in the hall before tea , and that was at twenty minutes to five ?
it is tuppence who takes the initiative at the very beginning of the secret adversary in drafting the newspaper advertisement and it is her brainwave to amend it to read intriguingly no unreasonable offer refused .
no , as sir charles has already said , the guilt must lie on a person who was present on both occasionsone of the seven on your list .
yes , madame , it is i myself .
once the pleasures of evil get a hold on you , you cannot draw back .
but i found something interestingat least i think its interesting .
and was most particular .
thank you , said van aldin .
a skeleton had been found beneath the floor of one of the houses he had rented , and most of the women he had married had never been heard of again .
will have your little bit of fun , wont you , sir ?
they wore their tawdry clothes with an air .
at twenty , there wasnt a girl anywhere id have changed places with .
the word slipped out involuntarily .
she spoke to valerie of trouble - of gathering clouds ; hen she turned up the last card - the covering card , they call r .
as far as i could see , yes , sir .
jennifer herself died a year ago .
but someone went to major porter .
what more would you expect me to say ?
whatever is the master doing ?
the fact that her breakfast had been excellently cooked and served , with good coffee and homemade marmalade , in a curious way annoyed her still more .
you should have stopped it !
she was going out on her bicycle .
what day do you usually go out , prudence ?
ii the picture broke up , wavered , refocused itself .
im sure sir oswald doesnt want you .
a lot of professors on them lecturing .
rogers went round with the coffee tray .
drake would like to believe that the murder never really happened , but she cant very well go as far as that , can she ?
there should be no more warsno more povertyno more disease .
poirot paid the fare .
i knew a case once , began mr .
but he always seemed so fit .
just at first i fancied it was my lilys voicesomething like hers , it wasbut haughtier if you know what i meansort of high up in the air .
pender smiled at her , and leaning back in his chair and taking off his pince-nez , he began his story in a gentle reminiscent voice .
third visitor _num_ .
very few women have .
tell me that hey ?
it might have been a drama on the stage !
kenneth graham .

' ' one of the stewardesses had a voice not unlike hers .
thirteen mrs .
we might cable him to tell us all he knows about race .
why , she said , was the hat cupboard locked ?
no , said leo , i have nothing to do this morning .
i wont tell the police anything .
morley , as he proceeded to tooth number two .
shed be mad if she didnt .
but to people like ralph paton , turning over a new leaf is easier in theory than in practice .
tommy started in pursuit at once , and was in time to see them turn the corner of the street .
at seven oclock there came a tap on the door .
then , with elaborate care , i would tie a large blue satin ribbon round her headwith enormous difficulty and holding my breath , because tying a bow is no easy matter for a four-year-old .
it was nothing really .
youve admitted it all ?
as to that , said stafford nye , who isnt ?
i will leave a few words with albert .
come and have tea with us .
i shall sit up until _num_ oclock but no longer , said mrs .
they want sound stuff .
real crocodile , i think .
it was a pistol of very small calibreas i say , probably a twenty-two .
i asked her to tea today .
ill write it to you .
abruptly , christine redfern got up and went into the hotel .
not that one could really bully henriettashe wasnt made that way .
you are an idiot , jimmy .
yes , i can see that that might be so .
trefusis nodded .
sir henry said : there is one more thing .
if i ever said i did , i lied .
i shall have to make new plans , i suppose .
theyre better left unsaid .
lee , that you didnt telephone at all .
there were also some clothes in the wardrobe .
and theyd go therebut not as themselves theyd go togetheror separately ?
how should i know , renisenb ?
sheppard at the breakfast table mrs .
they might , i suppose .
but this onethe sereniteshe hadnt seen it there until the day after he died .
furthermore , mr .
mind you , i think mrs .
even saying one of thems mad doesnt help .
naturally i wouldnt hear of that .
then quimper backed her up .
they said it was very unfair and a very stupid thing to have and that anyway they thought it was really a most disgraceful thing to go on having nowadays , because you had to say if you had children and if you were married , or if you were not married but did have children , and things like that .
after all , shed had a grandfather who came up from being a dock labourer to a millionaire .
yes , she is .
she murmured : tell him we thank him and we will pray for him .
miss lemon dropped her hands into her lap in a resigned manner .
in it there is no fashionable doctor , no fashionable dentiststill less is there a fashionable milliner !
seems a bit odd , i admit .
strickline , was it ?
i dont know anything about archaeology and i dont know that i very much want to .
julian harmon himself had clearly been a model designed by nature for the age of sixty .
her first husband was a fine chapfine mind , i meanbut terribly delicatetubercular as a matter of fact .
shes the kind of woman , said miss marple , that everyone likes .
motive for murder of dr .
his decision took him to the nearest post office .
her feet , her hands , were numbed and dead .
a good many of them he already knew and these he greeted with nervous nods of the head .
i told henry i just couldnt go on with it , said mrs .
rather a nice garden , but terribly overgrown since the war , because theres been only one old gardener left .
jackson told him , of course , said miss marple .
i dont like modern houses .
upward had gone to bed and that the others had not yet returned .
hercule poirot said quietly : granting that your ideas are correctwhat will happen next ?
i will also take the passport , please .
butler , miss miranda butler , mr .
the idea of tampering with the interior of a car seems masculine in conceptionthough many women are as good mechanics as men nowadays .
it was very cold in spite of the heating .
i found his embarrassment and partial withdrawal of his former claim interesting .
my sister dora , over to combeacre , she had a narsty experience one daydrunk , he was , and selling those little printed poems .
yes , she had locked the front door soon after four oclock .
they both agreed that he seemed to be in great agony , that he was unable to swallow , and he could only speak in a strangled voice , and when he did speak it was only ramblingnothing sensible .
vandemeyer , and as he did so he winked .
charles !
the question is , he said , did alfred pollock know that the old lady had made a will in his favour ?
perhaps wickedness may find its physical curethey can sew up our hearts , deep-freeze ussome day they may rearrange our genes , alter our cells .
you dont catch me a second time , he replied .
in a bank , as a matter of fact , but i got em all out and i began sorting through them because i thought why not write my memoirs .
as he was on his way back , mrs .
this is all rather private .
anyway , im asking you to give me money becauseif you dontshe stopped and then went on very slowly and evenlyif you donti shall say what i saw you doing to the cachet that day in my mothers room .
they are amiable amateurs ; they often become friends but they seldom command the awe with which we regarded our domestic staff .
youve had all this before .
i gave them good presents of money and told them to send for the british consul .
bouc could reply , he rapped sharply on the door of no .
dont give me away to percy , will you ?
my father suggested that he and my young daughter josephine should have a private tutorthe choice at the time was rather limitedsince the tutor in question must be ineligible for military service .
nothings the matter , said dr .
what are the trains back ?
at _num_ : _num_ p .
poirot smiled indulgently at the bronzed face in front of him .
shes got such a lovely figure .
i never can tell a story properly , ask arthur if you dont believe me .
she was goingwell , queer .
this is interestingvery interesting .
it was risky , but it was possible , for any of the house party to have slipped into the dining room and put the nicotine into the port glass .
he had not seen that room before .
its not as though there were a treasure chest hidden in the house , i agreed facetiously .
she thought she knew the reason for this appearance of prosperity .
i am particularly interested in reading books by those who have been in contact with criminals , especially those who have tried to benefit them or to find ways of what one would have called in the old days reforming themfor which i imagine one uses far more grand terms nowadays !
fortune and you are superintendent bell .
people yawnedwent off to bedthe lights went outthere was darkness and stillnessthe golden palm tree slept .
erwith the countess , yes , admitted mr .
hardcastle joined them as sheila entered the car .
consequently you , who have just been thwarted in obtaining what you want , naturally resent the existence of people who have been more successful in life than you are .
she was annoyed and spoke out more imprudently than usual .
but i still dont seem to remember what i ought to remember and the doctor says it may never come back .
whilst i was at the university .
i wonder the lawyer tapped the table thoughtfully .
oliver thanked her for the information and rang off .
he said : oh well , if you think so i am sure of it !
is in boisterous spirits .
i was left alone in this strange underground nest of luxury .
and you dont see the explanation ?
there was nothing to say .
of course it was suicide .
she said presently : i was taken through a lot of formalities .
but it isnt his legally .
graves had gone again .
it was this room which he had been directed to enter .
its very difficult , mrs .
i cried , amazed .
she passed the paper over to me .
im afraid its rather a bad business .
the air minister was a little round man with a cheerful smile .
and i have always felt , you know , that nurse harrison had her suspicionsnot that she ever said anything , but one can tell , cant one , from a persons manner ?
take it on ?
you are wise .
look anywhere you like .
i thought i could manage the servants .
the only thing he had ever said about his health was the admissionnot as young as i was .
its very doubtful , i said .
chekhov , was it ?
they had come to the wall of the convent .
redferns first act was to slip out very earlyby the balcony door which he unlocked from the inside (if found open it would only be thought someone had gone for an early bathe) .
i shant need you , barbar , he said .
did i sound like that ?
i can only assure you that the conversation wasthe madness of an evening !
the shape of a face , the curve of a jaw !
she was greeting him in a level rather monotonous voice .
of course i wont bother you alix broke in hastily .
peter lord said slowly : then your minions who made inquiries in germany did bring you something .
bridget was here .
miss pebmarsh went out to the post office and the shops but she turned left instead of right , and that telephone call , according to miss martindale , was put through about ten minutes to two .
on perfectly good terms , i should say .
shall we begin proceedings ?
they both stopped dead inside and something like a muffled cry came from the ex-soldier .
the general opinion in the servants hall , sir , he said , and paused .
do you actually know that she thinks that ?
not even a compromising bequest !
id been carrying it about meaning to give it back to rosaleen when i saw her .
something not quite natural about the way she lay .
' 	poirot murmured mildly : ' but i have not said that i suspect m .
forgerys out of the question .
i expect its more comfortable here , said midge .
plain as a pikestaff , said inspector slack triumphantly .
i have no idea , said the girl coldly .
i said , no , thank you , and she deposited the dish with a clatter on the table and left the room .
the three went behind the screen .
poirot replied : a depend .
george looked at him in shocked surprise .
pilars worth any two of you put together !
it might just as easily have been illness that he was concealinghis colour had been bad lately , and he had been overworked and overtired .
by jove , that explains why they looked at me so queerly when i spoke of questioning her .
i dont know what were coming to .
we call him mister harley barley .
he joined her on the settee .
but shes expecting you , i know , so if youll come up and wait , please .
poirot , is tomorrow .
he examined her now more attentively .
i know that i shall remember if i see it again .
hitchhiking his way across europe .
there is a proverb in your language that says so .
woman trouble , i gather .
he could reinfect the wound every time he dressed it !
i blush when i say these things !
one might run away from reality into a half world of ones own and then , of course , after a time , one wouldnt be able to get back .
she was looking in the driving mirror again .
savage was a hardheaded business man and while he might be quite ready to have an affair with a pretty woman , carstairs didnt believe he would leave a vast sum of money to her and the rest to charity .
miss marples sharp eyes were looking round the room .
shed irritate me .
miss bellever said sharply : really , mr .
the pain went through her head again .
he smiled encouragingly at them .
at that minute i could have put my hands round her neck and squeezed the life out of her inch by inch !
kettering had met a friend unexpectedly .
bess sedgwick was looking at him very intently .
she read out a list of figures .
that also is most kind , but i will sleep on my yacht .
remember one or two of them in my army days .
after the death did he come over and look through her papers ?
you seethat might be anybody .
is there no one in this house , no member of his family , who desired the death of sir claud , quite apart from any question of the formula ?
oliver stopped .
not in the rural pockets of the land .
it was a deserted stretch of country road and there was no one to help her .
ill attend to this part of it , he said tactfully .
bidlock gave me five of her coupons for that old tweed coat of mine .
miss marple added : you see , theyd already had one little talk .
we are feeling all right , dear , arent we ?
the first one ran : i meant well .
got something for you , we have , said clarence .
please forget what ive said .
no , said tuppence , i believe the girls led verywell , pure and austere lives and they married young , though often into the peerage .
about half an hour , sir .
what the devil do you meantheyve got her ?
he looked round at a circle of uneasy faces .
room _num_ .
lord listerdale had a lot of house property .
what is going on , albert ?
jealousy ?
he said rather weakly : im sure there are many people who could advise you better than i could .
well , im glad she had the pleasure of planningat all events .
her tone was disdainful .
tuppence was alone at the far end of the beach .
she was breathing hard and the expression in her face made valerie exclaim : whats the matter , mum ?
the wickedness was never therenot in the sense it was supposed to be .
she just asked for the number and waited and then the exchange must have said : im trying to get them as they do , sir , and she said : all right , and then suddenly she yawned and said : oh !
marlene didnt get that scarf off of the lady down at the cottage .
he sneered at mealways very polite but underneath i could see that he didnt like me !
of her tastes , of her hopes , of her fears ?
is flying home to states on _num_ rd .
not very far , said mr .
i said , youd examined all the things she took , hadnt you , when you came to see her ankle ?
how horribly you put things !
this time we had won .
anyway , we shall meet , i expect .
a statesman in these days has a difficult task .
the weather ?
but more than ever i wondered how much colonel race knew .
pushing the table aside , he swept them away with him to the vestibule .
but under the circumstances there might still have been hope .
upjohn rose to her feet .
' ' was wednesday her regular day out ?
there are always unscrupulous tools to be got hold of , said isaacstein quietly .
quin had some distinct significance attaching to it .
a pang smote me as it was tossed down on the table .
it would come better from you , sir .
i knew then that it was fateand that i couldnt escape .
cardboard .
you seem to know a lot about mr .
i should really like you to see what i have got .
he was fair-haired , sir , and short .
the conversation took a usual course .
asked miss peabody .
then we began to talk of family matters , and stephen farr said something about seeing we wanted to discuss things , and he took himself off .
i rather wonder youre not there too , peel edgerton ?
she really is an excellent creaturebut a complete fool , as i said .
you may know , mr .
especially , added hercule poirot , rising and going to the bookshelf , when expense is no object !
we wondered , you know .
supposing , for instance , that madame giselle had knowledge of a certain criminal offencesay , attempted murder on the part of someone .
there was someone watching him .
oh , just give her a few facts for half an hour every day .
not treasure .
with her cool , equable poise , this woman of the western world seemed a negation to tragedy or heart burnings .
its great fun being a grandmother .
a bit of luck finding a tool like that .
hilda hesitated , then she suddenly made up her mind .
she carefully lifted the frying pan from the stove , then neatly shot its contents onto two plates , one rather fuller than the other .
asked for the day off today , he did , said briggs .
ive learnt patience in the east .
graingers tentative suggestion of a sleeping draught .
he capitulated at once .
betterton , said miss hetherington reflectively .
narrow winding streets , high walls , and occasionally , through a doorway , a glimpse of an interior or a courtyard , and moving all around her were laden donkeys , men with their burdens , boys , women veiled and unveiled , the whole busy secret life of this moorish city .
_num_ a .
hes delegated power to the last sort of people he ought to have delegated it to .
she makes them happen .
years ago when i was a youngster .
oliver fished a gaily covered box from its paper bag .
victoria asked : the real documents ?
a religious picture , but also a painting of a happy mother with her child .
that charming creature , his wife , quietly shoots mr .
so far , so good .
monsieur poirot , said the lady in a soft , musical voice , i am in great trouble .
poirot surveyed her gravely for some minutes .
its a nightmarethe whole thing is utterly incomprehensible .
at the same time , i honestly believe that there is a kind of meekness , a predisposition to martyrdom which does arouse the worst instincts in men of a certain type .
a blow on the head .
normas father stared at him .
the commissary introduced us , and explained our presence .
not a monster , said race .
the third man was hugh .
ive asked him to come here , he said .
it seemed the kind of understatement characteristic of miss martindale .
once again i could not help regretting that my friend was so prone to lose his head in moments of excitement .
heart , i should imagine .
not a word of me to anyone , madame .
sitting with her chin supported by her hands in the entrance to horis little rock chamber next to the tomb , renisenb stared down at the valley below .
and edith binns , too .
that does seem indicated , i agreed .
you send them clothes , said miss marple , childrens clothes and womens clothes .
i didnt want to see indulgent amusement , or stark incredulity .
i dont know what you mean , said mrs .
carlotta adams looked across the table at her hostess who was at that moment turning her head to talk to poirot .
if only there was someone who would answer questions reasonably and intelligently .
it seemed all right to begin withthe usual sort of young man that deb often has in tow .
leidners devotion to his wife more than i do , he was saying .
french , i expect .
and i believe hes there still .
here we had a lovely case of suicide .
i thought you were in london , superintendent battle , said anthony .
his hair is white , and his whole aspect that of a man terribly aged .
said bill , his countenance assuming a brick-red tint .
all the same , mrs .
charles osborne on appointment with death poirot ( _num_ ) the mallowans spent what was to be their final pre-war season in the middle east in _num_ , when they moved from tell brak because of the blackmailing pressure of the sheikhs of the shammar tribe who were obviously bent on inducing our workmen to strike , _num_ and set up camp more than a hundred miles to the west , in the balikh valley , remote marsh-like country but a paradise for the archaeologist .
if i have a boiled egg they cant tamper with that .
chapter _num_ aunt matilda takes a cure i a cure of some kind , i thought ?
that is true , said poirot .
he can repeat them accuratelythat is , not transposing them , as nearly all of us do , to what the impression made on him was .
the room where mrs .
) had chosen it .
the woman stood there , clutching betty tightly .
i did my stuff pretty well this morning .
after having made a great fuss about going to meadowbank and being quite sure she wouldnt like it there , and saying it was a snobby kind of school and not the kind she wanted to go to , now she sulks all day long because ive taken her away .
oh , indeed , he would !
i thought that was the end of it all .
but we were just saying that nobody else at that sance had any relation with the family , and not five minutes later we see ronnie garfield having tea with captain trevelyans sister .
we reminisced together in perfect amity over the various happenings of the world tour , saying occasionally to him : you really did behave atrociously , you know .
it had come to him before now when he was in his cathedral stall , and did not know whether he had already preached his sermon or was about to do so .
and the cherry pie on the walls ?
but it will be more difficult in your problem since it seems the answer must be one of two things : that the husband disliked his wife and wanted to get rid of her , or that the wife hated her husband or else had a lover .
hes gone down to the farm .
vandemeyer had worried me when julius told me about it .
sergeant fletcher is out there now .
she was kindness itself .
told me to stop here while he was away .
shes not ill !
we will have now an interesting conversation tte--tte .
she had , i thought , distinct charm , but charm of a somewhat negative order .
i think i can understand that it must be very sad for you living here with the memory of the past .
emily took the parcel she was carrying and unwrapped it .
he looked so comic i couldnt imagine it .
got where ?
i turned my horses head and rode away .
london .
i wonder , she began .
and what about the extra coffee cup ?
my students they will leavethey will all leave .
symmingtons poise was pretty good , but he looked desperately tired .
quite over .
i was allowed to see her only at visiting hours .
i shouldnt likei dont want .
we finished the tom thumbs , said tuppence .
a few feet away lay freda , bound like himself .
yes , i think its a disappointment he hasnt got any of his own .
much the same as i always was .
i imagine that he handed her out small sums of hush money , and proceeded to make his plans .
no , sir , i do not .
but then i couldnt see your face .
shooting little glances sideways at anthonys immovable back , he moved softly round the table .
he started by biting his nails , and now he has to do it in every single book .
dash it all , im not suggesting you strangled the girlnot the sort of thing youd doi know that .
anthea was tuppences goddaughterand antheas daughter jane was at schoolher first termand it was prize giving and anthea had rung upher two younger children had come out in a measle rash and she had nobody in the house to help and jane would be terribly disappointed if nobody camecould tuppence possibly ?

i may be wasting your time .
barbara sounded bored .
i heard nothing .
her aunt sniffed disapprovingly .
now let us talk about mrs .
thats what i got cornworthy to write .
there was a sudden outburst of sobs .
oh , i know , said mr .
laura took a few steps away from him , putting her hands to her ears .
doncaster will be thoroughly warned .
my name is poirot , hercule poirot .
then you think that there is a possibility that she is right in her views .
hester said : if this is going to take a little time , could i ring up first , please , gwenda ?
all that we can .
she does gym and p .
i particularly want you to see the new sports pavilion .
the inspector fell in with the suggestion readily enough .
do not be so impatient , satipy .
that is what has happened in this case .
ive got most of them written down here .
i seethats where i come in ?
should i be glad if she died tomorrow ?
little carla .
said to auntie , i did : you oughtnt to have a man like that in the house .
fane beamed .
but he has a somewhat violent temper , has he not ?
if hes hanged for something he didnt do , hes got something to complain of !
just because shes a jolly good-looking woman bundle was only too well-acquainted with this unfair masculine line of argument .
he would have had to lean across her to put anything in her glass .
yes , that may advance us a little .
i fear not , monsieur .
in another minute we were face to face with the mysterious madame daubreuil .
did you notice if that was bolted too ?
would it be worth repairing or would it be better to have it pulled down ?
i have a messagefor this housegive back what is not yours .
from now on i occupy myself of everything .
he has no illusions , but he has a genuine love of his work .
the general himself did not notice the smile .
miss rich is good at sketching people .
yes , i suppose you get a lot of your information that way ?
was interested in education , what girls were fitted for , how to encourage them .
and she is not stupidno .
tim started to answer her , caught sight of fernando and went over to him shouting out some directions .
a fat lot of use its been .
ryesville , valley forge , pennsylvania .
nolet mademoiselle bella duveen go .
major norman touched poirot on the arm .
and so you should , dear lady , so you should , cried major palgrave gallantly .
i think hes got something for you , i said noncommittally .
iyesi suppose so .
so easy for these men without children to speak like that !
never ad no luck .
yes , they married about a month ago .
the way he knuckles under to that chit of a girl of his is downright disgraceful .
once or twice ive seen it standing near this hotel .
she told you ?
good eye for a cricket ball , too .
theres a regulating number on the oven .
cest lenfantillage !
i clear the mind .
i dont remember any definite leave-taking .
when the constable had called us , i had run out with the inspector , forgetting all about johnnie .
i have the offer of a good post for him and i thought that after discussing that , i would bring up the other topic .
no natural gallant impulse swayed him , his shivering flesh was but obeying the command of the alien spirit that called for sacrifice .
i am surprised really to find you here .
she stood there for a moment or two , still not looking at what she was carrying , but towards the hall below .
and after all , from their point of view i was placed in a position of trust and abused it shamefully .
he leaned back in his seat , studying herwondering what these english relations of whom she spoke were likewondering what they would make of this spanish stranger .
i dont know really what you expect me to say , monsieur poirot , she said .
i beg your pardonbut could you tell meif there is anything to see in exhampton ?
she and young lesley were running an affair , and then lesley took up with another girl .
otherwise the room had little to yield in the way of information .
yes , yes , i remember .
no , said jane truthfully .
henry regarded his wife somewhat uneasily as he admonished her , you must take this seriously , dear .
such a sweet baby it was , too !
a hairbrush is a very good thing to use to take the bubbles out .
ive heard hes in a terrible state of nerves stilljumps if you speak to him .
pretty bad luck for a young woman .
six of her books with signatures .
not that i wouldnt be willing to help if i could , she amended .
no reason to think he and his wife are not all rightbut all right .
i see that you do not , said poirot drily .
that very old man , mr .
the line is perhaps not very clear .
i express myself so badly .
especially if youre delving into the past .
linda said : because her husband was in love with arlena .
she broke down completely and had to go into hospital .
i could see you were interested .
on the other hand , if you were once really a friend of his , you were a friend of his .
of course , you should have come .
he paused for a moment and then asked casuallyalmost too casually : any particular horse you had in mind ?
laura puffed at her cigarette .
theft of famous historical emerald .
when miss reilly was speaking to me on the subject of the dead woman , i said to her , jokingly , that i hoped she had an alibi .
i know major rich so well .
you seem to know all about me , m .
she has , of course , a kind of appeal .
nono , not exactly that .
you looked at them well ?
i remembered your name .
the pleasure of doing you a service will be more to me than a chequeso you permit that i retain the box .
i wanted to look at it once again .
a revolver ?
but you had to remember to think when you had seen them last , whose daughters they were , what link had led to your being chosen as a godmother .
and unless one has an explanation that will fit all the facts (as i was saying to dear mr .
my father was looking at me .
thats why it all seems such nonsense .
yes , i thought , we all wanted evidence that mrs .
satterthwaite , who thought that he had an attractive back .
i was surprised to find that the man was a stranger .
my dear boy , its the only sensible thing to do , with our ideas so different .
i asked for it specially .
the figures of the doctor and the nurse grew hazy .
whatever his mysterious activities had been that evening could not affect the case .
a book that had been given me as a christmas present , illustrated by walter cranethe feast of florarepresented flower pictures in human form .
(vouched for by antonio foscarelli .
nick may insist .
there are several things i want to say to you .
the rumour spread about that he was deadbut some people said he had gone abroad anyway , nothing was heard of him until he turned up , dead , on miss pebmarshs sitting room carpet ?
yes , on the night that linnet doyle died , someone saw you leave her cabin just after one in the morning .
according to the orthodox point of view arthur carmichael merely suffered from loss of memory , lady carmichael lacerated her own throat in a temporary fit of mania , and the apparition of the grey cat was mere imagination .
it didnt show me .
im pretty sure they didnt , as a matter of fact .
he said : one could go down these stairs , go to the left round the hotel and join the main path up from the causeway .
the inquest was to take place on the following morning at _num_ oclock .
cela va sans dire .
blore , that i kept an extremely sharp look out .
didnt you know how to answer them ?
tuppence removed herself .
if you ask me he treated her bad , that fellow did .
he laid his hand over mine , and , soothed and comforted , i dropped off to sleep once more .
trying a touch there wouldnt surprise me .
i followed things out in my mind .
maurs summary disappearance from the cast of damn your eyes .
not at all glamorous , but could be attractive-looking if she tried .
sheshe hates us !
the bottle was about the same size as the cough linctus one .
clues abound , but you must watch for them and eliminate the red herrings poirot himself deliberately plants about his past .
dering , and i want that statement verified .
im going to be late and so are you .
they know .
ah , by the 	way , one word of advice .
preposterous and childishly worded as the demand was , it yet brought home to her a grim atmosphere of peril .
paravicini playing .
naturally , they both reacted quite differently .
first i go all out on the idea shes anna stravinska , and then shes out of it he was arrested by miss marple giving one of her small peculiarly significant coughs .
very bad luck on him .
six houses rejected the novel before it was finally published after puzzling over it for eighteen months before deciding to go ahead by the bodley head .
several times his plans had miscarried .
up to now , ive bungled it .
graham was sitting on his loggia with a book .
rubec nodded soothingly .
grace herself was in raving hysterics by that time .
ross was a young fellow of about twenty-two with a pleasant face and fair hair .
gone out on the river , she explained .
eh bien , mademoiselle , all through my life i have observed one thingall one wants one gets !
of course he says he was in bed and fast asleep , said lady astwell , but who is to know if he was or not ?
tina , i think youre lying .
oh , madame , pray do not trouble yourself .
com agatha christie dumb witness a hercule poirot mystery to dear peter , most faithful of friends and dearest of companions , a dog in a thousand contents cover title page dedication _num_ .
i dont think it was quite that way , he said .
the spirit says her name is ada spiers , and john here is going to marry someone called gladys bun almost immediately .
does he speak english ?
he was silent for a moment or two , then resuming his normal manner , he said in a quiet assured voice : the victim is a man of middle age .
well , after all , if it were found in the neighbourhood , it might be argued that davenheim himself had dropped it .
his hair was brow but his eyelashs were almost white which gave his eyes a paic , boiled appearance .
she bit off a retort that was on her lips .
youth was to him so much the most magical of all gifts .
what about daphne theodofanous ?
hilary was to leave for fez on the following day .
you have taken the point admirably .
what onexactly ?
it was just that mother had that effect upon me , said hester .
i feel .
this needs looking into .
most of the time i shut up like a clam .
aunt effie ?
she was a very pretty girl .
some unappeasable hate perhaps .
quite so , madam .
yes , im afraid as hed had a drop too much .
but robbie , i gather , was not preaching .
a faint colour rose in philips pale cheeks .
he went to london yesterday , they say .
in fact , it leapt to the eye .
treves complacently , are as good as ever they were .
pat disregarded these admonitions .
as they left the presence , miss carnaby murmured to her friend : he really is a very handsome man .
for me , husbands would be out .
in the same way the handle and the head of the racquet were joined together again by means of adhesive surgical plaster .
suddenly julius grasped his arm , and pointed to where characters were appearing in a faint brown colour .
everywhere was snow , deep drifts of itno mere powdering an inch or two thick .
if you turn your head you will see her .
the writing was quite large and had once been written in a very deep blue-black ink .
such a thing has never happened at bertrams .
the veronal is beginning to work .
and its curious that they should come to live here in winter time as they have .
i havent seen edward for ages .
i dont mean the barnabys , i mean to the ravenscrofts .
cortlandt van snyder of the use of her tongue .
then i sat as though turned to stone .
i dont see that that gets us any forrader , he said at last .
and my coming here is , perhaps , somewhat of an impertinencebut im an old man and i believe in plain and direct dealing .
at all events , let us examine the position from the point of view of murder , not of suicide .
she turned once more to wetterman .
it is almost expected of him .
renauld .
you do not think it strange that he should use exactly the same expressions in his letter as madame renauld used , later in her story ?
harbottle left her quite dumbfounded by saying that he thought she had kept house for him long enough and that he was making other arrangements .
didnt mince his words , harry didnt .
all right , he said hastily , ill do it .
rosalind explained that it had not really been peters fault : she had told freddie potter not to put his face near peter and make whooping noises .
gardener sank down .
there , he said , there you are .
i , m .
husbands , ive found , are a credulous lot where illness is concerned .
we were strolling through the streets more or less at random .
i dont think the old lady has any power over her , and for that reason she hates her with a bitter hatred .
from dinard we moved on to guernsey , where we spent most of the winter .
nicholas was eighteen .
we got to her in good time .
there was of course no such thing as sunbathing on the beach .
why didnt you stop her going to the nursing home ?
i dont like it , said mrs .
a ford tensea-green .
caroline had her hat on , and had evidently just come in from the village .
i need air .
think of being a companionalways having to be pleasant and agree and stifle yourself and bottle yourself up .
ill tell you whatwell go and ask grahamhell know .
i should like to go there .
you dont sound very enthusiastic about it .
of course i see your point , said anthony cosden generously .
employ the little grey cells .
proposing to me .
but one could not do that in this country .
armstrong stared at him for a minute .
dont be impatient .
she took a bus over to darnington on the day i have mentioned and purchased this compact .
he said sharply : for heavens sake dont take the commonplace view .
he and i have worked together for years before i even met louise and also he is the wrong age .
this was something else .
those particular lapses were strangely familiar .
he said to me , vous ntes pas un pcheur srieux .
(but when this was hinted , deborah would say , oh , mother , dont be so terribly _num_ .
what are you carrying in that kind of black folder thing youve got in your hand ?
katherine looked at him for a minute or two with those thoughtful grey eyes that said so much .
not specially , i should say .
goosey goosey gander , whither will you wander ?
sixteen it was the next day in the afternoon that as i was walking rather rapidly in the darkest part of the wood where the shade of the pine trees was more menacing than anywhere else , i saw the figure of a tall woman standing in the drive .
with no particular landmarks to guide him , as far as victoria could see , richard baker directed abdul with gesturesthe car now to the rightnow to the left .
i should think she was the kind that could pass through doors or windows .
poirot had an uncanny flair in these things .
we were boy and girl together .
he took up two objects from the table .
crackenthorpe mrs .
neither of them are back yet .
when i realized that this girl must have taken the dagger , i warned you .
its a cornish name , isnt it ?
i knocked at the door .
colonel johnson called : will you ask your brother-in-law , mr .
yes , i think i see now .
he retired to a cubicle , scratched his head , used several pencils in turn , groaned , and after about five minutes brought us what seemed a very reasonable account for the enormous amounts we had eaten .
whos this paul lopez ?
poirot wondered how old she was .
hed been so bitter about uncle alistairso full ofwell , hate really , that i felt if he could only see himsee what a nice kindly unassuming person he wasthatthat he would feel differently i couldnt arrange a meeting here because of mothershe would have spoilt everything .
she had kept verity , kept her there at the old manor house , in the garden , kept her there for ever .
his hand went over the glass that tim was holding to mollys lips , his other arm had fastened round tim .
but shes going to marry him ?
she said cheerfully : what do you want to know ?
but to say your father killed your mother is an extravagant statement and isnt really true .
its one of the barbiturateswhose toxic dose is very near the effective one .
you wont !
one whose word was once law in belgiumand shall be again !
ii lost my head rather .
there was only one change , and that was for the better .
pritchard , i always have told you that blue as a colour is repellent to me .
poirot said : if he is innocenthis innocence will be proved .
his whole demeanour alteredbecame stiff and official .
anyway , i remained sufficiently modest to say occasionally , without thinking , yes , but then of course i am not really an author .
i think somebody shot at you with the intent to kill you .
richard amory put his coffee down , took a magazine from the desk and began to browse through it , as his aunt developed her borgia theme .
so , he said , that is that .
she asked as she sat down .
he became acquainted with the franklins and at once i scented danger .
a waiter passed softly round the table filling up glasses , murmuring champagne in an undertone but all attention was on the one glowing spot of lightthe black woman whose ancestors came from africa , singing in her deep voice : ive forgotten you i never think of you oh , what a lie i shall think of you , think of you , think of you till i die .
the medical evidence had been a bit above their heads .
his very words .
when she took them away , trotter was staring at her .
but there were other stomachs unaffectedthe stewards , the other passengers .
baker wood .
well , there was a bit of information i was going to get from a pal of mine , another newspaper man , carruthers his name is .
no , mon cher , that is just what i could not do .
its knocking round somewhere .
i would rather you told me .
joyce paid no heed .
he couldnt have been poisonedbut he was !
father and mother did that once , but they found it so hot on the moor that father hired a dog-cart and drove back into torquay to sit in his own garden practically every afternoon .
of course the police have already searched it thoroughly .
descriptions of that historic place can be found in any guidebook .
well , well , to business , said poirot .
excuse me , said poirot , you have not yet completely read this letter .
then carol began talking feverishly about mosquitoes , and her father backed her up .
the people who went to that party .
you yourself cannot help us in any way ?
in fact she replied very gruffly to my morning salutations and continued to eat in silence .
ah , you mean his first wife .
still carrying the small parcel in his hand , he went downstairs and out of the house to the garage , where stood a scarlet two-seater car .
for one thing wed like to know just exactly what his movements were on the night when michael gorman died .
but do you think im talking nonsense ?
indeed , i would prefer that you asked .
shell do , he said .
poirot paused a moment , then resumed , when i arrived i was not shown into mr .
pippa suddenly laughed .
but it didnt scare you ?
miss marples eyes had gone to the cachet box .
poor daddy , she observed .
dont go worrying about that , at this time of day !
he was sprawled face downwards with his face in the water where a hand had held him while he drowned .
he was making a fair salary , had a little money of his own , and the two proposed to be married quite soon .
shes a great artist .
i forget where i sent it next , but once again it came back .
they are painstaking and they never give up .
a most remarkable letter , he said .
then there was a sudden commotion outside .
it has taken an awful load off my mind .
he said : tell parker i dont want anything more tonight , and that hes not to disturb me .
its just the mercy of heaven youre here , said mrs .
graham dryly , is so considerate as to use arsenic .
but where did a telephone message come in ?
riots .
he preferred something softer , more feminine .
the letter from the girlfrom that poor child .
it was most irregular , but the lady is without doubt young and beautiful .
i poured it out , yes .
not precisely , said macwhirter .
poirot , they told me you hadnt gone yet .
im sorrybut i dont believe you .
poirot said calmly : i understand your meaning .
now , can you do what ive told you ?
there was a brave flippancy in his voice as he went on .
he turned his head and looked keenly at miss jacobs .
and the photograph ?
secrets are known .
cant imagine , said tommy .
theresa laughed suddenly .
were afraid theres been an attempt at robbery , and we want you to help us .
kramenin felt the muzzle of the revolver pressed against his ribs .
asked david .
good morning , horlick .
i suppose theres nothing that either of you has noticed since youve been here that might have a bearing upon the case ?
the situation reminded james of some of his favourite works of fiction .
he told me that himself as a matter of factwhich rather takes the taste out of it .
but it was someone in a hurry , someone who hadnt the time to search quietly .
and you told me i could .
and she is not pleased , no !
but one never knows .
i must go easy with him for vandas sake .
for me , there should be illumination !
as you saya greek .
it will be some days before his private papers are examined .
ive not been in the news like you have .
he said : i did tell you once , long ago , that i hate it when people are ill or unhappyit spoils everything for me .
leger is being run at doncaster ?
halliday make any mention of his plans for the evening ?
annette and i didnt know what was going to happen to us , said tuppence .
she gave a little sigh , and then became practical once more .
five girls sat there , all very upright and all glaring at each other .
do not assume things , hastings .
so this was arranged .
as you say , it may be the best way .
meredith blake ?
that i believe , with all my heart and soul , that i am necessary to the continued peace and well-being of this country .
but all the same yes ?
to find a policeman at the gate and a rumour that somebodys dead .
i looked at poirot , warily .
words trembled on my lips , but i did not say them .
poirot spoke slowly and deliberately .
oliver , in a deeply depressed voice .
wellnot exactly but she met him andwellgreta fixed it up for us to go there as a matter of fact .
murder in ones next door neighbours house does not usually go unnoticed , said miss waterhouse .
a ladys maid , perhaps .
so it would seem that living in broadhinny was a young woman who was the daughter of the celebrated murderer craig and of his mistress eva kane , and it would also seem that that young woman would go to any lengths to prevent that fact being known .
then they go and dance .
a russian did it , you say ?
and his voice , when he spoke , was becoming a childs voice .
this affair of yardly chase , is it , as you say , all fixed up between you and mr .
how much later ?
they are in the little room at the end of the passage .
but im certain it wasnt the real reason that brought him here .
did you notice his hesitation when i asked him if he saw marthe daubreuil on the night of the crime ?
the elderly woman beside her said briskly : im very annoyed with myself for being so easily taken in .
oh yes , i think he did that in fact , im sure of it .
miss whittaker took the statement at its face value , but when she mentioned it to miss emlyn , miss emlyn realized the really interesting thing about it .
he could have come in through the side door , said craddock , just as scherz came .
you do not know of your own knowledge that it was a quarter to twelve when you left heryou only know that she told you so .
gerard pounded a fist suddenly on the table .
very intellectual , im sure , but whats the point ?
she emerged feeling smart , modish , up-to-date .
no , indeed i didnt .
colonel race was looking straight ahead of him out to sea .
private action is still not to be excused .
perhaps i dont know myself .
i burnt them at the first opportunity .
the mist had increased .
she has taken to you , mrs .
vivien poured out the whole story .
so wicked the way people went about saying things .
rafiel reflected a moment or two , then he shook his head .
doubtless james was unduly touchy .
there is such a thing .
when he returned weary and jaded at half past four , he found tuppence extracting a bag of biscuits from their place of concealment in one of the files .
letting you hunt round end house .
i shall be all right , said victoria and smiled happily .
she was hit on the head in her own house .
why not say the woman died from heart failurenatural death ?
turning rapidly to the left and then to the left again , she stopped in the arcade of a shoe shop until bridget , rather breathless , rejoined her .
the courage to give yourself up or the courage to commit murder ?
come here , sircome here , i say .
and once or twice he murmured to himself .
he was wondering why maurice gilchrist was saying what he did .
perry , dropped down the chimney in the other house .
moira was lying like one dead , except that her breast moved up and down ever so slightly .
not married , i think .
dingy blinds were drawn down over the dirty window panes , and there were no curtains .
absolutely inadequate .
but rest assured , my dear colleague , we shall do our best .
odd , how little you knew about people .
the answer seemed to appease the lady .
bantry would have told us this story .
yes , heroin , snow .
some common fellow far below her in station .
if ronald had moved to regent gate , his former address was hardly likely to be needed .
hes been serving a sentence , but his time was up a few months ago .
but presently he saw what one may call a way of recouping himself .
i meant something startling , surprising .
lydia said , two more guests ?
all right , said ellie , ill be there .
she talks of going to live abroad again .
heres to murder , he said cheerfully .
did it seem to you that the intruder was definitely aiming at miss blacklock ?
she who is well and strong .
the door of amys room , for instance , turning the key in the lock from the outside with pincers after id changed the bottles by her bed .
constantine with interest , does a pukka sahib mean ?
im tired of secretaries , i wont have any more secretaries .
the question was solved for me one day when i was having tea in an a .
what he means by a man behaving suspiciously he doesnt know himself .
it justwell , happened , you see .
he went to the window and opened it .
she had bad manners and i conversed with her as little as possible .
since all the telephones in ramat had been tapped , bob and john edmundson had worked out a little code of their own .
i could stay in the house .
miss h .
when are they going back to school ?
he spoke deliberately but quite simply .
you dont even say what youre going to do next .
she looked like a meditative angel .
bessner rose .
hundreds of young couples were scouring london to find anything that would suit them at a reasonable price .
and it isnt just that ?
and i look at mary and i feel i dont know anything about her .
she remembers all these and talks about them .
you see , hastings , a gimlet and all the rest of it .
i gather something in that line .
the person who didnt like him , i think , was my father , but i believe that is almost inevitable with the fathers of charming and gay daughtersthey want somebody much better than could ever have been born at all .
was monsieur laurier an emissary from the organization that had persuaded thomas betterton to leave his work , his home and his wife ?
was he so dreadfully unhappy ?
aldbury .
and hard on her last cable she arrived and had to be taken round the neighbourhood with lots of orders to view .
well have to get to the bottom of this .
i apologized again .
why did you not leave it to youragentto choose her own time and place ?
after all , weve got to have someone outside toer to what ?
and she blurted the whole thing out .
you see , ive been telling fortunes all the afternoon , so i havent seen anything of what was going on .
word by word , i got the thing told , shuddering as i did so .
there was no reticence about mr johnstons past .
im not quite sure of it .
seldom did he get such an intelligent and sympathetic listener .
poirot , is important .
i came in inch , said miss marple , producing the usual confused effect that that remark always caused .
shut the door , he commanded .
im crazy about him .
thats what is going to be the teaser .
he sprang up from his seat and darted out .
max will be delighted .
on the contrary , said mr .
such is the power of an evil conscience .
so it was very important that the body should not be recognizedhence all the cayman camouflage .
he and his mother were such perfect companions that the sight of him absorbed and interested in another woman always startled mrs .
we established ourselves on the grassy knoll as poirot had suggested , looking out to sea .
parker pyne quietly .
the first was an almost unconscious action , the body obeying the mind as the body of an animal does .
you like not that i should embrace you or display the emotion , i know well .
darling tuppence , there was not a girl in the world to touch her !
it is most kind , please , said one of them , a fair girl with a foreign accent .
his evidence was longer , more detailed .
there was something in his eye that was unusual .
theres never been any other .
of note : the producers of murder on the orient express released a film version , also well received (though not by mrs christie , who had passed away two years prior) , of death on the nile ( _num_ ) , this time casting peter ustinov as poirot .
i offered him eved jewel i have .
thats the true womanly spirit , said bobby approvingly .
its possible that this martine may have had a background that would not stand investigation .
however , we pushed this worry out of our minds and continued to surf desperately whilst we could .
harris ?
something that made her afraid .
but , by the time i had reached the top of the stairs , he was out of sight .
i felt certain that he wasnt going to get any sleep .
its not always a good idea .
said lucy bitterly .
barrie wrote some very charming plays , said miss marple , though i must say that when i went with an old friend of mine , general easterly , to see barries little mary she shook her head sadly , neither of us knew where to look .
the american ambassador , mr .
its a question of prestige , said philip .
when shops changed hands there , it was with a view to immediate and intemperate modernization .
did he urge you to reconsider your decision ?
she began to suffocate , her head reeled dizzily , a roaring sound came in her ears .
disliking her .
wrote to me ?
she stared .
he was more or less tied up with a woman called sandracant remember her name for the momentsandra somebody , yes .
they were alone together .
the american grinned .
i am convinced that that was no pose .
parson and the churchwardens daughter !
father lavigny , he explains to me some tablets , and i take one to the window to see betterand , ma foi , not looking where i was going , i steb the toe , and the pain is sharp for the moment and i cry out .
is that - is that really the word that ' s in your mind ?
heres a little something weve dug up on mrs .
they are all here , correct , in their places .
where did sir gervase go after tea ?
' here are the chantrys , ' she said .
hebraic people .
he would find a letter when he got back to his roomsexplaining , protesting , saying all the things that women do when they are excusing themselves for lack of courage .
i neednt describe in detail how i followed her down to marlow .
we dont really know anything much about the household .
we get a dozen a day , at least .
paynter had been ailing in health since his arrival at croftlands .
you suggest that their faults are more important than their virtues ?
some day , i hope , there is a lot of happiness coming to you , lettice .
i think the hot coffee and fried eggs did us all good , though no one actually felt they wanted to eat .
he was essentially a kind little god , she insisted .
the medicos have a long word for that sort of thingguilt complex or somethingand dont believe it was deliberate at all , just carelessness , but that he wanted to make it important and serious .
his interest lay wholly in the crimeswooning middle-aged ladies did not interest him at all .
i should say , madame , that you yourself have been an active worker in many welfare and social fields here .
reasonable , mon dieu !
a mans voice demanded harshly .
your wife has not confided in mr .
we know because we had a book that said she didnt die a natural death , but shed still have to be buried somewhere , wouldnt she ?
ill be sending phillips along later .
giles sounded incredulous .
hes probably been banking on the food-poisoning theory .
calculated to distract attention from the plain fact of administration of poison .
ellis is the third murder .
shes quite good-looking , you know .
goby , and took out a very scrubby little notebook .
but now that he mentioned it , i saw the faint traces of semitic ancestry .
you noticed it at all ?
shes not seriously hurt ?
she mentioned the abercrombie caseyou know , the welsh poisoner .
the first thing i saw was an elderly woman with grey hair sitting in a chair .
poirot nodded , as though convinced , and we turned away , but he suddenly darted off and began examining the other flower bed .
but thats not so in this case .
we managed pretty well between us .
johnnies terribly proud of it .
see for yourselves .
if you please , stop .
i will send my friends to you , monsieur , if that is what you desire , he said haughtily .
just by chance .
and for wine , mademoiselle ?
in preparation for your visit , i have given her a strong stimulant .
weve been all over the continent .
its all a cold buffet , you know .
if anyone had dropped something im sure somebody would have screamed .
boyle was killed .
mrs eccles put her handkerchief to her eyes and sniffed .
i think , i said slowly , it was mrs .
ten to one the doctor was dead or had gone away from dillmouth .
ino , not exactly .
he spoke to her without looking at her .
yet in the middle of this absorption in business matters , one little fact lay at the back of van aldins mind .
nodding to hugo , he added , good evening , mr birch .
yes , she said quietly , that was not evelyn howard who spoke !
the preliminary to it was what was called sorting .
angela sutcliffe was a well-known actress , no longer young , but with a strong hold on the public and celebrated for her wit and charm .
and then , said poirot , we shall see .
for the first time almost , since he had come back to england , he felt that he was talking to someone who appreciated his own feelings and point of view .
then he said : a good bluffbut i call it .
ariadne oliver had gone with the friend with whom she was staying , judith butler , to help with the preparations for a childrens party which was to take place that same evening .
and then there are the others .
something rather important has happenedoh yes , of course that will be all right .
philip looked at her thoughtfully .
at a quarter past eight a second gong was heard , and immediately after the door was flung open , dinner announced to the assembled guests , and a solemn procession wended its way to the dining room .
but there are two facts that to my mind are unmistakable .
come in , please , and shut the door .
poirot looked suddenly across at katherine .
then they would leave the place , wherever it was , after inquiring for the supposed carol and when they got outside the village carol would hastily change back into her own flamboyant clothes and her vivid makeup and would go back there and drive off in her own car .
a lot you care about what happens to me .
thats better , he said cheerfully .
they were kept on a special shelf in the medicine cupboard in the bathroom of his part of the house .
was it miss temple who uttered the cry ?
she had convinced herself , hadnt she , that walter fane was the man ?
turner , written from london , instructing him to sell up the place as quickly as possible .
i cant go on guessing .
we used to follow up tracks through the woods and see where they led .
enderby hall was a vast victorian house built in the gothic style .
possibly he agreed with it .
but i gave my word .
nothing less would have taken that gentleman in !
poirot , who was very quick-witted , read my mind and his eyes twinkled a little .
oh dear , there they are again !
poirot said : was he fond of the child ?
rival moved with some slight uneasiness .
my only living relation then was my uncle andrew , who had recently returned from australia and bought a small place , crabtree manor , in his native county .
poirot showed you .
dolly was in the house .
puzzled , uncomprehending , shocked , they cast abashed glances at the trim , upright figure with its neatly-parted grey hair .
he maynt take it lying down .
therefore it behoves me to put my affairs in order .
shall we say tomorrow night at the same time ?
i dont suppose she took veronal every night , but shed evidently taken it for some time .
but it is always the facts that will not fit in that are significant .
it was all mine .
well , who did ?
taverner went quickly out of the room .
hilary merely said , yes .
before thatwhere ?
he laughed rather mockingly , but i saw his face harden .
vandemeyer was either dead or dying !
i found the books on theosophy tedious ; not only tedious , i thought they were completely false ; worse still , i thought a great many of them were nonsense !
beresford , said tuppence .
it seems to me that now the only chance is to come out into the open .
poirot went on : not well at allthat is the answer !
it was an enchanting spotwhite , deep greenand sapphire blue .
if only he had stuck to the main road !
hall turned an appealing face to sir james , who smiled slightly .
eileen was my instructress in chemistry , and was frankly a great deal too clever for me to begin with .
yes , shes dead .
observer : livelinessinfectious zestas good as anything mrs christie has done .
youll do that if its the last thing you ever do are you staying on with rhoda ?
sometimes id say he was a typical englishman , stupid to the core , and theres other times ill catch a look or a word thats not stupid at all .
shes a bit unbalanced sometimes , norma .
undoubtedly , but for him the murderer would have escaped scot-free .
ive fixed the murgatroyd .
mary nodded again .
the third key fitted the writing table drawer .
never about when i want you .
you said to me only yesterday , madame , it is a very wicked world .
mother asked suspiciously .
quite extraordinary .
to have actually hidden it in his room would have been a little too much for the police to swallow .
inglethorp , as a mere matter of form , would you mind telling us where you were on the evening of monday , july _num_ th ?
she cried herself to sleep every night , grew thin and pale , and at last became so ill that her aunt called in a doctor .
look after blackie nothing must happen to blackie look after her .
said battle hurriedly .
only the impression conveyed to the mind by the sensesand suppose theyre the wrong impressions ?
closing the door after her , he came back to the table .
knighton looked at him in some surprise .
five candles were lit and placed about the room .
leo went over and took up the receiver .
i often wonder why the whole world is so prone to generalize .
lydia flinched a little .
edward and i were his only relations .
you dont want technicalities , i know , so ill spare you them .
parker pyne : im awfully glad you turned up here , sirespecially for my mothers sake .
i could go to timbuctoo with the proper transport laid on .
the girl stammered .
alice , her name was , a little bit of a thingvery ingenuous .
thats nonsense , of course , said the other .
you complete devil .
beresfordyou see , i know all about youmrs .
val , and the master last .
hercule poirot said : we have separated the dual personality .
he ruminated for a minute or two .
that , said major despard grimly , seems to have been the only justification for the late mr .
anthony who finds things for me when i lose themand a lucky china pig ive gotand an awfully nice mixing bowl , blue inside and white out , that i used to make cakes in .
that even when a mans fair his hair looks dark because he plasters it down with stuff .
bill , be sensible and intelligent for a minute .
but surely you cant go now ?
i expect the letter is destroyed long ago after being put in as evidence at the inquest .
of course , the press does a lot to help them .
sadly we said farewell to our friendsor to the greater portion of them , for a quota was going to accompany us to sydney .
le docteur , are your patients managing to do without you for a little ?
now , the passengers .
he marched them into it and turned the key on them .
it was all automatic .
they referred to one particular inmate .
i cried , interested .
rather pretty really .
do you always travel first-class , mr .
in the drawing room .
tchuttchut said mr .
now , what time was it exactly when dr .
that i cant see ?
it was a fair and peaceful sight bathed in the autumn sunshine .
now , at last , she felt , she was free of the boyntons .
id trusted john .
he might perhaps live a little out of london and have a little car .
i had imagined putting out a hand , pulling a banana off the stem and eating it .
they found the vicar in his study .
all such nonsense , said mrs .
a startled look came into alfreds eyes .
if it is necessary , messieurs , she said quietly when he had finished , that is all there is to it .
well , its all of a piece , isnt it , with the other things ?
i ran across franklin just as he left the telephone .
always an awkward business , a poisoning case , said johnson .
grand , isnt it ?
she might have known something about his real mother or his real father , or something like that .
where were you before that ?
you have been loved by a brave mana hero .
even lately when he had been so difficult and nervywhen nothing seemed to please him .
youre an american , said miss hetherington , sharply , and with some venom in her voice .
pots the painter , mrs .
in the drawing room are patrick simmons , phillipa haymes , and either colonel easterbrook or edmund swettenhamwe dont know which .
we have heard the evidence of the passengers .
he had a cup of black coffee in his hand and was wearing a very smart dressing gown .
life here was sunshine , sea , and social pleasures .
later in the week he would suddenly push my sister into a shop , quickly order three pennyworth of a favourite sweet and then look at my sister , daring her not to pay .
dont you remember where you got it ?
they inherit under the present will , but i dont believe , somehow , that the money motive would be particularly strong in their case .
i dont know what ?
i can trust jacquelines taste .
i only know that im backback in the nightmare i know .
oliver , interpreting his look correctly .
some people like living that way , said evelyn .
it seemed possible that general ravenscroft had shot his wife and then himself , but apparently it was just as probable that lady ravenscroft had shot her husband and then herself .
absolute folly !
protection .
hilary suggested .
day after day , and how one longs for a good plate of meat and two vegetables .
put it that , later , leo argyle goes down to speak to her about jacko , or about something else .
gordon chetwynd looked towards colonel munro .
show me your left arm .
theres too much tendency to attribute to god the evils that man does of his own free will .
there was no other furniture in the room .
i thought of opening up monday week and am relying on you , so dont let me down , will you , old boy ?
for that reason men embezzlethey make fraudulent entries he waved his hands .
you would have done that ?
yet the possibility is there .
but nothing that you can say or anyone can say will bring philip back again .
he created the impression that captain trevelyan was deadgot everyone all worked up .
suddenly a quick suspicion darted into his mind .
you have , if i may make the criticism , rather too humorous a sense of the dramatic .
and nobody came to the flat that evening ?
with whipped cream on top ?
wotherspoon drew her own and mrs .
tommy made no reply .
john burnaby i charge you with the murder of joseph trevelyan on friday the _num_ th instant , and i hereby warn you that anything you may say will be taken down and may be used in evidence .
it is at your wild animal you look ?
greta ohlsson in one case and antonio foscarelli in the other both swear that miss debenham and the valet never left their compartments , hildegarde schmidt swears to the princess being in hers , and count andrenyi has told us that his wife took a sleeping draught .
but with eyes fixed on bunch , the man said in a weak voice , pleaseplease and then , with a slight tremor , he died .
the mans brow contracted .
you never know , mr .
do you really think - but it ' s impossible impossible .
poirot began with a mechanical expression of sympathy to which the girl acquiesced without any change of expression .
ive got to know !
i went on learning the rest of the beethoven sonata with madame legrand , who , though disappointed in me as a pupil who might have done her credit , was still kind and encouraging and said i had a proper sense of music .
woman found deadpistol in her handclear case of suicideshe locked herself in to do it .
it is , perhaps , only natural that there should be chit-chat , said miss marple with spirit , given the circumstances .
six months ago , a letter was suppressed .
renisenb asked her father where hori and yahmose were .
it is clear the boy has told all that he knowsand i do not think he is inventing .
its no good arguing about how it was done .
no , no , not dangerous ; say , a man who may be usefulin danger !
is her tale of the telephone true , or did she invent it ?
never a laugh !
you never saw him taking it or anything of that kind ?
the coincidence was too much for me .
and the ruby ?
unfortunately they do , sir , was the valets smooth reply .
but i know quite well from my own experience how much family trifles mean to one , especially as one is getting older .
she lost hole after hole .
bobby gave a gasp of acute disappointment .
it was a soft gasping soundholding in it the essence of feminine cupidity .
major metcalf was in the cellar .
it sounds so silly .
its a dreadful thinginsanity .
done , said stein with alacrity .
carton now proposed that i should make a bargain with anita grnberg , or nadina , as she now called herself .
that is all right , sir ; still three berths left .
i dont fly in the face of evidence .
finally , touched i think by my violent love for ashfield , mother gave in .
most of it is pulled down and rebuilt .
the special branch is on to it , too .
the sheet was clean because barbara hadnt written any letters that day .
there was sure to be someone whose name began with d not far off in the audience .
i wasnt thinking of it as a coincidence , said the other .
oh no thanks , no thanks !
the colonel snorted .
there are no men in this family !
listening , no doubt , to the opinions of his elders .
bolitho was away on a well-earned holiday .
of course it wasnt ellie !
hes got rooms in jermyn streetdo i mean jermyn street or the other one ?
there he drew a blank .
they turned and began retracing their steps .
but theres one thing that sticks out in a most incongruous way .
schwartz endeavoured to draw the tall , grey-haired man on the other side of the carriage into the conversation , but the latter merely stared at him coldly over his pince-nez and returned to the perusal of his book .
she asked you to get them for her ?
your brother is here ?
help me .
you refused because of your mother tommy flushed .
you were sighing so !
crozier noted her pallor .
it was exactly , you understand , like a stage scene .
the sordid crime took on a new aspect .
he strode along the street oblivious of the midday heat .
who was the only man who had an alibi during the darkness .
you understand , poirot , that it is no longer done .
so the will wasnt in mrs .
inspector hardcastle got up promptly .
easier said than done , said kelsey .
just a mite excited , arent you , gentleman joe ?
life is badly arranged .
miss griffith seems an eminently sane healthy-minded womanbut i say , i dont know .
this little fellow was fired from the mauser .
think ill walk , said ross .
the central figure with all eyes upon him .
ask anybody .
the fronts the other side , the side you saw from the bridge .
is it very bad ?
as he had suspecteddust !
but for them (and the tree !
he again reappeared and begged me to follow him .
dinner at eight oclock .
dont use that word .
she must have found out about them , said shaista .
rogers coughed .
your maid has been with you a long time , madame ?
and youre positively convinced now that ronald marsh is a white-headed boy who can do no wrong .
i didnt think it was my place to do so .
for instance , it was something that the murderer had not been able to take away with him at the time that he committed the crime .
firmly , my mother drew mlle mauhourat towards the door .
what is wrong with her brassire ?
and captain dacres , he too has not the clear conscience .
he wouldnt sign a certificate .
anything interesting , sheila ?
inspector slack looked contemptuous .
jason rudd nodded .
what might be true , pippa ?
it concealed moments when he found it difficult to avoid smiling .
oliver , if that means anything to you .
i dont know what she looked like ; how much louise might have changed .
i didnt think of it , said miss griffith , and added : he never seemed to me really ill not illbut what ?
you had lost something , perhaps , said poirot .
but i see now .
which made it a pretty clear case ?
she went to the wrong flat .
you are more like the snow queen though , when i come to think of it .
hes been preparing his crime for some time .
clarissa .
did mr clayton suspect ?
dead white and lots of mascara and the usual kind of limp hair hanging over her face .
they arent really new subjects .
she paid no attention to a faint murmur of sergeant lamb .
ill explain in a minute .
shove it in your pocket again .
he sprang up , the paper on which he had been writing in one hand , his pen in the other .
but it was not a dream !
the swing door into the hotel opened to let someone through , and a beam of light fell suddenly on the others face , illuminating its look of dull suffering , of uncomprehending dumb endurance .
now before the cabaret , can you remember who was sitting alone at any moment ?
they can all wait till the morning .
not only is he one of the kindest people i know he is a most remarkable and interesting character .
none of us you might say liked her .
i want you to help me personallyas a friend .
a year and three or four months .
poirot found himself appraising her carefully .
there is no possibilityand i repeat those words stronglythere is no possibility that jacko argyle killed his adopted mother that night .
next boy , said mrs .
barnes intently , poirot asked : what do you think has happened to his wife ?
then they came out again and walked towards the rivers edge .
i believe elderly people do get obsessions of that kind sometimes .
cant you stop bullying her ?
even more exciting than sarah bernhardt did i find rejane .
wade staggered .
yours truly , hugo cornworthy (secretary) p .
he thought for a moment , and then asked , did you all take coffee ?
so he was struck down by venus .
its going to be a tight fit .
are youis that m .
i remembered mrs .
i will make a prophecy , he said .
we were there in the same restaurant and actually at the same table where poor rosemary barton poisoned herself last year .
why couldnt he sing in tune ?
there was a slight buzz on his desk and he picked up the receiver once more .
but now , poirot , tell me , what am i to do about all thisjudith and allerton , i mean .
very sensible , said mr .
she took the diamonds to suggest a motive for the murder .
we will ask .
what possible connexion could he have with the affair ?
i looked in the register to see the name .
dusty cranesbell , for instance there was a house by a canal , said tuppence , refusing to be sidetracked into botany .
the first thing ive got to make you understand , said calgary , is why im still concerning myself over all this .
the investigation of purchases of a b c railway guides caused inconvenience and trouble to heaps of innocent people .
poirot indicated that he had .
some fizz is what we need .
there was malice in it , and a curious intimate knowledge .
the first thing i saw was you sitting there knitting and calling yourself mrs .
a very powerful impression .
it was artificial conversation , but it tided us over the first awkwardness .
' ' i mean about the robbery .
yes , lanscombe ?
do you honestly believe jim to be guilty , inspector narracott ?
he sounds all right , thought tommy .
he opened the front door , which was not locked , and the two men passed into the house .
i believe magdalene works quite hard politically for him .
he laughed , and the sound of his laugh hurt katherine .
he has been a most famous detective .
said clarissa , sounding startled .
the angle at which she was holding her mirror was such that it reflected the mirror of the hanging wardrobe in the room next to hers and in that mirror she saw a man doing something very curious .
silly name for a house , i think .
he took a final look at the body , exchanged a few brief words with the police surgeon and then crossed to the dining room where three people sat over empty teacups .
' sir george glanced up at the sky .
i think she went to be secretary to a veterinary surgeon .
audrey strange is fully aware of these facts ?
in pursuance of my investigations , i have come to ask you for certain information .
renisenb drew herself up .
she might have seen whoever it was she was waiting for from the window and gone out into the hall and let himor herin .
offend .
full opportunity .
which of those damned bitches is it ?
she had invented the whole story to ruin him .
de sousa .
i think you can .
it lowers the blood-pressure .
he took the way out that seemed best to him .
he added after a minute or two : im even sorry for protheroe .
was he looking for the girl ?
she never takes any remedies herself .
i always like to hear suggestions .
hilary said passionately : we must get out of here .
said isaac .
rafiel ignored this last point .
she hated to leave me in all this confusion and unhappiness , but it was one of those priorities that cannot be evaded .
im so stupid , david .
difficult for me , you knowdifficult for a man whos an old buffer like meto know what a girl wantsat leasti mean to know what a girl ought to have .
chantry .
leaving her slightly comforted he followed iris who led him across the hall and into a small room giving out on the back of the house where a melancholy plane tree was shedding its last leaves .
his glance , challenging and accusing , swept round the table .
thank you , he said .
i rather believe in them myself .
that same person left her footprints in the flower bed and her fingerprints on the outside of the window .
llewellyn-smythe left a large sum of money to the girl .
the same loan , on the same conditions , that you offered to prince michael .
and the nurses , what did they say ?
i couldnt sleep , i said shortly .
all the same m .
he had qualified as a doctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine , and lived at home while pursuing literary ambitions ; though his verses never had any marked success .
the sequence , if i may put it that way , seems perfectly clear .
you thought it was mr trefusis because of the way he held the paper knife earlier ?
one by one the drawers yielded to his manipulations .
the other typists collaborated in this sentiment by ejaculating : youre for it , jones , and on the mat , jonesey .
you ought to have the snapdragon in the library , its much the darkest room .
i couldnt bear another moment of it !
i dont fancy shes ever been alone in the house .
least of all did i want plain boiled macaroni .
iris had gone up there one day after an unsuccessful hunt for an old red pullover for which she had an affection .
and you , mademoiselle ?
then she said : noi am surethere is no one .
clayton had been sitting in a chair by the window .
i suppose , really , that im better , she admitted , but i feel so terribly depressed .
it is just an idea of mine , explained lawrence .
hes equally pleasant to both of us .
this stuff makes the hair fall out , she went on .
we are still deserted , mr .
hes about a hundred , but pretty reliable , i think .
laurier ?
conjugal what nots , you know what i mean .
that is the procedure .
why should burglars take a man in armour to pieces ?
hed have had to twist his hand right round his head .
he posted a box of chocolates to a woman he had never seen and of whom he knew nothing .
theyre betrayed and deserted and pushed aside .
oh , no , he is dead all right .
oh , i know what you meant .
robin and mrs .
macbeth having been a success with mathew , we proceeded to the merry wives of windsor .
id better go and see mitzi now .
the others crowded in .
lucy , drat her , hadnt considered that angle .
armstrong was startled .
' ' what time was that ?
the next fact is the answer to our usual question .
but robert says shes far and away the best nurse weve had .
he didnt show any wish for a business conference with mr .
said despard .
poirots first proceeding was to interview the matron .
nothing doing ?
nasty business , very nasty business .
its a regular trap .
twenty minutes past one only .
these scientists , these biologists , these research chemists , they are not interesting .
he paused , then said , remind me to make a note about that and get siddely on to it .
if i were a clever chap i might be able to hit upon something that might be a clue .
he was the worst servant we ever had .
not even a cat could have gained access that way .
besides , she is , as they say , not quite so young as she once was .
yes , thats what the family call her .
she looked at him doubtfully , with slight annoyance .
the sad thing is that i never met him .
dont you read the times ?
the tops of things are always nice and shiny and smooth .
all the police surgeon will say definitely is that she was probably dead by half past nine .
some time in august a telegram took my mother away from home .
immediately poirot was galvanized into energy .
i wonder if gladys got to see him or not , she added thoughtfully .
hush , my dear , said philip .
i still feel that he hasnt really any proper moral sense .
clearly she had plenty of money .
oh , no , sir , he lost his temper easilyas i say , it just depended what had happened to upset him .
a tool in the hands of an unscrupulous woman .
not that i ever thought at the timewell , of course , then i didnt know what had happened .
did she see your point ?
one thing weve got to admitthe fair mabelle put it over on both of us , good and proper .
bill had recovered his equilibrium now and quite enjoyed doing showman .
she thought : it might have been yesterday .
what was it the old man on the quay had said ?
nevertheless , malicious though henet was , she had delivered the message faithfully .
but that is not right .
but you see , weve got to account for the thing somehow .
yahmose , my unhappy , tormented friend , was very dear to me .
richard and victoria got into the car again and the men trudged away into the desert .
but you yourself think well , i always try to keep an open mind , but one does wonder , you know .
mary said sharply : id rather not know who did it .
penrose said , giles .
and you think youll find him in this house ?
ever seen this before , mr .
tell em their birds heresafe under lock and key .
your mother , said tina .
i was thinking of changing my job .
the elder woman replied : no , you do it , dear .
a hurried departure was made forthwith .
the sight of me , however , did not fill her with any alarm whatever .
i have thought of that , and that you see is where i come in .
and the damage had been something quite easily done , occupying very little time .
but you knew about it .
i would not presume to give you advice , you know .
he sat down again and asked : have a drink , entwhistle ?
ive got to go on with this , said luke to himself .
nothing anyone can do .
poirot said : no .
you said youd heard of hollowquay .
you dont think it was an inside job , sir ?
elsewhere , i have described hercule poirot .
i must have brought the ether with me .
i thought i recognized that muscular knock .
she died a year later .
hard timeshard times nowadays , said mr .
declares one of the waiters was the worse for liquor , and that he was giving him a dressing down .
no , im just hunting around for somethingwell , something out of the ordinary .
do come in and sit down .
it may sound silly to you but i the bus had stopped .
she wondered how much aunt kathie knew or guessed .
name of mary jordan , that was right ?
and it takes more than one man and a revolver to hold up mr .
but surely i could walk round museums as well as anyone , and probably with more interest and intelligence than a younger woman .
he hoped he had done right , but it was a difficult thing to know what to do when one was as much in the dark as he was .
drink some more tea .
ill bear that in mind , sir , said detective-inspector craddock in his most formal manner , and nobody would have guessed that dermot eric craddock was actually sir henrys godson and was on easy and intimate terms with his godfather .
come into my room , mr .
i thought it was too good to be true .
oh , were both delighted , im sure , said mrs .
i thought , perhaps , you might be going to be married .
yesyesi see he asked sharply : was that why you alluded to dolly bantry as poor dear at the beginning of our conversation ?
jeremy looked puzzled .
physically im strong .
miss sutcliffe likes it , too .
liked a bit of crime , lily did .
calthrop , who this woman is ?
what about young manders ?
i do not even know if your brother edmund told you that we were married .
she was devoted to the man .
ah , said archdeacon simmons , with appreciation , one of your excellent veal cutlets !
she knows im happy .
as before , there are no fingerprints on the handle of the dagger .
as regards young marston i dont think theres anything to be done .
shes looking for a house , you say ?
the beady eyes were on me , watching .
whod benefit financially by your wifes death ?
did you ever see her sunday comet ?
there was no question as to his guilt .
how did you come to have such an interest in the subject ?
and nice to see you , said audrey .
it was to be soon after christmasthe weekend of the _num_ th he stopped .
it wasnt the right kind .
and yetit is curious what is curious ?
they come upon you theres no knowing when or how .
was it you , mr .
boyd carrington ?
and i rather fancy some accident would have happened to both of you .
it was lady angkatells sweetness which hercule poirot was considering at this moment .
he set to work to examine his prison .
our police force is in many ways very wonderful .
an elderly woman told to be careful , not to run up and down stairs , not to do any intensive gardening , and so on and so on .
he said : afternoon , mrs .
it was then , just as i sent her away , that i saw lady julia coming up the stairs .
strange alteration of moods in sir gervase chevenix-gore !
lily gamboll had picked up the meat chopper which was lying conveniently on the table and had aimed a blow at her aunt with it .
poirot , to do a thing supremely well is a justification !
she hurried out plus one unwanted lipstick in her bag , and drove her car down the main street of chipping bartram and turned , after passing a garage and a hospital building , down a rather narrow road which had quite pleasant small houses on either side of it .
it cant be , man , he murmured .
i had a little money of my own .
probably the cradle of an aristocratic family .
mrs acton , a forceful lady , acted as matron , since she was senior officer of the v .
a return to the inn , and a night of horror upon one of your english provincial beds , mon ami .
he specializes in thefts from museums of objets dart and such like .
yes , he said , it alters the position , does it not ?
he rose , stretched himself .
he strode briskly down the lane and beat a firm rat-tat on the knocker of no .
thompsonthompson .
how many windows were there in her bedroom ?
it had been easy for me to suppress this until i had a lethal amount in my possession .
superintendent battle said , if you please at the same moment that bill said , not if you dont feel up to it .
welmans husbands nephew .
the presence of her husband seemed to make mrs .
you are miss barnard ?
you had written to her .
dated september _num_ .
something which makes me doubt if what you say can be true .
hmim not sure youre wrong .
perhaps all three of them knew .
after all , ridiculous as ruperts assumption had seemed at the time , that single letter with its power of attorney coming from east africa waswell , open to suspicion .
the inspectors compliments , and hed be glad to have a word with youif you feels up to it , that is , hoskins hastened to add ; noting , as hercule poirot had done , the effects of shock .
to that i agreed .
in the seat immediately behind mine , leaning forward with her lips slightly parted , was the subject of the present imitationlady edgware , better known as jane wilkinson .
i have her address , said poirot .
what do you mean , youve seen her already ?
the rhoda girl did .
hes attractive .
he seemed , too , to have been a solitary type .
they are all highly coloured .
through henets pretended devotion , the venom began to show clearly .
he asked for dr bryant .
it is a pretty alibi you have there .
poirot nodded with great gusto .
theo looked up at it , as she stood on the doorstep some three hours later .
please , please , please .
they were pious , but had , unfortunately , no sense of the artistic .
james was seeking to gain time .
and supposing , my friend , that your guess happens to be wrong ?
only she doesnt want him to get hold of it .
i was a fool , said lenox ; i thought she really cared for knighton .
he had seen so far , four pictures of amyas crales : two at the tate , one at a london dealers , one , the still life of roses .
she got herself killed .
for , you see , to take a concentrated solution of digitalisthat , yes , it is a clever idea , because mrs boynton was already taking the drug .
church knew .
perry went towards the fireplace .
he knows exactly where miss brent was two years ago for her holiday and the kind of people she met there .
such a pretty girl and enjoyed life so much .
they dont like servantsor rather clemency doesnt .
yes , it is as bad as that .
chapter _num_ in another minute the girl had reached them .
i dont know if we can arrange a meeting , perhaps in town one day ?
since then i havent been able to get it out again .
almost .
ive tried to think of everything .
she spoke quickly and convincingly .
i found a letter among his papers and i destroyed it .
i have made coffee for you in here .
im sorry i cant leave here and come with you , but i dont thinkwell , it wouldnt be viewed very well .
lets ask him , said frankie .
the anger went out of his face .
like tortoises , you know , they draw their heads in and hope nobody will notice them .
on the other side was jeremy cloades house .
so she mightjust possibly she might have taken sittaford house just on purpose to get acquainted with captain trevelyan .
when the gates clanged behind us today as we came in it was a horrible feeling .
it is a beautiful thing , said mr .
i couldnt say it wasnt him !
gilroy .
good morning , george , she said sweetly .
everywhere silence , and shuttered windows .
eighteen when victoria regained consciousness , it was with a sense of an immense passage of time .
leidner to silence her before she could give him away .
good , my friend , said poirot .
that is the english point of view .
afterwards , i would suggest that you take a little trip abroad .
we all do these things when we are young , said poirot , smiling .
but go on , m .
you hoped that it would arouse my interestthat i should occupy myself with the affair .
the mere sight of such radiant vitality warmed mr .
the superintendent came over to them .
the steel bands were one of the main attractions of the islands .
funny bloke , i says .
cornworthy shook his head .
the ambassador was a shrewd , middle-aged man with keen blue eyes .
english peeress .
she certainly wont want to see me again .
as he finished drinking , he said : it was not pretty , that !
let me put forward a solution , sir .
between two puffs of cigarette smoke she said very quietly and evenly : tell me how to break that will .
he said unexpectedly : yes , it was on the monday .
a faint smile passed over the austere features .
but notwithstanding his horror and remorse , he still felt himself incapable of giving up elsa .
so now , said poirot , there are no more folliats at nasse .
but i will now spell it as it was actually written .
starkwedder retorted .
two separate staircases led to the floors above which remained detached .
then his face changed , and with a long convulsive shudder he fell forward in a crumpled heap , whilst an odour of bitter almonds filled the air .
ferguson , read mrs .
i waited a while , but the whole place was as still as the grave , so i made up my mind that i had made a mistake , and that what i had heard was a stray poacherquite natural conclusion to come to under the circumstances , i think .
that woman .
for , of course , that is just about the time when morley was killed .
i shouldnt have said so , sir .
envelope postmarked yesterday evening e .
alistair blunt frowned in an effort of memory .
you consider him a rich man , doctor ?
presently we heard a chink in the outer hall , and parker appeared in the doorway carrying a tray with a siphon , a decanter of whisky , and two glasses on it .
that could only be cosily brought out in a tte--tte between two women .
gardner came in .
quite so , said the inspector hastily .
everyone would be looking at her .
when she came back rhoda was staring out of the window and whistling .
i only know the one that richard coeur de lion went to .
a look of enlightenment came into the older doctors face .
moreover , judge for yourselfwhy should i wish to do her harm ?
apparently roberts managed to calm down the irate gentleman temporarilyand he died of anthrax almost immediately afterwards .
gossip ?
where have you been during what it is too short to call time ?
will miss daphne theodofanous , passenger to geneva , kindly come to the flight desk .
id have taken sixtybut dont tell him so !
the passage then turns sharply to the right again and the first door round the corner is the door into mrs .
he looked up and said : dont you want to help the innocent , mary ?
we parted almost immediately .
it was after that that his mind began to give wayfrom then on evil possessed him utterly .
my dear inspector neele , this is the perfect racket .
i bet they didnt .
that job you were offered .
yes , as you say , it is extremely annoying not to be able to get any word through , either by telephone or telegraph .
he treated his wife badly , ran after other women , and neglected her .
i ought to put my husband first .
the ginger beer and the beer ?
i will start again .
sarah said : shall we go , too , desmond ?
why should i hate it ?
hercule poirot said : you surpass yourself , georges .
he may even have thought his food was being tampered with ?
im really very inexperienced , you know .
halliday looked at him with an indescribable expression .
cant abear a dog , tramps cant .
im hiring you to investigate a case of murder .
he must have blenched a little at the sight of twelve nubile girls looking at him with interest , approbation , and possible romance in their eyes .
i have , i think , provided against every contingency .
eh bien , on one part , ce monsieur is lying .
and when he came to see her in london she said the same .
better say who you think it is , james .
go nowand be obedient to what you have been told .
you must know what you mean .
i must see you .
in any case , i think you know all there is to know .
mary sounded both shocked and hurt .
you gave too much rein to your imagination .
chopping and changing from one thing to the other .
good evening , gentlemen , he greeted us .
chapman ?
when i looked at myself in the glass half an hour afterwards , i was amazed .
it wasnt what i should have thought it to be .
she caught her breath .
regents park .
if i were to take counsels opinion , i am sure that he would say it constituted a genuine proposal .
his tone was polite but not enthusiastic .
a crowded main thoroughfare thronged with people , cars hooting violently , people shouting , european goods for sale in the shop windows , hearty spitting all round her with prodigious throat clearing as a preliminary .
good old sentimentality to the fore again , thought luke .
i recalled the curious tone in which dr .
they came out of the temple into the sunshine with the sand yellow and warm about their feet .
remainsto make money !
it is in the end monotonous .
he greeted victoria with a warm smile and an outstretched hand .
it was like destroying your flesh and blood .
something that no friends of theirs in england , perhaps , would have known about .
easiest thing in the world to put the stuff in as soon as the lights were lowered and general attention went to the raised stage .
they are geniuses perhaps at what they do , but they are uninteresting people with whom to converse .
i dont know how to dance the lancers , mrs wordsworth .
then raynor spoke .
with a certain natural craftiness i managed nearly always to play the bass side of the duet .
returning to her main theme , she continued , but that mrs elgin actually had the nerve to tell me that it was such a poor specimen she wasnt going to cook it .
he found the cinema in lion road easily enough , and , shown a photograph of romaine heilger , the commissionaire recognized her at once .
i met him for the first time on this journey .
the comte was surprised .
poison !
here reposes the perfect gooseberry , she remarked .
' ' and this miss collins , how long has she been with you ?
poirot sat back on his heels .
either on foot or in a car .
he rubbed his nose again .
hell have to be pensioned off , i suppose ?
onlythose two fitted .
in any case i dont see that theres anything that can possibly be done .
no , said his wife .
always insisted on my sticking to the old-fashioned tablecloths .
ramsay is abroad a good deal i understand .
but complexvery complex .
damn all !
also , your reasoning is false .
you had , also , i believe , a disappearance here of a foreign girl .
jeffersons also , but thats not nearly so certain .
the cottage chanced to be vacant , and she took it for six months .
you are my eyes and ears .
and since you havent had a wife in evidence for the last fifteen years or sono ones likely to spot that im not her .
he was very fond of her , you know , and i dont think he ever got over her death .
we had a short conversation with the police inspector in charge of the case before leaving .
two hundred thousand pounds , no less .
mused miss knight .
it came to him from nowhere at all , out of the blue .
he made a graceful gesture towards the company .
true .
im sorry , very sorry .
there are no fingerprints on the letters and envelopes of a distinctive character .
codes , responses , various properties .
my sister said , perhaps shes frightened at riding on the horse .
lynn took the bills and glanced through them .
oh , yes , quite unimaginative .
rosaleen was surely strangely simple .
she knelt down and stared where he pointed .
tell me , miss march , you have brought this paper with you ?
very welltomorrow morning (she depressed it) as soon as possible .
he paused , and asked : want me any longer ?
miss wetherby gave a little scream .
as an instance i said to you that the dead man was all wrong .
i knew it had been a murder i had seen and it had been a dead body they were carrying away to hide somewhere .
miss horsefall grinned .
but there must be a catch somewhere .
they are so often , you see , not expected to be where they are .
itll be better soon , said the nurse .
but he had thought then that it was an impertinencea joke .
kirsten lindstrom said , not without dignity : i think , micky , that you should hold your tongue .
knighton made a deprecating gesture .
its deceptive , youll find , sir .
far more likely to be an accident , i agree .
cut out the compliments , said tuppence .
my clue cannot be wrong ; and yet you wouldnt like to tell me what it is ?
maybe she got all right again .
he had been unimpressed by the plight of mrs arbuthnot , who , having first tried to fight against the order , was now pleading for time to confer with the ministry of health as to where to move her nursery .
edward ferrier took a deep breath .
she murmured : im sorry if im spoiling sport in any way , but really , you know , there isnt any such person !
i , too , am interested in that young man .
i dont think , really , that one ever would .
to a major somervell .
he had several , but they are all dead .
in case you should be foolish enough to think of calling for help , he explained suavely .
hes one of the richest men in englandbut does that satisfy him ?
renisenb pressed forward , intoxicated with the general excitement .
he heard a faint sigh , the scrape of a chair on the floor to his right , but he did not look round .
it wouldnt have been , ten years ago .
afterwards when you are married , monsieur , she said pleadingly , it will not continueall this ?
you will be interested .
mademoiselle , you have always seemed to me the pattern of efficiency .
shall i tell you what i think , gerald ?
if there was anyone else in the house , anyone else at the time , the police , my friends that is to say , who have known the investigation at the time , say that nothing told was really compatible with anything else but with the facts .
that must have been what old miss marple was hinting at yesterday .
he said fiercely : no you dont .
many long years , we hope , said yahmose .
scratchy pen she always used , she wouldnt use biros or anything like that .
hes going to take us up to the place of sacrificewhatever that is .
you wrote it , put it in an envelope , sealed it , stamped it and put it in the boxcomme a ?
he walked on until he saw the big painted hatchment over the doorway and the legend : british consulate .
formidable !
raoul , think of it !
i hope youll find everything comfortable .
so now rowena knew , or thought she knew , who it had been in the wood that day .
well play one hand .
loraine nodded .
they loved each other so much , and loved poor , unhappy , hating dolly .
you couldnt hear anyone sneezing in the study from your gate , i said .
the girl spoke wearily .
colonel bantry stared .
her expression did not change .
to begin with , i should like a plan of the istanbul-calais coach , with a note of the people who occupied the several compartments , and i should also like to see their passports and their tickets .
accordingly , i left the beach , and walked inland .
were off the main road , you see .
poirot said : possibly a green calendarwith tear-off leaves .
third girl _num_ .
yes , messieurs ?
miss marple looked interested .
always , since my father married her , i and my brothers have loved her very much .
you are at least frank , mademoiselle .
she had long straggly hair which when caught by the wind , flew out behind her .
oh , of course ; well , we all use them , i suppose .
a man whos travelled in the part of the world this thing comes from ?
where to search ?
a girl who is attacked , a school child who is assaultedyes , every day .
an example must be made and he looked at me questioningly .
she went back across the room and out into the front hall and then round the angle of the drawing room wall and so along to the dining room .
there was abdominal painsickness .
and lady angkatell finished up by giving the inspector a beaming smile .
it is not sporting !
do you know what i think , mademoiselle ?
i felt it my duty to enter one last protest .
you dont know ?
her voice was wonderfully exciting , warm , exhilarating , intoxicating .
thats the difficulty , of course , luke admitted .
mary mounted the stairs , her hands held high .
well , he had a good lot of money in his bank account .
if the alternative theory suggested by the defence is possible and consistent with the evidence , the accused must be acquitted .
her other clothes seem mainly of foreign manufacture mostly purchased in paris .
and so gladys was strangled and a clothes-peg clipped on her nose , murmured miss marple to herself .
probably the kind of man one reads about in the paper , who operates on wall streetor is it in wall street ?
or the headwaiter ?
i dont believe any of the papers even tipped it as an outside chance .
her crowd had been so gayso cynical .
i dont supposei mean , its something perhaps i oughtnt to bother you about .
unfortunate , said mosgorovsky .
do you still think she did it ?
she was very , queer ; i couldnt make her out .
brandy bottles , eh ?
she had outside friends to dinner here sometimes .
the bowl must be inscribed and the preparations made for the necessary rites .
coming out into the limelight , too , in his old age .
wheres your yacht ?
lord horbury looked up at her with admiration , fondness and a queer sense of homecoming .
they all went into the house .
you must at least dance with each of those young men twiceprobably , you will go to supper with one of them , unless he or you particularly wish to avoid that .
and i have married you !
he was a fine-looking man in spite of his bald head and advancing years .
then he picked them up and returned them to his case , which he replaced in his pocket .
some good music nacora , the pianist , and katherine bird , the australian contralto in the big studio .
and all those different parties .
picturesqueand usually so very unexpected .
when she went down with flu , i mean .
oh , but surely , mrs .
there was something about him of the eighteenth-century buck .
refuses to look after children .
even that last picture of tommy , revolver in hand , failed to comfort her .
she murmured as she turned its pages .
he stooped also to the shelf .
ill go and bring miss okeefe to you .
he seemed hardly to remember who you were .
how did i get into this place ?
a weekeh ?
awfully pretty way she had with hersaucy , you know , plenty of backchat .
dont you want to know why i did come ?
she turned her head and looked at him inquiringly .
pauncefoot jones might be , she had circumvented catherine and the olive branch and dr .
but how do you propose to set about it ?
that is true , said cosden .
really , you know , i have not very much to live for , m .
you might just take a look in the desk in the dining room .
no dilly-dallying about .
then i swung the chair round , smashed the mirror , and , after scrawling sorry on a piece of paper , i went out through the window and shut it the way m .
the most peculiar clothes and lashings and lashings of jet well , i think it ought to be stopped , said george .
said katharine , looking surprised .
and there she was , established for life !
theres not sufficient evidence to warrant an extradition order , then ?
he is within .
very attractive .
we all hoped , you see , as how the place would be kept on by the family .
he might get some help from the girls there .
given in such quantity the drug would act quickly and suddenly .
and it may be that you knew nothing about how nofret came to her death .
in poor little josephine all the worst of the family came together .
i came here originally to solve a riddle .
the end of them near the nose went up and the opposite end of the cheek went down for an almost astonishing extent .
i cant tell you , m .
simeon lee , who was successful with women and who broke his wifes heart !
chimneys _num_ : _num_ thursdaysounds like an appointment .
yes , i suppose i shall .
my fourth question concerns those pince-nez .
hes too slick for that .
one sees so much of that sort of thing abroad .
entwhistle raised his eyebrows in well-simulated surprise .
but you did not actually tell him so ?
the superintendents french accent was not as good as sergeant graves , but he was proud of it .
i should perhaps explain , said dr .
little mr satterthwaite , who was , as you might say , mr quins emissary , also became a favourite character of mine .
people certainly when they travelled abroad usually had a wig or two wigs .
she said robustly : well , after all , what of it ?
the examination was quickly over .
the stranger stood there in the open doorway , shaking off snow , a strange man , walking into the empty house .
hes buried here .
inspector last is coming over here tomorrow morning .
and what would she be doing in the folly ?
collectively they reacted as guilty parties .
how is your little edna shaping ?
what did he look like ?
it drew into the kerb .
i cant think why sailing bores you so much .
im going away .
yes , said huish , yes , we were wrong .
mary has never given satisfaction to me .
but , i did find something .
he wouldnt let me touch them .
ive no doubt there was a barrier between them .
you mean theres a general kind of discontentupset ?
veronica cray went on without waiting for further questioning : john saw me home .
want my help ?
the house was put up for sale .
i regret to admit it , but it was an error of judgement on my part .
no , tim had met her .
does anyone pass the doorthink ?
and i want to feel , too , that you are safe .
archdeacon simmons would know what to do .
i may come round , then , to hickory road ?
mr ankatell did not contain himself to the twenty miles an hour that was the usual safe speedi believe we went forty or fifty m .
we went into another room where other people were asleep , and so on , until we heard two men talking .
not so very tall .
you could go out and solve this case magnificently if you only would .
the latter hesitated , glanced at superintendent hayes , then at poirot , and finally , as though receiving sanction , he said : thats right .
to startle him at a moment when he must act quickly or not at all .
we went down together to chinatown and searched the house from which i had been rescued .
she was staying at the tio hotel , which was , she was fairly sure , not at all inexpensive .
the window was open and she listened .
cast your mind back to the fatal evening , madame .
i think i can say we are a little further on , mr .
so we parted in angerand nowhes dead .
they are now repairing the damage .
i shall never forget it .
' i see what you mean , ' said japp rising .
there was no gas laid on .
that you ridgeway ?
perhaps thats why marina gregg has bought gossington hall .
beside miss bulstrode sat inspector kelsey and beyond him , hercule poirot .
he went on his way to the tennis court .
you never come here and yet you dont want to sell it ?
after all , we dont know that shes dead .
your moustache , m .
youre happy there ?
he was unimpressed by the remark .
i put on nortons dressing gown , ruffled up my grey hair on end , and came down the passage and rapped on your door .
hercule poirot sat up in bed .
wed have been happy on the island .
there was no answeronly the sound of someone breathing rather quickly .
i do not like a lawyer .
that was what puzzled and worried helen abernethie at the moment when you made your famous insinuation .
as the door opened , a white body precipitated itself upon the girlan aged wire-haired terrier very shaggy as to coat and suspiciously bleary as to eyes .
how well they look together , said mary , watching the retreating pair .
satterthwaite , it is a great many years since we met .
would anyone have believed seventy years ago that a person could hear big ben strike twelve on a little box and , after it had finished striking , hear it again with his own ears through the window , from the actual clock itselfand no jiggery pokery .
i trembled .
i should like everyone to assemble in sir gervases study at ten oclock .
i know how a newly made widow should behave .
i wonder now she went to the telephone .
sir henry clithering and his godson (now at scotland yard , i believe) , who was so very nice in the little paddocks case .
as the train drew out of the station poirot and i hurried along the corridor and tapped on the door of the inspectors sleeper .
hesoh , simply idiotic .
its so difficult to explain .
got him , boys .
her heart ?
there is the theory that mary gerrard committed suicide , but the only evidence in support of that theory is the fact that mary gerrard made a will shortly before she died .
you are going to make another of these famous guesses of yours ?
madame giselle had her own intelligence serviceit was her custom before lending money (that is , in the case of a large sum) to collect as many facts as possible about the client in question ; and her intelligence system , i may say , was an extraordinarily good one .
julius flung her a grateful glance , and jane came forward shyly to the allotted seat .
or had she deliberately withheld her name and given me the wrong address ?
how would it be if we each took one .
my views about mr .
i thought shed turn up all rightand i was going to give her a good dressing down when she did !
pc good , remaining behind , put on the gratified expression of a junior member of the force who has shown intelligence and hopes that it will count in his favour .
and i can put a steak under the grill or open a tin of soup .
but madame did not shrink .
there are times when i suspect myself of having changed over to the other side , and then having changed back again to this one !
youd better be careful , said frankie .
he had just completed their arrangement to his satisfaction when the lift came down again and the page boy emerged from the back of the hall whistling discordantly .
but which way did this man go ?
one of them looked like a big metallic centipede .
she leaned back in her chair .
fancying that the other man had noticed his surreptitious glance , he hastened once more into speech .
not last nightno .
he swung round on his heel and left them together .
an unfortunate accident , that .
he wheeled and went into the observation saloon .
a heavenly place for sacrifices , said carol with enthusiasm .
she looked round the room frowning .
leonides , said the inspector and went out .
of all the things to sayso prim and smug , too !
major riddle said : i hope you wont mind , colonel bury , if i ask you a somewhat personal question .
if i were to give a name to this place i should call it the country of giant children .
i have certain somewhat delicate negotiations to carry out .
i have been informed by inspector kelsey of several facts .
sacr tonnerre !
yes , she did , tim agreed .
i mean , really , said tommy , who was now completely swamped in a cloud of guilt for having disturbed a very important man , i mean , im not just trying to find out things .
im sorry not to have finished mrs .
she twiddled her fingers , said miss pierce suddenly .
though unacquainted with lord byrons famous poem , i never loved a dear gazelle , etc .
blatt restarted the engine which had stopped owing to the suddenness with which he had previously pulled up .
a man who is a child is the most frightening thing in the world .
i dont see why we shouldnt go on that trip with shirty if you really want to so much .
poirot said : he is a man who collects secretsand uses them to his advantage .
first , i suppose , gain .
i gather cora was always a fool .
shes a smart woman , and she might have noticed something that would set us on the track .
poirot paid no attention to me .
any children ?
my entrance did not wake him .
just splashing a few colours about on the canvasno constructionno careful drawing .
hamilton clipp , the latter talking nineteen to the dozen on every subject under the sun .
calgary sounded incredulous .
the trouble with a catarrhal cold is that it is hard to glean the proper amount of sympathetic consideration from ones friends .
he always puts them away for a rainy day .
and there she wasdead .
i musnt be crossed .
inspector neele did not reply .
actually he was merely comfortably off we did not have a butler or a footman .
miss marple gave a shrill exclamation of recognition .
oh , sir william , she exclaimed .
im not quite a conjurer , you know .
she took up once more her restless , almost aimless prowl round the room .
once or twice ive seen her looking at youi dont know what is going on in her mind but something isshes the kind that doesnt let anyone know what theyre thinking .
is that where you are speaking from ?
morning , evening , indoors , out of doors , at home or away from home ?
we held an exhaustive survey of the situation on the first evening out .
he thinks youre just a very nice , elderly lady who was at school with his wife .
do you remember the affair of the armstrong kidnapping , mrs .
castle produced a second list .
five months , monsieur .
there was nothing else helpful .
the police were , as usual , blamed for their supinenessmost unjustly , as time was to show .
race said : doyles got to know .
it is not true that i have done anything i should not do .
jolly roger hotel , smugglers island .
here was loneliness , emptiness , spaciousnessin fact , peace only , of course , one wasnt alone to enjoy it .
poirot attacked the omelette .
if you dont want gipsys acre , ellie , well buy a house somewhere else .
i will put it plainer .
she stood over mrs .
miss marple thought that as the secretary of a big financier miss blacklock might be presumed to know the world too .
that which he has , he hands onto those who come after him .
wades file towards him , wrote across it : failureowing to natural causes .
we arrive at charlock bay about four oclock , and the coach starts back at five , arriving here at ten oclock .
theyre very high strung , all these actors and actresses .
she wondered , as she had wondered before , if carrie louise deliberately turned her back on reality .
joking apart , i think youve made a very important discovery .
i intended to write from london andand makesome arrangement .
you found no clue of any kind that has not been reported ?
van aldin was impressed .
five instructions from beyond i it was some three or four days later that a communication arrived by the second post .
it was annoying , to say the least of it , if solly did not come this evening .
she cried out : you have no business to say that !
or perhaps its cambridge she lives in , or oxfordi think shes got a degree and either lectures here or teaches somewhere , or does something like that .
who say ?
it all fits in , said luke .
and what time would that be ?
and who was acquainted with the real reason of prince michaels being here ?
she put both hands to her face as though to hide it from view .
oh , they do not show themselves clearly , but they are there !
yes , thats exactly what i am doing .
i am sorry , she said .
it was rather worrying because i wasnt sure which was the best way to take it .
i never gave her a kind word , or a loving look .
yes , and something unpleasant had happenedsomething that was lying now upon midges heart and spirits like a thick black cloud .
not likely to trouble members of my profession .
on the other hand , she is not one to submit tamely to attempted murder !
alice chatterton is so kind , she said .
i suppose things are bound to change , said gwenda .
apparently he had been asked to accompany one of the girls to a dance some little distance away to which the others had not been invited .
yes , hastings , this very hat .
you neednt be frightened .
you dont take too many , i hope , i said .
i like your simple , practical mind , mirelle , but i am afraid what you desire wont come to pass .
strange was then with lady tressilian ?
there was a pause , then sir thomas legge said : and isaac morris is dead , you say ?
stonei wonder if it was done thenlegerdemain , dont they call it ?
you are very sensible .
she herself was busy with a gardening basket and gardening gloves .
do you remember , giles ?
youre capable of going on for hours on the subject and its really very boring to other people .
i mean , anyone could have strolled in there quite casually and come across it without having followed a single clue .
oh , shes gone to get her hair done .
it is not merely to pass the time of day with an old comrade ?
your daughter dislikes her stepmother .
on the other hand , if the murders stopped without reason , a suspicion of the truth might come to someone .
oh , no , the girl protested .
leidner and i had seen the man standing .
how did they die ?
ernestine grant has her points .
(extremely humiliating to my sister madge , who minded a good deal about her complexion at this period of her life .
never mind about hester and her boy friend .
rather grim , said frankie with that immediate understanding that bobbys father had lacked .
what do you meanwhy you ?
mon dieu , voil la clef !
there are people , you know , whowho agree with howard up to a point .
at any childrens parties of any size that i have gone to , i have come to the conclusion that at least a third of the children are not really enjoying themselves .
ii you recognize this , sir henry ?
the first youve had from her ?
farley shivered .
you know you can say anything you like to me .
at the station they were positive he had not departed by any train .
i wouldnt mind going to him and telling him everything .
she looked up at the broken mirror , shivered , and pulled her chair a little way round .
and then came the second occasion .
i wanted to stress urgency .
this benvoleo of yoursnow ive made it sound like a patent cleaneris going to make people benevolent and ill admit perhaps that its going to make them condescending , smug and pleased with themselves , but theres just a chance , too , that if you change peoples natures by force and they have to go on using that particular kind of nature until they die , one or two of themnot manymight discover that they had a natural vocation , in humility , not pride , for what they were being forced to do .
you went there a second time , you said ?
japp said : and you didnt see mr .
he left _num_ to each of his nieces and nephew , and the residue of his vast property outright to eurydice spragg in gratitude and admiration .
in the wastepaper basket .
oh no , that was just an appeal .
i know now what was wrong .
mademoiselle penn the effect is charming .
we both ran to the gun room door , but it was locked and we had to go round to the window .
unscrupulous !
hell see all the others , though , leach remarked .
it might have been one of the houseboys or a member of the expedition ?
i seem to see a patterna purposeful design .
good evening , lord altamount .
id just say goodnight , ask if there was anything i could do and come away .
after him came viscount tamplin , who had placed rosalie securely on those heights where she wished to tread .
time , _num_ : _num_ a .
beliefs in honesty , in fair trading .
she says that to meme , a mistress in the school !
satterthwaite , slightly startled .
you are thinking about me , those eyes said .
could it be the voice of miss sainsbury seale ?
his face was turned towards her , eager , adoring , a little humble .
its a very delicate affair , and the other fellow will muff it up as likely as not , and then where shall i be ?
when one is motoring one might easily say to oneself : if a car came out from that crossroador if that lorry backed suddenlyor if the wheel came off the car that is approachingor if a dog jumped off the hedge on to my driving armeh bien , i should probably be killed !
i dont see my dear friend , you never seeand anyway the english know no geography .
satterthwaite read this correctly as the reserve of the well-trained servant .
miss barton spoke warmly of dr .
he rang up the ritz and asked for julius hersheimmer .
one foot in the grave .
this , then , was the british expert described by lady willard as being a minor official at the british museum .
yes , she thought , all will indeed be well if hori says so .
asked tommy suddenly .
of course , she often cant see people for a couple of days at a time , but if you would risk thatat my expense , of course .
very civil of you , im sure , sir , said mr .
by this .
the others , with the possible exception of the bearded german , merely used it as a rendezvous .
thats what im asking you .
she was always putting things away and clearing them up .
rosalind is absolutely satisfactory , quite enough .
miss marple could not see her murdering anyone else but a husbandand there had been no agamemnon in this house .
tape recorders .
it was given him at that moment by molly and he grunted approval .
i was some time finding him , and when i found him and brought him back , the young lady was nearly all right again .
went on the stage at the age of twenty-three .
she didnt mention any manforgive me , mr .
poor gwenda .
i felt impatient with the mans caution and lack of imagination .
yes , that is so .
she dined here ?
tactful , too , never contradicted an invalid .
neolithic hut dwellers , druids , romans , and even traces of the early phoenicians were to be found .
a very long waythey run along underneath the soil .
and at point-to-points .
he said : my god , elinor , do you want to make me feel an utter cad ?

thanking the man , i departed , somewhat at a loss , and still much incensed with my meddlesome friend .
no , that was quite wrong .
it was a book .
it was , kelsey thought , like a bad dream repeating itself as he entered the brilliantly lighted sports pavilion .

if you will wait in the drawing room a minute , mamma would like to speak to you .

miss blacklock and miss hinchcliffe were crouching over the fire .

a little trouble here .
i thought it just possible that that list we had might tie-up with the narcotic trade somewhere .
jacquelines hand fumbled a moment or two on her lap .
then the cross-examination began .
they found nothing of an incriminating nature .
the kiddles had come and conquered .
but id like to make sure that there is no good reason .
but where exactly do i come in ?
there was a good deal of general confusion , questioning , all the routine business , i suppose .
i attribute much of his success to thatand to his invariable plan of providing a suitable scapegoat .
but she pulled herself up .
she said : monsieur poirot , im afraidim afraid of everything .

im afraid the gardens been allowed to run down for some years .
fou-ling uttered a short bark of agonized protest .
thats what your young people are doing , they think !
a broken mirror means bad luck .
altogether a very neatly planned coup , as one would expect from a master of the game such as the marquis .
shed come in just as crump was bringing in the coffee pot .
well , perhaps that was only natural .
violet shook her head .
as a result of the analysis of the stomach , the time of death was fixed as having occurred not less than an hour after the completion of dinner , with possible extension to an hour after that .
we must lay our hands on the person responsible .
there was far too much to be done unless we all pulled our weight .
that is , if she ever made a will .
he looked from one to the other of the men in the room .
oh well , weve had a lovely time up to now .
ive been asking miss conway for a list of all the recent deaths she could remember .
i will ask you only one in return .
so often you know beforehand what children are going to say , but rosalind usually surprised me .

i thought i knew why they had come .
he stumped off then .
high in the woods the birds are calling .
im going to make sure .

you probably would find them rather old-fashionednot violent enough .
then it will take her about five minutes to walk up the hill .
there are some pictures in the dining room , said susan , but i think they are all her husbands work .
towards the end of the week , however , he announced his intention of paying a visit to bexhill and neighbourhood and suggested that i should come with him .
ii they lunched at a small mountain inn .
look , she invited them .
ive hauled my men over the coals , but they swear they didnt bat an eyelid .
ladies and gentlemen , it boomed , you are now approaching the famous village of gitcham where we shall remain for three-quarters of an hour and where you can have a crab or lobster tea , as well as devonshire cream .
night-night , pongo .
no , agreed the chief constable .
she was jealous , you know .
the pink colour came up in her cheeks .
i made up my mind to marry money when i was quite young .
rose nodded , and as the nurse bicycled away , he went up to the cottage door , rapped sharply and entered .
one doesnt know whether to admire them , or whether to say silly fools .
and besidessomewhere the picture is not true .
hes not in the navy and hes not in the army , but hes just the man for me .
her heart was beating angrily .
shell do for him very nicely , said tommy condescendingly .
i to england come for two week holiday .
three the joke that failed twelve oclock , said socks despairingly .
theyve let us alone , anyway , i observed .
at first it had seemed to him absolute folly to get married in the middle of wartime ; now , a day later , he was equally determined that it was the only right thing for us to do .
by the light of a tiny torch the visitor was examining poirots belongings neatly arranged on top of the dressing-table .
yet another woman , young , calm , dark-haired with a creamy pallor , a placid face not unlike a luini madonna .
certainly , acquiesced the lawyer .
he paused as he reached the door .
and in imagination she saw the judges old hands put the black cap on his head and begin to pronounce sentence .
i need hardly tell you , my dear , how happy we were to do so .
hed never do that .
ehwhat ?
she came from wales and she went back there and marriedroberts her name is now .
lord whitfield objected at first , then suddenly he gave inactually it was sad that he did so .
perhaps it is not to kidnap .
thanks , emma , i will have another cup .
we shall be in brackhampton in exactly seven minutes .
he led the way down the stairs and bundle followed him .
what is she really like , madame ?
she sat up in a minute .
briefly , raymond recounted the events of the afternoon visit that he and horace bindler had paid to greenshaws folly .
oherquite , said the other .
cut a splash , thats what these young fellows want to do .
poirot answered the unspoken question : you would like that i should accompany you ?
she , too , had read of the exhumation in the paper and had been proportionately thrilled by its being old vicar .
that will be lovely , said victoria in a faint voice .
what kind of details ?
tommy raised his hand to his head .
he said : i take my hat off to the woman !
india and china and hong kong and the south of france it wasnt as easy as it would have been fifteen years ago .
again they stared at each other .
poirot did not answer except by bending his head a little .
open window , and footprints outside .
the other possibility is a certain mr .
' an eager assent greeted this proposal .
this woman , who lives in chadminster and knows canon pennyfather by sight , says she saw him entering the train by one of the doors .
too much in the country doesnt do .
although he was a fellow of almost every important society and had rows of letters after his name , the general public scarcely knew of his existence , and his long-learned books , though adding signally to the sum total of human knowledge , had no attraction for the masses .
well , if you remember the big london southern bank robbery some years ago , there was a house in the countrya lonely house .
arden leaned forwardhis voice became confidential .
poirot replied unexpectedly : open your mouth and shut your eyes and see what the fairies will send you i was prevented from replying because nurse craven came tripping hastily across the grass .
london was not bombed .
no wonder he got into scrapes .
the softness of the bed was oppressive , oppressive too were the heavy curtains over the window that blocked out the light and air .
it was not an easy task , but lucy toiled doggedly .
oh , very lucky .
she paused and added , hillside .
that fact will protect you automatically .
and hes still there .
the head of scotland yard or something like that .
he had consulted a doctor about her .
ought not scotland yard to know about it ?
look here , i dont know what you mean .
oh yes they will .
beresfordi fancy the owner is quite content for the house to fall downno repairs are done except to the portion the perrys inhabit .
do you know the place at all ?
no , i dont think they believed what joyce was saying .
he was interested in her approach .
she said at last in a breathless voice , are theythey cant bereal ?
and i thoughtwell , i thought i ought to tell you about it because i didnt like what happened .
you remember me , i hope ?
go home , child , he said , and dont worry ; leave it in my hands .
no , i wont !
she may be technically virtuous , but shes a tart through and through .
but as regards captain marsh poirot stuck to it , gently continuing to goad her into further revelations .
it was a black deed to turn me out and its black bad luck itll bring to you and him !
but then she had money of her own and of course captain marshall is quite well off .
i wished , you see , for the true story of professor luxmores death .
there are those that rule , the few ; and there are the many that serve .
if he had to finish the picture i dont see why he couldnt have taken some photographs and worked from them .
come on , anyway , lets go on looking round .
they returned to the clubhouse together , and as far as was known at the time , were the last people to see captain sessle alive .
shall we have in the next witness ?
plenty of evidence , he said .
was she interested in gardening ?
it was easy .
its so nice , i think , when girls dont grow up too quickly .
in the end it was arranged to dine at the berkeley .
she slipped it off her finger and held it out to him .
a baker , said poirot with scorn .
yes , im sure it was .
i knew it the moment i saw you .
and the papers have vanished .
but not so easy to make a body vanish into thin air .
there is some occasion for anxiety .
the new ambassador has been delayed coming out .
yes , sir , i went all over it last night .
they were , as you might say , all alike to her .
oliver is expecting you , sir .
but the eccleses kept talking of him as william or bill .
if you do , i see the result clearlya death .
so he was , after all , anxious to get a little information about this unknown mr .
suppose that actually nicholson shot bassington-ffrench having induced him first to write a suicides letter of farewell ?
discreetly , of course .
bollard , and then when colonel luscombe is in london next , perhaps hell come in and see what he decides himself hed like to give you .
hes a cold-blooded scoundrel .
elinor said , and her voice trembled a little : have you said anything to her ?
i want , if you permit , to take you with me through the case from the beginning .
that is why , as an older man , a very much older man , i venture to offer you a piece of advice .
luke looked at her thoughtfully , then he said : why , yesi think youre quite right .
despard notices only those things which appeal to himrugs , trophies of sport .
his eyes wandered for a minute to his hostesss face .
i am interestedyes , i am distinctly interested .
first of all i want to know who last saw your aunt and exactly what time that was ?
i have no wish to arrest her as yet .
it was a great honour , you understand , that he should come to inspect , went on the doctor .
not been here very long .
count stepanov , or some such , she remarked , and affecting a frank and unvarnished curiosity : whos he ?
countess anna radzky .
he shook his head , and waved his arms in a gesture of frustration .
yes , vitriol .
hes unlike anyone i ever met , and merton castle is too wonderful .
and she really is just the person for yougood-looking and clever ; absolutely suitable .
presumably to find out something about commander x , said tuppence .
she stayed there for about five minutes .
she wasyour mother , was she not ?
id just say that luther has never felt very adequate as a man himself , and that he bitterly resents his financial position .
glad to see youvery glad .
she said , its heavenly , isnt it ?
if i find that his estate was heavily mortgaged and that mrs .
i have forgotten the name of his boss by this time ; i will call him for convenience mr goldstein .
i once tackled a young naval lieutenant on this point .
he looked ridiculously full of his own importance .
i had some sewing to do .
when the man got round the bend of the staircase he began to whistle softly .
if one of the family was guilty it is possible that they themselves would not know which one .
i want to know if he ever talked to you , in the days when he could talk properly , poor devil , about something called project b .
and then afterwards , continued muriel , i wished i hadnt .
wondering a little , i did so .
elinor said in a puzzled voice : but she wanted to die .
know the worst before its too late .
she might have been a nurse in the operating theatre and administered the wrong anaesthetic or she broke off , suddenly anxious for clearer details .
grown-up , i should imagine , from what ive read here .
to discover what really happened ?
i unbuttoned the jacket and threw it straight back .
feeling rather like judas , i smiled a greeting .
also , he was dying to do several thingsmostly with his hands and feetbut alas , that too had been attended to .
mothers came out on doorsteps calling to their children who , as usual , were busy doing all the things they had been told not to do .
well , dont you see ?
but quite frequently they think wrong !
quelle dception , said hercule poirot , out loud .
i mean that all is not the gold that glitters .
he said : _num_ : _num_ at the luxembourg .
ah , langton would never !
i did not mean to offend you .
welman , before her death , must have been anxious to see her niece suitably settled in life ?
oh , thats weaker still .
alistair blunt said he could give me a few minutes at four fifteen .
i had my mosaic noweach piece beautifully fitted into its place .
it was nice lazing this way .
you should always pay attention to your instincts .
, would be definitely suspicious in a bookalways suspect bluff genial men .
i didjust for a minute .
it can be done on an order from the home office .
always spoiling a fellows sport , he grumbled .
davenheim did not return .
shes always busy arranging something .
you mean upset ?
mcgillicuddy was burdened with a large quantity of parcels ; the result of a days christmas shopping .
yes , she said , hes here .
i wrote to one of them , but it seemed there were difficulties .
let us return to the hotel for lunch , my friend , he said .
he led her over to the sofa and sat down on it beside her .
all the same it looked a bit incongruous there .
pace cannot have been killed before he left , or the doctor would have spotted the time of the crime as being given wrongly when he examined the body , we conclude quite rightly , that mr .
i think i cannot do better than to apprehend a facsimile of the page in question .
it would be pleasanter outsideon the porchwith kamenis singing to listen to .
sometimes we made a round trip of it .
doors were heard to shut .
we waited .
it was a miniature of charlotte done in the style of some twenty-five years ago .
poirot said : i ask your pardon , mr .
was that the trap ?
what did she herself say to you , doctor ?
vyses advice .
dear old dad .
was i , my dear ?
think aheadthe future .
she was dressed in dark green today , and the beauty and charm of the proud little face was more evident than ever .
he shot out .
he said it had interesting points , but was far too expensive to produce and had not enough humour .
it sounds dreadful to say so , but you know what i mean .
id forgotten that , i admitted .
come , now , monsieur , would you say this little affair of ours is dull as ditchwater ?
' not at all - not at all .
but it was very decidedly cheaper .
this time the laughter was more apparent , but blunt was following out an idea of his own .
he rang the bell and enquired for miss clegg .
bantry shook him .
he had just done so when she was announced .
safetyand a comfortable home .
i could see how fond ellie was of her .
donaldson left the room .
a slatternly woman , wiping her hands on her apron , opened the door and looked at her suspiciously .
greta was naturally very fond of her only brother , but equally naturally she had very little time to give him .
its that liver of yours .
by the way , what is your last name ?
she did not drown herselfshe was murderedand i know who murdered her .
in fact , i said , if you find a dagger planted by your pillow tomorrow morninglet the criminal who put it there beware !
that old cat of a white knight of hers , gives her nothing but carbohydrates .

maverick was serious as always .
what is there to go to regents park for ?
now ill tell you thisthey didnt like itthey didnt like it at all .
the young doctor said cheerfully , that ought to take care of her for about six hours , anyway .
and he doesnt realize it !
i found that it would arrive at _num_ : _num_ on the following afternoon and depart again at _num_ .
a deep hissing soundspeak low , where is your bag ?
he opened the door of the secret chamber and bundle passed in , catching her breath in surprise as she did so .
and my sister-in-laws name is rosaleen , finished mrs .
he went straight to the studio .
the letter engaging us ?
lord whitfield rubbed his nose .
but james bentley was not attracted by hope .
and after you , mademoiselle ?
but you have got to , mr petherick , said joyce .
no , as i said , i havent met her yet .
did she destroy it ?
hes a clever doctor , i believe .
nurse hopkins responded instantly : now , what might you mean by that ?
i suggested doubtfully .
norton ?
my american trustee , andrew pennington .
i dont like solicitors .
this miss cray , the actressshe traipses over here borrowing matches .
the simplest kind of crime .
just mr .
theyre not worth much either , im afraid , said sir rowland , handing the remaining autograph and the envelope to hugo , who passed them on to pippa , murmuring sympathetically as he did so , sorry , my dear .
lightning development of negative , successful identification of fingerprintsand photo .
he looked very tall .
then i jumped to my feet .
the name , rafiel , clearly meant nothing to the elderly gardener .
just come across the other side , will you ?
cocker always wore a pair for washing up .

he knows where it comes from , he knows where it goes , he knows why it goes , he knows whos behind things .

sir charles seemed a sadder and older man when he spoke again .

keenewhats all this ?
i came down , and young jan said , richards been shot .
no man can resist you , farrar exclaimed angrily .
shes no fun , thoughone of those painfully pure girls , with the kind of hair that has just become fashionable by accident .
but most people are rather more inquisitive than you are .
' ' oh , no , it was really a clever bit of deduction on your part .
i dont think that could be my friend .
its a splendid idea .
she wants us all to come up and have coffee with her this evening .
as for miss marple , once she had caught a glimpse out of her bedroom window of lucy eyelesbarrow really trenching for sweet peas in the proper way , she had leaned back on her pillows with a sigh of relief , eaten the tempting little meals that lucy eyelesbarrow brought to her , and listened , agreeably surprised , to the tales told by her elderly irascible maidservant of how i taught that miss eyelesbarrow a crochet pattern what shed never heard of !
the king , he frowned in anger , his hand upon his sword .
i washed and shaved and changed .
it was true that poirot had not definitely said that x was a man .
he looked round him with satisfaction .
that also , maybe , said tommy , but i could give you another list .
archdeacon brabazon turned out to be the elderly cleric whom she had noticed at the memorial service .
what are you saying ?
alix was forced to give way to him , but his insistence surprised and alarmed her .
i do , bundle , i do .
i disliked her a good deal .
then , to my utter astonishment , poirot pronounced these words : i do not agree with you .
his mother was long since dead , and his skill in packing and unpacking had been acquired solely in the service of colonel pikeaway .
she said : ive met a ghost .
on the slope of the lawn thousands of daffodils had been planted .
christows son .
thats bunkum .
and anyway who the devil should i want to murder ?
sophias voice came with a kind of hard desperation in it .
luke said : are you threatening us ?
ive heard a lot about him too lately , and hes no beauty , i can tell you .
i dont really know much about the subject .
secluded .
i also decided on attacking the local house agents , as having fewer houses on their books .
things slip his memory once theyre past and done with .
i gave orders that ' no stranger was to be admitted , and that no one was to leave the house .
in a minute he was with us .
van aldin had been called carrots and ginger in his time , and ruths hair was almost pure auburn .
oliver , because there are so many things they want to do and have just then .
about our problem of the double suicide ?
not a girl whom youd trust and believe what she said ?
an english girl ?
but shell never do such a thing , i objected .
sometimes he used to shoot into the wall , making patterns .
said his father , unemotionally .
unless somebody pushed little tommy whats-his-name out of the window .
wed brought down provisions with us .
they dislike luxury , prefer austerity and are suspicious of possessions .
wellyou are not satisfied , my friend ?
straight from the horse ' s mouth .
there were only two house agents in dillmouth .
something awful had happened in that very room i knew it !
shes just gone off to bed .
the wrapping fell aside .
mcgillicuddy had descended .
they forbade her to see him .
nobody can overhear .
but if youre ill ?
just as you say .
tommy felt his ascendancy less sure than a moment before .
but what ive been through do not think me too unfeeling .
then hes all for clearing off back to london .
do your damnedest .
i thought , you know , that perhaps whoever wrote might have got hold of some wrong name , or that there had been a mistake .
so strong was the illusion that she almost fancied she could make out the outline of a form .
bring me a small helping of sago pudding .
nothat was later tell me .
mother , im not tired .
im afraid , maam , said nursie apologetically to mother the next day , miss agatha can read .
summer was over .
no , he said to himself , no , you did not go to the tea tent yesterday afternoon .
i suppose not , i said slowly , and yetin a wayi think i do .
it was a kind of frozen beauty , austere and almost forbidding .
i cant say ive ever seen you ruffled .
a dark blue coat , trousers and waistcoat .
louise wondered if she drank .
its not in this room , said stein .
ill tell you frankly some of your conversation was overheard .
bless ordinary everyday afternoon tea !
he had a good breakfast , glanced at the papers which were full of the new discoveries of oil in herzoslovakia , and then demanded an interview with the manager and being anthony cade , with a gift for getting his own way by means of quiet determination he obtained what he asked for .
then she said abruptly : hesters coming home today .
blessed if i really know , he said .
are you going to visit marrakesh , mrs .
it must be very dull for you here , she said slowly .
and afterwardsafterwards the evil spell was broken .
there was a letter and a fairly thick enclosure .
its about thoramiss grey , he said .
no , she came after that .
a cousin of bettertons first wife .
other people say that he buried her somewhere and nobodys found her .
if youre so convinced , then why mrs .
irish blood , said macmaster .
wish , m .
joanna refixed her attention on the road .
it was at a hotel in the west indies .
if ever a man had the devils own luck , said dr .
the chief constable indicated a chair .
and so your wife took that glass and did what with it ?
poirot sat by smiling .
stop 	the dole , that ' s what i say .
unfortunately there is no doubt about it , mr .
it wasnt suicideim sure it wasnt suicidebut how can it have been murder ?
how thorough you are , i said .
it was clear to hercule poirot that cecilia williams lived very near the bone .
how very odd i certainly didnt send them .
a very sound man , im sure , said stafford nye politely .
she turned now to the chest of drawers , more with a wish to feel that she had left nothing undone than from any expectation of finding what she sought .
remember , madame , you are csars wife .
the money will be most agreeablemost agreeable .
he spoke slowly with hesitation .
anywhere , replied lucia , with growing excitement .
in silence we arrived at the door of the shed .
it was difficult to see clearly .
laurence is a complete rabbit .
my friend was sent for to the police station .
dont suppose shell ever remember about it , though .
when my wife suggested a divorce , i refused point blank .
the kettles got to boil .
one day greta said at lunchtime : you and your gipsies !
and i picked up the little pot and went and got some water in it and we put the flowers in .
butbut what do they think ?
see , she said as she did so , you slide this out , and theres a sort of little catch thing underneath .
here i am , in possession of knowledge which i have not , so far , communicated to the policebut knowledge which , perhaps , it is my duty to communicate to them .
she had wanted , definitely , to keep despard to herself .
lawrence cavendish was mistaken .
remarkable , really very remarkable , absolutely the most remarkable thing i have ever come across in my life .
she opened her handbag .
weve been looking for you .
she took a step or two back and looked at hardcastle as though he were the fiend in person .
it seemed to me that i should merely put the fellow on his guard and learn nothing .
the sweet , cloying smell filled her nostrils .
she said that the accident was quite unavoidablethe little boy just suddenly rushed out , straight in front of the car .
it was on the right .
they are connected in this way , madame , the man who was murdered was the man responsible for the kidnapping and murder of mrs .
oh , thats easy .
oh , you can have herbut its awfully good of you .
a legacy of a thousand pounds to mr .
a most unattractive woman with a most unattractive friend .
shes a wonderful womanand a damned fine shot .
asked poirot gently .
silence , my friends , i beg of you .
satterthwaite , big trouble .
the morphine loses one molecule of water .
it was frightfully noble of himbut very silly .
i should myself .
she looked towards a vase of rather temperamental-looking chrysanthemums , then back to the prim circle of rosebuds .
making sacrifices for ones children , i mean , he added in answer to gwendas enquiring look .
and mark you , monsieur , my work was interesting work .
why are you sure ?
hes just conscious , but i doubt if he has the force to speak .
we wondered a little why it was called the laurels , said tuppence .
conway jefferson looked up at her for a moment .
lytcham close was one of the most famous old houses in england .
she had always been accustomed to think of kait as rather a stupid womansomeone gentle and submissive , but rather negligible .
by the way , a small enamel box was found on the dead man .
then , and only then , youd sink into the background of lymstock high street , and not stand out as you do at present .
personally i thought a dash of inferiority complex would do japp no harm , but there was no point in arguing the matter .
but they usually spoke french and im not very good at french myself though i learnt it as a girl at school .
the hum of voices , which had come to her for a minute or two , rather like the far-off roar of sea waves , ceased as suddenly as it had begun , and bundle heard the sound of a bolt being shot .
im not going to bother .
and i must be getting on my way , she added .
so now we arrive at the point where not only the behaviour of the murderer is extraordinary , but the behaviour of simeon lee also is extraordinary !
were long-livers in our family , we are .
iii nibbling delicately at a scone and balancing a cup of tea on his knee , hercule poirot allowed himself to become confidential with his hostess .
and iris didnt want it to be anthony browne .
binion .
he wanted marguerita clayton .
some people think so , i know .
and yet i know .
i put the kippers in the frying pan .
aunt emily made no secret of it .
what is the purpose of it ?
one wants to know , said celia .
but shes quite good company and a really first-class bridge player .
the count looked thoroughly puzzled by poirots queries .
his face suddenly went rather white .
ooyoure pulling it out by the rootshow clumsy you are , nevile , do be quick .
spenlow with something like eagerness , that i might , perhaps , have a pergola on the west side of the cottage .
you will hear a man say who works in an office , i should like to exploreto rough it in far countries .
to do so would have been most impertinent .
he was not a boyto be turned this way and that by the whim of the moment .
christine redfern said : shes not just any pretty woman !
poirot looked at him for some minutes .
inspector curry cast a quiet sideways glance at the young man .
but i will tell you my idea , and youll see that im right .
we must want to be free !
mcgillicuddy consulted her watch doubtfully .
they get very autocratic and insist on everything being done exactly as they say and are altogether very difficult to deal with .
pye i said sharply : so you have considered him ?
but the accident to the train changes everything .
you dont think freddie murmured dejectedly .
and i had an idea she might know something about the destroying of the will .
doubtless some careless gardeneryes , yes , there may be an instrument , but the purpose behind is plain ; and i will tell you this , m .
it was bad policy to make your sons discontented .
i never heard of it .
what should all be over ?
dont believe him , charles .
gardening perhapsor the use of weed killer .
with the theft of the pearls , then ?
but youreyoure so different from what i would have imagined .
not poisoning .
you just walked out from the little flower-covered pavilion on to the tarmac .
but the main thing , continued robin , is for you to feel happy about it !
what else was there ?
i suppose so .
i took a taxi and we drove straight to mirotin , joannas dressmaker .
it beats me how people think up such things , let alone say them .
i knew something awful was going to happeni knew nevile meant it to happenand that it was to happen to me .
but when i got home i found there was a label on it and instead of saying _num_ .
honestly .
what made her think that the dead child might have been my dead child ?
he knew i was heading that way .
this time poirot gave it up .
the wound was on the side of the head , a heavy blow with some blunt instrument had crushed in the skull .
it seems to me ratherera fluid one .
you know those days when everything in the world seems right .
but not , i gather , a depressed man , said inspector neele .
he dismissed pierce .
his nephew considered for a momentthen he said : welli thinknot a coincidence .
thats right , said dakin approvingly .
and id say , too , that what she did know wasnt very much .
oneill is about fifty , he has a grey beard and wears glasses and stoops .
he studied her for a moment before replying .
she might , said sybil .
devonshire cream , too , was eaten in quantities ; so much nicer than cod liver oil , my mother used to say .
she had heard a sound .
there was insanity in her family .
lady angkatell went back to her room .
theres been no mention of these things being missing .
they do a lot of good .
i suppose you can give me no idea to whom these letters were addressed ?
luscombe , myself and another .
' wrapping the folds of his dressing-gown round him , the old man half-rose from his chair .
' ' no - er - really , chief inspector , irtserem these questicns very much ?
hes in charge of the case and hes here now .
no more headache than my foot , said miss brewis crossly , and disappeared into her office , closing the door behind her .
he had a girl with him , but she seemed kind of limp as though shed had a dose of the same dope .
father gorman quickened his steps .
i am inclined to the theory of an astral body .
she cried out : the soldiers !
but he did have this obstinate fixation about mrs .
the body had , of course , been removed .
it just never occurred to us that he could want to !
since then anthony had definitely become part of her life .
perhaps , said m .
he had made edward look soso pale by comparison .
my boots were smeared with a preparation of aniseed tonight , before i came down to the terrace in my brothers place .
in the middle of the bridge he saw the picture he was going to paint .
the emir ibrahim , shaistas uncle , is taking her out tomorrow chaddy .
he went out of the cabin and along the deck .
they are not bribed to silence .
weston sat up in his chair .
she had chosen his friends for him , and directed him to suitable hobbies .
iris ?
finally you tried to induce her to marry you secretly .
horlick stared after them for a minute or two , then slowly resumed his progress with the wheelbarrow .
bundle gave her evidence .
his presence in sofiagrad had been due entirely to a blameless interest in the rarer wild flowers and to the urgencies of an elderly friend of his , lady lucy cleghorn , who was indefatigable in her quest for these shy floral rarities , and who at any moment would scale a rock cliff or leap joyously into a bog at the sight of some flowerlet , the length of whose latin name was in inverse proportion to its size .
i havent really thought , said gina .
josie was very plucky about itfor it hurt her , i could see .
a man of medium heighthe thought fair-hairedrather military buildof somewhat nondescript appearance .
i had just reached the top when the telephone rang in the hall below .
they said , with a singular lack of originality , theres that damned dago , shaitana !
yes i didnt want to at firstbut dr .
there he found an old man who wouldnt say his prayers and he took him by the left leg and threw him down the stairs .
that planes revved up four times .
i shall go for that fellow japp , when i next see him !
simple , isnt it ?
dash it all , it wasnt decent !
i wouldnt .
there was no fight .
poirot drew himself up and glanced at me reproachfully .
perry , at least , knows something , or certainly knew something once .
poirot turned back to inspector hardcastle .
there was a mist rising from the sea , and at that particular point the path turns abruptly inland .
fourteen garden campaign you understand , albert , said tommy .
battle nodded an unhappy head .
cade , he said pompously , that i consider your action in that matter highly reprehensible .
and i think she was going to meet someone .
its not her fault .
it was a shotfrom henrys study .
the tray of glasses had been removed .
they often discussed it and laughed and joked about the rich uncle in devonshire .
lord whitfield chuckled .
and nownow , i suppose , it will all be raked up again .
in the garden old foster said to gwenda , is that dr .
colonel atkinson shook his head .
and bertrams hotel , of course .
he was just saying here , ill take it , when albert spoke .
a detective .
i put the sandwiches down there , clarissa told him , pointing to the stool , and then i began tidying up , and i went to put a book back on the bookshelf andthenand then i practically fell over it .
but clumsy , all the samefor i had no suspicionat least hardly any suspicion .
shall i get up and say to twelve stolid cornishmen that i , hercule poirot , know ?
theres a lot of villas all the way along , but by degrees they seemed to get more and more thinned out , and in the end we got to one that seemed the last of the bunch .
how long had the lady stayed ?
into this pandemonium stepped poirot , neat and smiling .
youll see that hes just the type of person who would commit these murders .
the rest of her ornaments were real but comparatively inexpensive .
then he looked up at various dim shapes that prowled high on the walls of the alley , one of which was uttering a blood-curdling yawl .
satipy said , has nofret complained ?
you displayed an absolute genius for getting to the truth .
he looked as though he would have expanded on this theme had not miss amory entered at that moment .
its so hard to remember exactly now .
always with you it is the nonessentials !
ive never seen the woman .
a doctor has to be .
it ought to be something deadly serious to justify that , and he laughed as he pushed back his chair and rose to leave the room .
known as silent stephen .
it is her rejection of him that is the supreme insult !
they both recovered themselves , and the man muttered an apology , his eyes scanning anthonys face narrowly .
yes , i , hercule poirot , have descended to depths such as these .
' excuse me , mademoiselle , but were you not afraid to trust yourself alone there at night ?
through a side door of the house a man came out with a hoe and passed out of sight through a little gate .
one wondered in reading the article where those four women were now , mused poirot .
cheer up , old thing , it cant be helped .
he paused , then went on : we are still faced by one very grave problem .
it nourishes the nerves , you comprehend , poirot explained .
cavendish , we are here to arrive at the truth of this matter , and welcome anything that may lead to further elucidation .
you do understand .
i was interested at assuan in the relations existing between you .
shell miss me when payday comes alongbut i dare say shell soon find a friend elsewhere .
you are comfortable there , i hope ?
lady frances derwent .
i heard things .
i should not ask the same questions as the police have asked .
he slipped his hand under the pillow and drew out the automatic pistol which ratchett had shown him the day before .
but now where was tuppence ?
parker might have taken the letter , i admitted .
but what a horror , what an infamya woman so young and so beautifulindeed an inhuman crime !
ipy gave a quick uneasy laugh .
the contents of the suitcases had been examined , but had given no useful lead .
yes , she thought .
why do you say lord altamount ?
it was of miss russell that i had been reminded that night outside the gates of fernly park .
is to be made .
ah no , my dear , it would not be nice , that .
youre from scotland yard , arent you ?
suggestions for planting at this time of year .
i get to england .
his shoulders lookedwell , set , if you know what i mean .
so i said , well , where is this photograph ?
they are the youth of france .
then they fell back into place .
then he went on , what did you say just now ?
entwhistle , from the depths of his experience , recognized it .
owing to the heavy cut glass , a small quantity of a colourless liquid is quite undetectable .
its sir claud amory again , sir , he said .
she waits well .
mademoiselle , said poirot , will you let an old man congratulate you on your courage and your loyalty ?
but the small allowance that pengelley might have given her upon her marriage was not enough for you .
hardly an author , a dentist or a doctor .
oh edgar hasnt brains enough to be a secretary .
but the house belongs to sir george stubbs .
diagrams ?
she could feel her long , pointed nails biting into the flesh of her palms .
the heart of woman does not change .
then he uttered a quick exclamation of pleasure and picked up a letter with an american stamp on it .
the lonely lady took it , and made a pretence of examining it with minute care .
bryan martin entered .
and who was theerchap ?
i was brought up to a trade , you know , continued anthony .
i amas you sayon the job !
because ive heard of you , and i know youre a clever man .
her cheeks were rather pink and she seemed flustered .
perhaps you have already done so ?
we dont want any of the four to suspect what were doing .
your views on schizophrenia are frightfully interesting .
jeremy picked up a pair of gloves from the sofa .
yes , said micky .
you see , lucia is so trusting !
of course not , my dear sir .
and the children had not come .
he found his breath was coming unevenly .
now , miss lingard , i wonder if you know anything that can throw light on this tragedy ?
vi yahmose .
she poked round outhouses , prodded the briars which wreathed the old pigsties , and was peering into the boiler room under the greenhouse when she heard a dry cough and turned to find old hillman , the gardener , looking at her disapprovingly .
not deadwe were puzzled , we knew no robert .
beginning to know she could have them .
let me see nowi had a twingesomebody told me morley of queen charlotte street was the man to go tono , i cant for the life of me remember who it was .
supposing someone had forestalled him ?
so long !
he came out of it , to remark abruptly : it was from a train such as this that vincent lemesurier fell ?
but i thought id wait until after the funeral .
beeton says , to catch the hare .
you are one of those people who look so mild , and really wallow in blood .
the doors were boltedour own eyes have told us thatyet the presence of the candle grease on the floor , and the destruction of the will , prove that during the night someone entered the room .
praising his bridge - which actually was far from brilliant .
ah , but they are cunningces gens l !
two women got out of the taxi .
theyll play with an old bit of string or a rag doll or something they call a pet bear which is only a bit of a hearthrug just made up into a bundle with a couple of black boot-button eyes put on it .
i am disposed to believe you .
his bearing was alertalthough he was plainly nervous .
he looked straight at christopher wren .
thats just why being comfortable is so attractive .
gwenda drove up to the front door and rang the bell .
fortescue who has recently died .
between _num_ a .
what have you been up to , minx ?
when he had moved out of sight , laura turned to face julian farrar again .
she threw back her head and laugheda shrill laugh without merriment .
the deep grey eyes opened wide , stared up at him .
then i think i should tell himabout the steps .
tuppence said : i can do all that twenty years from now .
i only accepted the principle of it .
you may be right , he said at last .
i wish that chap peel edgerton had been with us , said tommy thoughtfully .
david nodded .
the lass told me that he had his coat off and that he was holding the sleeve of it , and it was all wetthats right , eh , lass ?
his death was due to poisoning by a powerful vegetable alkaloid , graham declared .
her face was not peacefulit still showed the agony of her death .
mr spenlows statement was that he came over here as requested , leaving his own house at ten minutes past three ; that on arrival here he was informed by the maid-servant that miss marple was not at ome .
this object , gentlemen , is the native thorn shot from a blowpipe by certain tribeseri cannot be exactly certain now if it is south american tribes or whether it is the inhabitants of borneo which i have in mind ; but that is undoubtedly a native dart that has been aimed by a blowpipe , and i strongly suspect that on the tip is the famous arrow poison of the south american indians , finished hercule poirot .
an admirable sentiment .
somebody pretty high up in the social scale is doing the distributing .
still , there it is , and i do think , darling , its a shame you cant be there .
i was badly knocked on the head , but i came to and managed to crawl into the bush .
but you know , you always do know .
it was exciting and wonderful .
oily black hair hung in a kind of circular bob down the back of his neck and over his eyes in front .
the psychology is very clear .
all the compartments are full .
miss lemon laid a small brown paper parcel before poirot .
i dont want any food .
they confide in meyes .
let that be the end of things .
a very delicate matter , murmured the duke .
was she of a happy disposition ?
when , however , he saw what was going on , he quickly retired to another window , but he had seen something first .
they both looked at each other and smiled .
she cant leave anyone alone ; she is always scolding them or managing them , or doing somethingshe cant keep quiet .
allerton would have met him if hed gone aft .
changing the subject , carrington said in a slightly over-casual manner : ' attractive woman , mrs vandefiyn - eh ?
no , sir , it was not .
that ones precious resident cook-housekeeper has had her precious child bitten in the face by ones precious dog is the last news one wishes to hear on returning to ones household .
lynn half-closed her eyes .
nothing seems to be disarranged ?
now what about you two ?
he still thought i was a little spanish peasant girl .
i think she despised him a little for that .
its the report of the handwriting experts .
janet is an elderly woman .
the one whos in charge of the case .
i thought wed got her cleared of suspicion , and nowdoes every girl on this blinking boat carry around pearl-handled toy pistols ?
say within the range of possibility .
he held the door open and frankie found herself shaking hands with him and being ushered to the front door .
meredith used to trot round after carolinebut he was quite a dear .
your card was in the box .
george , darling , this wont blight your career , will it ?
' he ripped open the envelope that he held .
i have heard of mrs .
neele was frowning .
egg looked more closely at the erection on the table .
she didnt tell me , he said .
it is a pleasant spot you have found here , said poirot .
it was really a most comfortable car .
and therefore , said poirot in a matter-of-fact tone , you might just as well tell me the whole story .
that boulder , if it was done with intent , was sent on its course very accurately .
i was confused and delighted by these unexpected words .
sir henry said it would suit him admirably .
rather dull .
' ' certainly i will come .
apart from the grange , there isnt many big houses round about .
im just putting all the possibilities before you .
you had come , doubtless , to the same conclusion that i hadnamely that the deaths of anthony marston and mrs .
what sort of a woman was mrs .
i have reappeared again , i told him solemnly .
you are not wellunstrung i am perfectly well , ioh , god !
youre a spy , thats what you are !
he startedstared at her , then laughed aloud .
neele drew a deep breath .
those that isnt dont know what trouble is !
ill go and have a word with the reporter chap .
when did you see her last ?
in fact i should like it .
mary stooped to retrieve the last item , a small mirror , upon recovering which miss marple exclaimed fervently , how lucky , now , that that isnt broken .
poirot , especially when it gets the upper hand .
i found shed been sent to trearne , folbridge , cornwall .
she had a dry , ironic form of conversation that was alarming but stimulating .
ive got some somewhere , but theyre always falling off my nose or else i lose them .
when i did , it was simplicity itself .
quin , it is you who do the conjuring tricks , not i .
i imagine not , starkwedder remarked .
nice , quiet , unassuming fellow .
its this way , he said , so far , weve only seen the case from the outside .
theres only one crescent here .
he picked up one which had escaped the weight of my beetle-crushers .
she must have time to think what to do next .
_num_ courseaway to a clump of pine trees on a hill , and beyond it , to the dimness of hazy countryside .
it was , he thought , an interesting pattern .
strange and ask her to accompany me .
sophia shook her head .
you have told us it is only the murderer you seek , and that you are not concerned over the jewels .
id been taken into the house , said mrs .
stephen had had a drop too much one day and spoke to him saucylike , and got the sack for it .
after the stress of lunch was over she said to her husband : timive been thinkingif victoria is going around talking about this perhaps we ought just to ask someone about it ?
why should a pleasant , enjoyable evenings play go on for thirteen years .
lestrange had been subpoenaed to give evidence , but a medical certificate , signed by dr .
he had enough pull with the home office and the cid to arrange his interview with the prisoner .
i soothed mrs .
a cabin steward met them .
she died the same way as ellie .
the result is so appalling .
of all the damn fool ways to commit a murder poirot , who had been sitting with his eyes down , smoking quietly , interposed a question .
where is ralph ?
i dont go round taking an inventory of my possessions every day .
we had an argument and i may have got a bit heated , but we parted on perfectly friendly termsagreeing to differ .
elise jumped at the sound .
well , its no good being tied to a man whos going to be in prison for years , is it ?
frankie was finishing dressing when she heard their car drive up to the front door .
bit of a bad lot , if you ask me .
i believe its supposed to be one of the finest necklaces in the worldthe pearls are so beautifully matched and so perfect in colour .
to her satisfaction the key of the spare room wardrobe also fitted the chest of drawers .
it is dead , you see its not so attractive as some of the others .
would you like a cup of tea , he added , or would you prefer a purple heart or a tranquilliser ?
your husband was a fighter pilot , wasnt he ?
i slipped out of my room quietly .
what one is afraid of .
he did not like veronicas scent .
' the girl sat down .
he came in a gufaone of those native boatsand he wasnt followed .
miss wills said nothing .
she thought : its fantastic and unbelievablea dead city .
i was alone with my chaotic thoughts and i didnt want to be alone .
but the sound did not come again .
he made a movement to follow her , then abandoned it .
biddy fox likes boys .
and the wife had fallen in love with the young man .
it must have cost the earth !
but there , thats men all over .
gone abroad somewhere .
and suppression of ones particular delusion has a disastrous effect very often .
the pendleburys were quite right about this place , elmer .
and then as it ceased the brass hook outside the door was rattled violently as by a cats paw .
thats true , acknowledged luke .
at some time during today four clocks were brought here .
she said : of course .
or more ?
how many would you like ?
we had allowed nurse palmer to precede us by about twenty minutes , so that there should be no question of our all arriving together .
but they were not different .
well , said harold .
the establishment of motive , said poirot .
she repeated the last word .
anyway its worth trying .
and if she wont ?
come tomorrow at the same time .
at the end was another glass door .
the car turned in through the gates of the british embassy .
i like living .
oliveri did introduce you , didnt i , to my friend mrs .
stephen said : has somebody been giving mrs .
the thing one imaginedthe impossible thing , the thing that could not bewas real !
then peter lord said : oh , well , i suppose she and roderick welman will live happy ever afterwards .
wanting to go everywheredances and tennis and all that .
anyone can be a doctor !
you mean , am i asking you whether you think or know that your mother killed your father or your father killed your mother , or whether it was a double suicide .
flora joined me by the silver table , and expressed heretical doubts as to king charles i ever having worn the baby shoe .
cash , you know .
oh , david , i couldnt refuse .
only i cant remember just now where it is .
her train of thought was slightly hampered by betty sprot , who had pranced in at an early hour , preceding indeed the cup of somewhat tepid inky liquid known as morning tea .
one of the two , then , was just paddingpresumably the latter .
they went back to lazenbys house and it was then that battle announced that he had a question to ask .
theyre in the study .
captain trevelyan built that , i understand ?
im afraid , you know , that things do get round in the most extraordinary way .
japp said : ' you didn ' t try and look through the keyhole , miss plenderleith ?
everyone , you see , saw her from a slightly different angle .
they always say humility is a christian virtuenow i see why .
miss carnaby sighed deeply and said : i thought the master put it all so beautifully at the service last night .
we were all busy during the morning arranging and decorating the hall in the village where it was to take place .
charming , said mrs .
then why did you go ?
but why is this , father ?
and after all , i was only talking sense .
and he looked at me with that , you know , little twinkle he has in his eye sometimes and said , well what would you consider sensible ?
you are going to the library where you are going to read the passage about the death of socrates .
who are those people and why have they upset you so ?
commit a second murder , or lie low and accept the first as a kind of macabre present ?
satterthwaite stood for a minute looking down on the heap of huddled chiffon .
yesvery fortunate she took that overdoseorwas given it ?
i am in good health , i am thankful to say , sir .
the disappearing soldier boys on the dinner table !
she had sat staring at him over the rim of her teacup .
its beautiful , she said .
shes always been a queer girlshes not friends with any of the girls round here .
she still stared at him with large defiant eyes .
with a vague gesture dr .
such a worship of weakness , such snivelling humiliation !
a second switch turned off the hall light .
she wasnt quite real , you know .
this wretched girl looks just like a wilting lettuce .
oh , i dont know , said cherry .
wake , the rector , andwho else is there , gordon ?
now listen , jan darling , laura began , but jan would not be interrupted .
he wanted to see someone there .
if its the money youre after , youve come to the wrong man !
did she ever specifically mention committing suicide ?
she watched him .
perhaps she hadbut if so , only innocently .
giles said incredulously , a death for each of them ?
only a little pebble , said dubosc , smiling and throwing it away .
and the house next door was too far away to hear if she screamed .
i sent hilary craven off on a journey to a destination unknown , but it seems to me that her journeys end is the usual one after all .
iii dont see why you want to come to me , said dr .
now one can hardly get along the pavements for the crowd .
she was not much given to turning mattresses , and as far as washing up went miss marple always now passed the pantry door with her head turned away so as not to observe cherrys method which was that of thrusting everything into the sink together and letting loose a snowstorm of detergent on it .
she was running away from me .
supposing mademoiselle had been found shot lying in the hotel garden ?
i retain scraps of knowledge thus acquiredwhat are the three diseases of wheat ?
kettering had given to her husband .
cant tell you anything about india , said miss peabody .
she was no longer a child .
i call that rather rough on the lad .
seven _num_ the next day passed uneventfully to all appearances , yet to miss marple it seemed that there were signs of an inner tension .
wont she ?
anything .
she clung to him .
he felt he was not being taken seriously .
he was self-indulgent and extravagant , with no veneration for anything on earth , but he was lovable nevertheless , and his friends were all devoted to him .
lemesurier .
sugden summarized the position neatly .
is he upstairs ?
you dont know where to look for him , and its about a thousand to one against your running against him by accident .
the fact of the matter is , i said , wishing myself anywhere else but where i was , that i met a young lady , an acquaintance of mine .
glynne who , from a word she had let fall when she showed miss marple up to the bedroom appointed to her , had inherited it with her sisters from an uncle and had come here to live with her sisters after her husband had died .
as long as shes my wife , its bound to be my business too .
we left her , as we thought , on the boat .
she said it very simply but in complete good faith .
i hear he is discontented .
such pretty manners .
in what way , inspector ?
_num_ : at the cross roads in storyteller , december _num_ .
oh , it didnt matter , professor purdy , it didnt matter at all .
then he sits down on the step and barks till hes let in .
you see , ive no experience in love affairsthey havent come my way .
well , but i meanwhy come to me ?
a stifled , checked , emasculated sneeze , but a startling sound in the deadly quiet of the room .
do you remember what flossie monro told us before she died ?
ingles , with a faint smile ; the adjective is perfectly understood .
miss howards evidence , unimportant as it was , had been given in such a downright straightforward manner that it had never occurred to me to doubt her sincerity .
he certainly couldnt imagine lady stubbs toiling or spinning .
he went through the communicating door and stopped as a young man in overalls who was bending over a suitcase straightened up to face him , looking rather startled .
by the way , mrs .
as it happens , i have just received a small legacya very small one , but it enables my sister and myself to keep and feed ourselves in a frugal manner so that i am not absolutely dependent on what i earn .
that is certain .
i believed that if she had had any fear of him , any sudden knowledge of something evil in him , she would have broken her pledge to marry him and have come to me and told me of her fear , of her knowledge of him .
he didnt quite understand it all .
ii dont know what you mean , gasped dinsmead .
harry looked at me .
lots of fun still .
cloade , major porter has definitely recognized it as the body of his friend robert underhay .
he had always expected to see mr .
i was quite all right just now .
rivington nodded with desperate intelligence .
i am very sorry for you , she said , very sorry .
thats what comes of having a ferreting little spy in the house .
sweetiman , stepped into the station wagon and was driven rapidly away in the direction of kilchester .
she murmured to herself , was it your poor child ?
what do you meanhelping us ?
mccrae purse her lips anxiously , although not really disapproving , because definitely her master had got to be tracked down .
said suzanne gently .
so sordid , most of them .
firstly , youre the goods as usual .
its so awful when people are always right .
how the devil did he cut these cords ?
what happened to this boy , william his name was , i dont know .
thats why she stopped .
aye , thats right , said mr .
i don ' t want to do it- i loathe doing it- but i ' ve got to ' 	his voice had risen shrilly .
my husband and i bought this place in a fit of madness and have been trying to make a paying concern of it .
this is in confidence entre nous .
and i am not alone in this .
well , sir , angell told him , the circumstances in which this job came to an end are very distasteful to me .
i will demonstrate .
vurry nice for mrs .
the fatal little gold box with its deadly contentspathetic figure of a young girl with all the world before her !
he agreed that the letter was incoherent , but he did not think it had been written in a hurry .
laura responded with bitterness in her voice .
i recognize the voice .
is he a crook too ?
satterthwaite shivered again and remembered that the fire in the library was usually a good one .
morning , missus , said clarence .
the box was full , untouched ; not a chocolate was missingbut that only made the peculiarity that had caught my eye more striking .
she will be near you all night .
i must be right .
youre a precious old humbug .
moreover the old lawyer realized very clearly that timothy abernethie had probably always been secretly jealous of his brother richard .
mary mead) and she saw very clearly the dark handsome face of stephen restarick as he stood facing gina , talking eagerly .
thank you , dolly , said miss marple , i expect i shall .
the bill for repairing it will go to the police , do you understand ?
everything was silent .
this , i may say , was on the preceding afternoon .
she wanted to pretend , you see , that shed never even handled the stuff .
put them in the kitchen stove of course !
but i was still worried .
we found him reclining on some cushions , clad in an amazing dressing-gown of purple and orange .
poirotwhen caroline crale said at the trial that she took the stuff for herself , ill swear she was speaking the truth !
the colour came back to her face .
that dark blue coat you wore at dinner the night of the murder , its got fair hairs inside the collar and on the shoulders ?
but harry was still staring at colonel race .
at the end of half an hour , the latter recalled herself suddenly .
she was gazing at the fire , and on her lips was a smile of satisfied malice .
and the other victim , miss logan ?
' ' that ' s my business , mr chief inspector .
well have to break the door down .
she has masses and masses of cats .
it is very interesting .
yes , and it comes expensive running two establishments .
i return in three minutes , he said .
they do it .
i think that from the start that fascinated us .
thank you , said poirot .
meredith blake has his back to the room whilst he was waiting for mrs .
you make it sound as though it was measles , said emlyn price .
she mightnt have agreed with you there , said chief-inspector davy .
imagine my childhood .
then , i pray you , eat your breakfast , repose yourself .
one mystery , the mystery of mrs .
another signal passed between the women .
lady stoddart-west broke in quickly : you really do not see what concern it is of mine ?
there were pearls round her neck .
come on , tuppence .
and then the worstfrom mr .
i dont know their telephone number , im afraid , but i know they are a firm on whom he was going to call and they might be able to inform you where he would be likely to be today .
his eye , a militant one , swept over us with a gleam .
i was so interested to hear you were at school with miss blacklock .
and asked for mr .
it is , indeed , necessary that you should .
and the worst of it was that hed never been able to find the house since .
he was looking very white and worried .
you might just as well give me the key , said inspector sharpe .
they too can attain master-hood through suffering and violence and through the considered practice of anarchy .
mother doesnt know who the girls out with , fathers not told who the girl is out with , brothers know who the girl is out with but they think more fool her .
then i do not know why it happened , he said .
nobody ever comes here more than twice on the same racket .
i was there when elizabeth cole and norton found me .
carol speeder was had up before the committee of investigation of un-american activities .
rogers is lying in bed .
emily brewster murmured : winds from the east again .
abbot for that .
i was up in a minute , but the door was already closing behind my late adversary .
he said one day quite ill-temperedly , i believe you prefer that bird to me .
they remained in the little restaurant until eight oclock , when dymchurch suggested a move .
ah , here he was at the post office .
he was to remember it afterwards .
i thought a wash would do me good .
this i would pay for myself .
i got to hear of what he was doing , because in kings abbot you get to hear of everything , but he did not take me into his confidence beforehand .
maybe youre right , said miss ramsbottom , unexpectedly .
good morning , said poirot amiably .
already youre in dangerlook at last night .
you see , im not a clever chap .
even if he had not died , he would , as you express it , have staked you .
a feminine voice from inside the car said , of course its your suitcase , edwin .
but he retired hurt all the same .
oliver being here .
it was an assault of great savagery ?
she was over thirty , and not very good-looking and i dont thinkthere were no scandals about her or anything , but still , one doesnt know .
i mean the highups are worried .
the peacefulness of it comes backthe flagged courtyard , the black snake carved on the wall of the shrine .
after lunch , as poirot was setting himself in his square-backed armchair with his coffee at his elbow , the telephone rang .
he may have shown that side of himself only to her .
crozier ?
the inspector ripped out an oath .
for only one person could have hidden it there .
albert riddell and was of a highly different character .
poirot examined it carefully ; then he said quietly : yesthat is it .
that seems rather a lot , doesnt it ?
all those things .
how many servants do you keep , madame ?
my meditations were interrupted .
i do remember definitely .
so lovely to have a family of my own .
and the ss were used to death .
the train !
that reminded him of something .
she said : i think youll find , charles , that i can look after myself .
i said to miss pierce that perhaps she drank !
' ' i see .
going across to lucia , she took the younger woman by the arm and propelled her towards the settee .
a queer little girl .
did martha want to shield that guilty party ?
well , i decided that id best come clean .
trefusis was left staring after him .
weyman sayshe says the house was built about _num_ or thereabouts .
again , the hesitation was palpable in his tone , i dont know exactly .
oh , it seemed so wonderful that father was really coming home .
josephine turner said shortly : yes .
everyone seems to think it was sad that he should have done so .
i want that needle !
the chambermaid was a woman of thirty , brisk , efficient and intelligent .
you havent mentioned your mother very often but i did gather that shes always done everything she could for you .
and miss arundell was actually taken ill at the seance ?
ruthless , determined to have your own way , quite without pity or kindliness or the rudiments of compassion .
you know , tommy , with everyone talking at once its all muddled up .
ii she had taken the oath .
thats vurry kind and delicate of you .
it is possible , georges , that i may have to go even further .
you worked so hard earlier in the summer .
then you think theres actually something in these wildcat tales ?
swettenham was crossing the hall .
poirot , is occasioned by the fact that my father , for the first time for at least twenty years , is late for dinner .
clearly , said mr .
catherine .
there was a possibility , of course , he said .
queried bobby .
last night , madam , said japp .
her fingers wandered .
it was you who werent satisfied , mr .
perhaps everyone does .
and your moustache .
shed taken it with her to leave at a clock-repairing shop not far from the bureau .
what did she call out , up there , before she fell ?
what was her manner ?
i forebore to pander to his conceit by asking the obvious question .
the something , whatever it was , was back .
you mustnt be angry , but ive told bill about our little stunt .
there would be suggestions , no doubt , of worry or of sleeplessness nick moved uneasily .
are you very busy , sir ?
treves ?
and as my friend said , nothing exciting or remarkable would ever happen to either of them , though they might quite likely travel half over the world .
do get it for metheres an angel .
been out gallivanting ?
just six months ago .
mr parkers mental processes did not seem very rapid .
what i am willing to pay for is a young lady with sufficient intelligence and presence of mind to sustain her part well , and also one who will have sufficient discretion not to ask too many questions .
george lorrimer ?
on the other hand , the articles that were recovered were those of least value .
i went out in the streets quite dazed .
shall i ?
ring up dr .
as i looked at it clemency came down the stairs and through the open door at the bottom .
shiny chintz on the chairs and settees .
lord mayfield looked at him in somewhat astonished inquiry .
he says that most victorians have .
oh , yes , she enjoyed herself thoroughly .
there are men of that type , men outwardly sane , but who decoy girlssometimes childrenaway and kill them .
eustace is doing latin with him in the schoolroom .
she certainly did not seem at all taken aback when you pointed out she could not have seen jane wilkinsons face , i remarked thoughtfully .
for a few moments there was a constrained silence .
george might killas the cornered rat kills .
you two had nothing in common .
can you suggest to me any person who is likely to have such a deep grudge against marina gregg that they would be willing to do away with her ?
your opal , miss nunn ?
what you say is perfectly reasonable .
scared , i said to myself .
could mr .
a dress business ?
so you are here at wadi halfa , he remarked thoughtfully .
it was about three months after the wireless had been installed that the first eerie happening occurred .
i may have more questions to ask you later .
franoise shrugged her shoulders .
the lady , for instance , who called to see colonel protheroe the night before he died .
here is a young man whom i care for and who cares for me .
i worked for ten or eleven hours a day , opening every room , and carrying things around .
but were usually right about our own sex .
inspector japp doesnt seem to agree with you , richard observed .
first she must find this jimmy thesiger .
ransome who had the practice before dr .
miss rowan and miss blake were here .
it sprawls out on the east side of the mound , and has a kitchen , a livingand dining-room , a small office , a workroom , a drawing office , a large store and pottery room , and a minute darkroom (we all sleep in tents) .
i enjoy life , mr .
' ' look here , poitot , ' i cried , ' this really is a bit thick .
of course you dont know what it is to be old .
one of them mended a fuse for me .
quietly , deftly , poirot went about his search .
she telephoned to the house agents , despatched wires abroad , and wrote busily on her typewriter .
no , he didnti got there just before dinner .
well , lots of words end in w .
no , im sure he hasnt .
poirot said , you mean mademoiselle de bellefort ?
i know a little about flowers .
jefferson cope has , consequently , not the least idea what people are really like .
she said : thats not quite true .
' he tapped the family portrait on the wall with his fingernail .
there is nothing i wish to take with meexcept one thing he smiled , and suddenly the smile altered his face and made a different person of him .
anyhow , it landed up about ten yards farther than it should have done .
a long shuddering sigh escaped mrs .
it always boils down to money , does it ?
the sooner i get out of here can someone telephone for a taxi ?
he worried , the weather was cold , he caught a bad chill , and double pneumonia developed .
he produced a bottle proudly .
he spoke the last words with a sinister relish .
bought by an american lady , the stall keeper thinksbut id say thats just a guess .
not definitely .
whenah !
he was a clever fellow , abner .
he was very clever .
good morning , macdonald .
mayfield frowned a little in the effort of remembrance .
i know , alex , i know .
van snyder was hauled from her place of repose .
hemming rose .
poirots hand flew swiftly to a dramatic salute .
looks half batty to my mind .
now dont start thinking of it , i told her .
but i think , all the same , that shed have been better for him than caroline .
it might be both , suggested bobby .
hes a great hebrew and aramaic scholar , you know .
and now at last her revenge has come .
not pretty , perhaps , said mr .
so henry must die too-and the sooner the better- but his death must take place ajer anthony ' s , and at the same time george mu , st have an alibi .
suggested race .
even later in life , going down the village to do a little marketing , she would come back with something extraordinary that had occurred or something somebody had said .
ferrier was all right .
in old days the public didnt really mind so much about accuracy , but nowadays readers take it upon themselves to write to authors on every possible occasion , pointing out flaws .
it has been done , said poirot .
she listened .
and its difficult , went on jane wilkinson .
he looked ill and worn .
you have reasonyou have reason .
that nasty woman sent us there , and the farmers wife was cruel to us , and you wouldnt help usthree little blind mice .
he held a secret of mine , that man who is dead .
he kept repeating that .
so we are back at the old problem , i said .
it was not intended to be .
oh no she wouldnt .
holborn _num_ .
he looked at nadine .
that the thing turned out differently is only a proof of what i was saying just nowthe uncertainty and unreliability of the effects of drugs on human beings .
and the big , handsome policeman will not let you go ?
after that came shirley tower .
i agree it is not a very pleasant thing to have to do but i am quite willing to do it if you think it might be a help to you .
and of course it can be extracted from ordinary tobacco .
i couldnt say as to that , but its for sale only .
but if youd had my experience , superintendent , youd know that case history shows the impossibility of prognosticating accurately .
if in absence they mean nothing to you , and in presence they sweep you off your feet , what is your real reaction ?
this was it !
partners in crime _num_ .
and they are great liars !
father had the income for life , but he couldnt touch the capital .
hes silly about her , said mrs .
the boy hung his head , his fingers began kneading the cloth round his waist .
asked ariadne oliver .
perhaps that was the best way .
rebecca sanseverato , ne arnholt , came to london a disillusioned woman of forty-five .
for the first time , a look of fear sprang into the girls eyes .
jack renauld had been in merlinville on the night of the crime .
your case interests me .
nothing he did was ever illegalbut as soon as hed got on to it , you had to have a law about it , if you know what i mean .
you see , weve only just moved in and its not very good for pianos , being moved into houses and things .
it was said of colonel pikeaway that his eyes were always just closing in sleep , or just opening after sleep .
what a night !
tuppence withdrew to a suitable spot .
he is safe , madame , he is unharmed .
but this , sir joseph looked at him cunningly , is a very small matter .
then there was an indeterminate story of a revolver shot fired here in borodene mansionsand another tale of flick-knives and bloodstains .
if you will be kind enough to do so , mr .
clement , said miss cram .
we must begin at the beginning .
oliver against battle and race .
well think of something .
but she wanted to act fairly .
he led the way into the dining room and pointed to the left-hand wall .
' ' eh ?
but i do not think that infection could be carried that way .
fingerprints on the pistol those of mr .
to hear her moaning out the bloodthe blood was really something .
i dont know him , said elvira .
i wish she hadnti didnt want to go on hearing about her .
it was a case the doctor was specially interested in ?
all experience is valuable .
there was no compulsion on miss carlisle to do this ?
for kait gentleness and submission brought her all she desireda husband and children .
oh yes , i think hes buried right here .
actually , though , she warned you against it ?
my life was now settled for me .
oh , not the kind of good-bye youre thinking of .
the streets , as tommy had said , were crowded , and progress was slow .
you realize what youre doing , i hope , i jerked out .
when the news came out that the master was dead we were struck all of a heap .
so i should imagine , i said .
his hopes were high .
i came down to the pantry and cut some sandwiches .
what exactly is it you are driving at , angell ?
your master was in to lunch ?
i havent seen youlet me see since the night at the bells and motley , said the other quietly .
at the same time i stole a quick glance at poirot .
he wondered about two other thingswhat stephen meant by psychologically speaking and whether stephen could possibly have seen gina from his seat at the piano .
it is the official solution , liq .
and one has so many ailments .
of course i rememberbut ive never connected it with that particular day .
im going to be gay and enjoy myself .
that was natural , i think , eh , mademoiselle ?
hubbard was shocked .
ronny stared at him .
there lives there then , mr .
with a shaking hand i pointed at the window .
finally he perused it twice .
mr sellons partner who lives in london is a woman , she explained to her friends .
damn that girl , thought craddock unamiably .
it was from john lane , the bodley head , and it asked if i would call at their office in connection with the manuscript i had submitted entitled the mysterious affair at styles .
he turned deferentially to the american ambassador .
i had done all i couldpray heaven poirot would read the sign aright .
well , im glad thats been cleared up .
as for your hair , i will take you to this armenian girl tonight .
frances sighed .
can you give me revenge upon my enemies ?
when he had gone i waited a minute or two and then crept to the tower room door .
three nasty old cat , said griselda , as soon as the door was closed .
she doesnt sayshe doesnt saywell , not whether she cares for me or not ?
the same tune that mr .
youre very sensible , too .
mary said : would you like to go back ?
a young lady .
they entered the dark aperture first , the others close on their heels .
strength came to them as they stood there , clasped together in the darkness .
luke quickened his pace , looking about him with sudden exasperation .
said some american visitor had turned up unexpectedly and she couldnt leave home .
occasionally he nodded his head ; once he shook it .
it was amusing to see marie arrive when we were playing downstairs in the evening , an apron tied round her waist , saying politely , monsieur toni pour le bain .
poirot will tell me what to do .
she was pretty young when i left home .
tell celia to buck up , he said over his shoulder .
the railway journeys they took were few and far between .
it was a large room with a gleaming expanse of parquet floor on which were dotted expensive oriental rugs .
it is odd .
especially before breakfast , is it not ?
oh , lord , miss , the drains is all right !
blore , who had joined them , dressed , but still unshaved , said : wheres miss brent got tothats another mystery ?
he was given to ungovernable rages , was a monomaniac on the subject of family pride , and had a bee in his bonnet in more ways than one .
_num_ for you , the room you had last time .
max !
i see the news hasnt got to you yet .
thats what he said .
theyre upset because lettice protheroe said she didnt dust properly .
then that is not feasible .
still , she has never thought of refusing to accept the legacy ?
you were not dreaming .
abernethie himself (here poirot gave a hard stare at timothy) to look amongst the pictures in miss gilchrists room and select the one of polflexan harbour on pretext of having it reframed as a surprise for miss gilchrist .
then youll answer civil questions civilly .
this possibility was confirmed by a further circumstance .
dear cousin letty (it said) , i hope it will be all right for me to come to you on tuesday ?
tell him to bring the things out this way .
my sister marys children .
i do , mr .
shes practically a half-wit , as far as i can make out .
the unexpected .
an idiot of a steward woke me up in the middle of the night to return me that roll of films i dropped yesterday .
i never think of money .
wilfred was such a relief after charles .
co , castor oil .
she seemed to speak every language with ease .
things about posters and carters little liver pills .
six months later i was in los angeles , and i noticed the fellow again .
what was the point of that question about the glasses ?
whether theyre innocent or guilty .
i have lived in the world long enough , m .
that seems very unlike joyce .
you do not take the trouble to go out on your balcony and hurl it into the sea !
youll take care of me , jinks ?
down the steep track into the village a car was coming .
sir bartholomew strange .
the kilmorden castle sails on saturdayquite a good boat .
i handed them back to her .
perhaps i could have a few minutes private conversation ?
those digitalin leaves were deliberately mixed with the sage , knowing what the result would be .
the door opened and diana cleves , the lytcham roches adopted daughter , came into the room .
but i wasnt going to be out of it and let those three men have all the fun to themselves .
women apparently can .
she got very opinionated about certain things .
leidner and i didnt hit it off particularly well .
the contrast between the two women struck me at once , the more so as in actual features and colouring they were not unalikebut oh , the difference !
what earthly reason could lawrence have for killing colonel protheroe ?
thats what my mother always used to say to me , m .
he had minor worries , like most men , but there was nothing of a serious nature .
nofret has jeered at me , laughed at me ; treated me as a child .
i say , isnt that captain trevelyans house ?
well , well leave you in if you like , said japp good-temperedly .
i was all the more firm because i secretly agreed with some part , at least , of what she had said .
victoria sped on .
entwhistle looked at him keenly .
he nodded vigorously .
the schoolmistress here is a most unpleasant young woman , she said .
he insisted on opening the second dooryou knowthe one thats never been openedthe one over there .
profitable financiallybut nothing else .
many children , most children , i should say , suffer from overattention on the part of their parents .
i was working on some cuneiform tablets in my own room .
only , and there was the tragedy , that warmth of heart had not really been for him .
he chatted pleasantly for a few minutes more , then he mercifully departed .
jefferson , but these gentlemen arefrom the police .
her reply came to him faintly from the depths .
find anything else ?
i think what i meant was that we hadnt been able to grow up independent , standing by ourselves , upright .
emily wasted no time .
casey .
he was passing the kitchen window , when he heard dinsmeads words from within , and the words attracted his attention immediately .
floras face had gone very white .
she looked up at him for a moment or two without answering .
he had not , he was quite sure , written anything there himself .
he picked it up and examined it .
extremely curious , muttered poirot .
upon that she was gone , an impetuous whirlwind , her errand accomplished .
so there must be another reason for the destruction of the rucksackand to destroy a rucksack , i may say , is not an easy thing .
time does go so fast .
why didnt you bring gerry over with you ?
i was the first one to come backyes .
bartlett , said the superintendent .
a sick beating at ones heart .
sugden considered the point .
i know the babbingtons are not like that .
poirot drew up her chair and sat down near jacqueline .
anthony marston dies of asphyxiation or choking last night after dinner , and mother rogers oversleeps herself with a vengeance .
good job here ?
standing there , filling my pipe , i heard partridge enter the dining room from the hall and heard her voice say grimly : can i speak to you a minute , miss ?
the butler reappeared and , crossing the floor , said in a discreet voice : if you wouldnt mind waiting a short time , sir , the doctor will see you , but hes very busy this morning .
just come back from the east , i hear ?
she didnt object to the idea ?
at one minute i have no secretaries , at another i have too many .
make a fuss , i expect , said ellie , in her placid way .
and stay at the same hotel ?
round one had gone to britain .
he eliminated lavinia pinkerton and although one woman was sharp enough to spot his number no one believed her .
then shed not want to risk messing a new frock and shed put on an old one .
here we were , with a full itinerary , and enjoying london and all our plans made and my passage booked .
faithful to the tradition of juliet , victoria leaned over the balcony and gave a prolonged hiss .
ive got a little money besides my pension .
and why was she suddenly so keen to go to america ?
cayley plunged triumphantly on , his voice rising and falling in pleasurably melancholy cadences , only interrupted when he paused to receive the silk muffler his wife brought him and wind it round his throat .
no economy over me , if you please !
there were traffic lights at the end of the road and a public house , the queens necklace , at the corner .
howard raikes had said with a faint sneer : so you always go to church , mr .
and then perhaps a picture would rise , unsought : the deck of a shipbut not a real shipa ship curtailed by hanging curtains of thick rich materiala man , charles cartwright , standing on that deck , light that was not sunlight streaming down on him , the hands half clenched , the easy gait and a voicethe easy pleasant voice of an english sailor and gentleman , a great deal magnified in tone .
vexed , she was at first .
a rather interesting medley of drugslsd giving vivid dream sequencesnightmares or pleasurable .
according to plan , he said softly .
she need only be absent from her typewriter for about twenty minutes .
married woman .
ancient novels , old text books , odds and ends of all kinds , labelled _num_ d .
she had progressed beyond the nursery governess and was now seeking information about the matron at pauls preparatory school .
a good family .
it is doubtful that any of the five books would still be available today if it werent for the career of the famous belgian of the little grey cells or the elderly inhabitant of st .
ill come with you , said emily .
i looked at him , said the clerk who was telling us this , and i saw at once what he meant .
that , too , was why she was able to accept the truth too easily , without doubt or hesitation .
it was about the masters build , sirbut i never thought of it being him .
they want to talk about oil .
by all acknowledged standards frank oliver ought to have felt rebuffed , but it is a regrettable sign of his rapid advance in depravity that he merely murmured to himself : little darling !
' ' facing the window .
it was terrible , m .
but i dont want to see him hanged for all that .
they watched him , fascinated .
a man with a certain ruthlessness .
not so , you think , would an english inquiry be conducted .
she went round to look at her partners hand .
she had been kneeling , tying a stake against one of the small fruit trees .
yes , i will do that .
it would be interesting to hear what everyone has to say about it .
i didnt want her here .
yet when i tried the switch it was in perfect working order .
i shuddered .
yes of course dreadful for you most natural yes , nursing homes are like that of course you must be .
but the pier was blown up in the war , and since aunt coras sketch was done a couple of years ago , it cant very well be from nature , can it ?
poirot , said mrs lacey .
it was clear that she could have gone on in this vein for some time , although it seemed to the inspector that she had already envisaged every possibility , likely or otherwise .
yes , its always the same time every morning .
the doctor was queer to begin with .
iii on her way home , mrs .
yes , indeed , he may have , clarissa agreed .
she admitted to herself that she disliked vivien .
thats the sort of stuff m .
you know , honestly , i think i must have been going queer or something lately .
ive traced that telephone call that you received .
he replaced the spike which fixed it on the door very carefully .
treves smiled .
shell probably be scared to death .
there , it was outdisaster !
he looked up as they entered .
but that was at least twenty minutes or half an hour ago .
to solve any problem one must have the facts .
quick , go to the other wing .
hardcastle murmured , the foreign help at last , and handed her his card .
an action is performedthe action being murderwhat now are the results of that action ?
one , it was done by a vicious-minded young thug , who likes violence for violences sakethere are plenty of them about these days , mores the pity .
cara zia is very important , very important indeed .
it was when we were passing through a village about eight or nine miles away that it happenedthat i saw him , i mean .
and in the opinion of everyone i talked to (with one notable exception) caroline crale was guilty .
so hell appear to be quite bona fide .
i dont often make mistakes , i hope , she said .
) ' then you saw the account of the murder of hem _num_ reedburn , the impresario ?
the next question was not quite so usual , but rowley answered it without much thought .
then he pulled out an envelope .
poirot might choose to sit in a chair , put the tips of his fingers together , and set his grey cells whirring to work while his body reclined comfortably within four walls .
rathbone and presumably dr .
uncle richard was a bit of a stick-in-the-mud where women were concerned .
poirot asked with an air of engaging candour : what do you think yourself of mr .
it was a simple , quickly improvised weapon .
the mill house was really old , and the floors were very uneven .
that is what you are marrying .
richard came back from the french windows , and sat in one of the chairs by the table .
ah yes , thats his nurse-attendant , isnt it ?
he turned to molly .
you think he would have been able to get things out of her ?
did it strike you that there was anything odd about this party of his , miss lessing ?
she was murmuring under her breath : really most extraordinary oh , dear , i shall never get these down in timeand they were nearly dry .
we could do with some help .
he added : i must not keep you , mr .
race said , and that person was ?
poirot asked softly .
easier to throw oneself into that part .
as you know , i open all mr .
i imagine that hed been already approached by agents of our friend , mr .
but miss marple reproved herself for this thoughtwho was she to demand murders made to measure ?
as christian gulbrandsen did .
when the young man had left the room , sir rupert went to the window and unfolded the small slip of paper that had been tucked into the mouth of the pot .
surely you remember , bella , her husband continued .
he read no more .
lousy .
hes rather a dear no , lynn .
mary said slowly : all the same , i shouldnt be surprised if old fortescue hadnt been planning to get him back here .
well now , lets have your point of view .
she gave the name of mrs .
sometimes , when he turned his head , the two behind could see his lips moving .
hes always just on the right side of the law .
rising from the sofa , laura went to a cupboard behind the armchair .
charles departed immediately .
but she believed herself too clever .
they had quite suddenly a twinkle in them .
i always thought john was just wonderful !
a special mixture that i had ordered myself from the army and navy stores in london .
he was the best type of c .
half past three ?
so does nash .
but yesterday he turned up here .
now , if we could find evans how many evanses , bobby interrupted , do you think there are in marchbolt ?
your body is , he said drily .
look here , sir .
that is well , said poirot .
somebody else had said something about paint mr .
it took her a few minutes to fathom what it was .
but the whole position is most unsatisfactory .
clever , said poirot .
this is its official name to baffle laymen with .
the window was open , if i remember rightly ?
she left him .
i never put it there .
letitia was devoted to her sister .
with a deep sigh i proceeded to do things with my hair .
your instances are always apt , georges .
i did , mon ami , said poirot softly .
dearest jim , everythings going to be all right , so cheer up .
lorrimer was saying in her cool , incisive voice .
i say to myself again and againwhat should i do without mrs .
i am shut in there like a rat in a trap .
if any of you has heard or seen anything in the past weekanything that has puzzled you relating to miss springer , anything miss springer may have said or someone else may have said of her that strikes you as at all significant , i should like to know it .
i never disclose my methods beforehand .
im glad i did it !
lettice protheroe , dennis , and all their crowd .
no , we are not sentimental nowadays .
hes got a very brown face and very blue eyes .
of the questions you were posing to yourself , i replied dryly .
you may lock up now .
the nature of the letter made it clear enough what was in prospect .
he added thoughtfully , shes that kind of person .
she would be , i said .
as a matter of fact , mrs bantry , i am .
satterthwaite and said again : you understand ?
it was cheaply but comfortably furnished and it was empty .
but when it came to a yellow face pressed against the windowand when she rushed to the window there was nothing therewell , i ask you , it is a bit creepy for all of us .
gerda took him in deadly earnest .
and such a night as never was , she ended up .
he gave it up at last , shaking his head .
but i dont see how you can get round this one .
i have nothing to conceal , lucia told him defiantly .
quite so , said dr .
quins voice , was pregnant with purpose .
he had told the colonel and the colonel had gone to the morning room directly dinner was over .
they had always loved each other .
you know , i should never be surprised if bits of her turned up in a trunk at margate or somewhere !
i was a witness of your attempt to drown this girl .
i dont hold with wars , said the young man .
this is a very one-horse sort of place .
she said accusingly .
well , going to be free .
a woman stood in the window facing him .
he wasnt a nice kind of man , she said , to say a thing like that to a lady .
bienit shall be as you wish !
shes young and merry .
nothing like having a chat over old days .
amyas said : what do you mean , caroline ?
no really strong man wants a woman .
i shouldnt like anything to happen to you .
i dont know what youre talking about , ernie .
he said : oh yes , he might have them .
if it comes to it , laura , ill take the blame , he assured her .
these murders began miss marple .
for instance , both you and i , without doubt , have said some time or other , theres the post , when what we really meant was that wed heard a double knock and the rattle of the letter-box .
jeremy nodded again .
one will have to go back again .
andanother flashkicking off her shoesbecause her feet hurt .
billi think hes deadhes in the car stillbut he doesnt move or speak .
she did not tell me the real reasonof that i am sure .
she was really , lady matilda thought , quite splendidly hideous .
you wouldnt care for green i suppose , madam ?
said poirot with every appearance of being much gratified .
she was a kind , good woman .
it was not incapacity on his partit was the march of progress .
no , i said explosively .
lots of men dont .
hes not responsible for his acts .
poirot nodded gloomily .
ive given her some aspirin and shes gone to bed .
i mean , i didnt think anyone would be here either .
youre not worrying about anything , are you ?
sir rowland frowned .
can you give me particulars ?
we are going to see a personality .
that is your uncle patrick as a young man , she said .
assuredly not , assuredly not , m .
and how does his family react ?
have you seen anything of her ?
i dreamt too much .
yet i found myself evincing an increasing interest in her .
he said , why isnt tea ready ?
there was sheer amazement in anthonys tone .
hes afraid .
one simple little remarkah , i could kick myself , as you say , all round the town , for not noticing it at the time .
battle laughed .
carl shook his head .
so that filthy letter has done some good , after all !
it doesnt seem like work , said rhoda .
but thenwe shall never know !
' i did go barging about a bit , ' _num_ confessed .
he fussed up to charles agreeably .
i suppose the police will find out .
im afraid i dont quite know what the rough is .
it was an incautious query .
come on , said bobby .
silassilas harper .
never got them .
she may encourage major blunt just as a blind .
on the other hand , it is unlikely that he speaks french well .
attend , i pray .
the telephone and the office boy had done their work .
he took a cigarette and lighted it .
nose , medium ; mouth ordinary (how do they expect you to describe a mouth ?
croft , heartily .
she seemed an extremely nice , wholesome and pleasant woman .
i didnt know anything about it .
after a minute or two he said in a plaintive tone : young man , do you know how they get the water out of a mine ?
stores are holding out , then ?
archie told me all about himself , how he was waiting impatiently to get into the newly-formed royal flying corps .
or is itperhapsbecause you do know ?
the window was open and the fragment of conversation came clearly to their ears .
shaw before , that ellie had suffered from some form of heart malady three or four years ago .
poirot watched keenly for any reaction , but he saw none .
evans will come in due coursethe title is fixed .
thats not whats worrying you .
this is a pleasant surprise .
it seemed to me extremely foolish of him to treat the matter in that way .
uncle richard was so matter-of-fact .
but angell put up with these difficulties , did he ?
quite good country people , said miss russell .
come on , ill show you .
luxmore took out a vanity case and powdered her nosethe spell was broken .
his tone was despondent .
instantly the other detectives ran up , and poured into the house , shutting the door behind them .
a special cake baked for tea .
emily and charles unlatched the gate and walked up the path .
the baker had also brought the papers , and she spread them out on the hall table .
i felt the poor girls hand and it was icy cold .
and sobek , my handsome son , still given to merriness of heart , i see .
i can refer you to him and superintendent sugden held up his hand to stem the flow .
with the utmost care , she couldnt have lived longer than two months at the outside .
chapman , but its quite possible that harm was done .
one of the fivers jack argyle had on him was definitely one that had been given to mrs .
what sort of job is it ?
now even the vicar , who had declared that killing the detested protheroe would be doing the world at large a favour , is a suspectthe colonel has been dispatched in the clergymans study , no less .
then mary said , her face flushing : miss elinor , you mustnt think she stopped , warned by the sudden stiffening of elinors slender figure , the uplifted line of her chin .
she is wearing beige silk stockings and brown glac strap shoes .
now what can i do for you ?
clever , isnt it ?
cecil ?
oh , she is , said mrs .
what do you meanthe opposite ?
he told him .
omurphy slows up .
pinkerton .
i put it to you that what you really said was : i have left the morphia at home .
people have gone about saying the unkindest thingsthat she schemed for this money to be left her !
at the same moment , mrs .
its a yorkshire terriermy dogmy very own dog .
it was almost as though he did not care for poirots amiable acquiescence .
she was in her old clothes again but she had managed to make them look different .
certainly , miss carlisle .
there was a knock at the door , and the waiter entered with a small table and the accessories of the meal .
you will go to the police .
emily brent said sharply : ive never met anyone called owen in my life .
after he left he sent me a little gold teddy bear brooch .
john and has concussion .
all the dollars were made for my little girland now shes gone , ill spend my last cent to catch the damned scoundrel that did it !
that heart of his may go outphutany moment .
yer couldnt a done nothin .
my poor hastings !
poirot , hes cleverer than ever .
he was in london , yes .
what she did know and took for granted was a fairly limited slice of humanity .
she looked down at the dead man .
miss marple tells a story i dont think ive ever told you , my dearsyou , raymond , and you , joan , about the rather curious little business that happened some years ago now .
his keen , shrewd eyes looked across at poirot .
daresay hes in a funk in case she should get to hear of it , sir .
damned dangerous things , mushrooms .
she was quick-witted enough to tell you when you asked her , that sonia was small and dark and she took the old snapshots out of the album so that you shouldnt notice any resemblance at the same time as she removed snapshots of letitia herself .
he missed what inspector bland had been saying and only heard the end of his speech .
his eyes dropped as they met mine , and he blinked .
tredwell had entered the room while poirot was speaking .
ill think about it , i said .
going out to see it again this afternoon .
by the age of seventeen or eighteen , however , i was doing better .
ii looking into the kitchen with a word of admonition , lanscombe was snapped at by marjorie , the cook .
no , its not ralph .
but as regards any abnormal influence , i should give it a clean bill of health .
but instead we have giuseppe and pierre and they just dont fit .
you can borrow lady westholmes shoe-cleaning apparatus , said sarah unkindly .
and so you see , mr .
the evidence of the passengers luggage part three : hercule poirot sits back and thinks _num_ .
i really cant think began mrs .
oh , heshes just someone .
poirot and i had , of course , already seen it .
theres a lot of silly slop like that .
ellis did not reply .
he darted a quick look at her .
he opened the door and went out into the hall .
poirot murmured with an apparent quickening of interest : apples ?
felicie stared for a moment .
this is my friend greta andersen .
superintendent spence sighed .
it was fear .
but that morning after patting a little brilliantine on to the smooth flaxen cap of her hair , she had handled the briefcase .
after ive seen laverton-west , well go and see him .
before i knew where i was we were standing on the platform , bareheaded and minus our valises , whilst the train disappeared into the night .
if i understand the arrangement of this murder hunt correctly , when the girl heard anyone approaching the door she was to lie down and enact the part of the victim , and wait to be discovered by the person who had found the last cluethe key .
peters .
if these boys were sent to gaol at once it would perhaps warn them off that type of life .
we have not been able to find any such circumstances possible .
thats just what i dont know .
he stepped back across the room .
i suppose i had better display the goods .
reilly with some impatience .
a doctor has certain powers .
were they drugged ?
i am pressed for time , goby .
though , i daresay , he remarked as he settled down in a chair , that they suffered a good deal from woman trouble .
' the girl shrugged her shoulders .
has she realized and resented amyass desertion of her sister ?
after a brief but vivid interest in zoroastrianism , she returned , much to my fathers relief , to the safe haven of the church of england , but with a preference for high churches .
she glanced at the pale blue enamel watch that she wore pinned to one side of her dress .
perhaps not for you , sidi , since you are valuable .
its the most natural thing in the world that when im at medenham i should come on here to stay with bunch for a little .
now that nofret was dead everything was all right .
youd better all go for a walk this afternoon , she said with unexpected amiability .
it is destroying the old one that you will enjoy .
i accompanied him a short way along pall mall , before we parted .
you will excuse me , sir .
then when she came to herself , she may have realised what shed done and gone down to the river and drowned herself .
one does not say these things over the telephone , said poirot .
and thats only the beginning .
they dont like you to notice thingsespecially if it should seem you were telling them off about it .
masterton had left , poirot went out and strolled through the woods .
dabord , he said , we will advertise in the papers .
beside him , he heard mrs .
she looked at them , almond-eyed and demure .
now for the second contact from abroad , dr .
i saw you !
and the bundle of letters ?
the doom was to come upon heather .
but i agree with you , my dear boy , that jason rudd really cares with all his heart for marina gregg .
her health is poor , and i suppose it naturally makes her a little inconsiderate of other peoples feelings , but it does not seem to occur to her that her family might like occasionally to go on excursions without her .
frank oliver laughed once sardonically , and threw the letter into the fire .
as far as i knew , nannie had never seen me , but she said at once : its mr .
i mean , it was general ravenscrofts own revolver that was used , i understand .
there was a certain impulsiveness in his manner which reminded me of his mother .
have we any evidence to show that madame renauld loved the tramp ?
i knew paul renauld .
he said slowly : ive seen it somewhere , yes , but i cant remember where .
well , so long .
the wall lights had been turned out .
oh , im glad to hear that .
after a little trouble , with the exercise of good-humoured pertinacity , he obtained an interview with amelia hill , cook-housekeeper to the late anthony gascoigne .
it is copied from modern magazinesfrench , german , italian .
asked tuppence suspiciously .
there had been awe in rosaleens , its a wonderful house .
highbrow ones , i bet .
the younger was supervising the process .
these women who have children when theyre over forty never seem to learn any sense .
colgate nodded .
it must have given you a terrible shock , said edward sympathetically .
bobby sighed , teed his ball , reteed it , waggled his club a long time , took back stiffly , shut his eyes , raised his head , depressed his right shoulder , did everything he ought not to have doneand hit a screamer down the middle of the course .
george bowed and departed , while poirot slowly finished his cup of chocolate and then repaired to the balcony with that mornings newspaper .
besides , if gerald lee were to divorce his wifeand clare had no doubts at all that that was exactly what he would do , he was a man with an almost fanatical view of his own honourthenwell , the way would lie open for gerald to come to her .
but that , said poirot , is where i come in .
in the other corner max was fully exposed to a deluge .
incidents of the aristocracy were frequently on nursies lips .
i suppose so , agreed simone listlessly .
ginevra , youre tired , youd better go to bed .
maude abernethie and gregory banks spoke almost in unison .
that brings us up against two possibilities .
miss williams was in the schoolroom part of the morning correcting some exercise books .
you know the general idea .
most of the rich people ive known have been fairly miserable .
that suggests something to you ?
she lay tossing from side to side , seeing always that flower-like face with the horror-stricken eyes .
big enough for a person to hide in ?
its a primitive form of same .
good looking , of course , and with a certain specious power of argument .
and i shall be there myself later in the day .
but heretommydo you remember ostend ?
i think ill have to make you a gardener .
inquired charles casually .
as it happens , i have business in london of an urgent nature .
it looks like murder , does it not ?
' ' did he usually receive visitors in his own room ?
you know what you want to know now , i suppose .
my brother wilhelm is associated with me in this venture .
something of great value , mr .
something that greta said , it annoyed me and i answered sharply back .
the young fellow rather interests me .
what she thinks , what she feels , that i do not know .
again he drew his papers towards him and started reading them but his mind was not on what he was doing .
she bore her losses well , with the stoical sang froid of the old habitu .
footsteps were heard on the stairs .
quite so , acquiesced poirot .
that is what you believeand to put it a little differently , that is what i hope .
its a great thing to be a married man .
quite so , said japp , dexterously stopping the flow .
im no good at description .
i dont think its strictly necessary .
what hands you had for a horse .
is it a gang ?
and i could love eustace , only hes always such a beast to me and wont be interested in finding out who did all this .
and the matter was so simple , really .
hardly ever , nowadays , do you hear of an eva .
i certainly assumed , from what lady tressilian occasionally let fall , that she had left me something .
his hands shook , he swallowed , his calm unemotional face seemed distorted by pain .
it was his temper let him down .
' lord mayfield made a movement of dissent , but poirot spoke before he could .
really serious not justified too big a responsibility to take we should , perhaps , take outside advice finally miss marple heard christian gulbrandsen say , ach , it grows cold .
i have stayed with him for a weekend occasionally , and our relations were perfectly amicable , though his views remained unaltered .
yes she went to pieces .
neil cream .
but funnily enough , as it burned it curled over towards me and i just saw that there were words written in ink on the paper .
not at all , mademoiselle .
come in .
ten minutes later caroline tapped at the door and entered .
you neednt be quite so lifelike as to bring the police into it .
youll be darned lonesome , you poor kid .
she wants to hear where that thing there was all the fuss about was hidden , dont you ?
we hopedof course one always hopesbut i dont think rosalind , in her own heart , ever did quite hope .
jeremy looked as though he was about to say something , but sir rowland held up a hand , and went on , once the police are satisfied that costello isnt in this house , theyll go off and look elsewhere .
i went back to my first attemptand i realised that it was not going to be nearly long enough for a novel .
but a murder is different .
the cuthbertsons were here and the redlands , and before that the seymours .
she looked sort of dazed .
on a table , amongst her own cosmetic boxes and jars , was the little jewel case that had belonged to nofret .
nevertheless , after the most infinitesimal of pauses , she shook her head .
but the door was locked !
she was dressed that evening in floating scarlet chiffon that dragged on the floor .
i wish you wouldnt make it so clear you dont like nevile .
schuster , and waited for more .
d ' you know , old horse , up to the very last minute i thought you- were leading up to some subtle theory of highfalutin ' psychological " suggested " murder ?
jinny ?
victoria let the beads of her rosary pass through her fingers .
every precaution will be taken every precaution !
hilda lee said quietly : that is an infamous suggestion .
i shall travel a little first .
i suppose that i was preparing to have a picnic lunch .
it is the most obvious idea .
he would pull out the drawers and ransack the rooms to give the appearance of robbery , he might hide the money outside , cunningly , to incriminate james bentley , the money that was in the savings bank was what he was after .
several people keep mentioning it .
what did your uncle say ?
who has not ?
she gave a sudden , quick shiver .
i thought maybe carolyou see , there was the mark on her wrist poirot said quickly : that is the one point on which i am not completely informed .
monsieur renauld , she raised her head from her hands and gazed at him wonderingly .
he owes his position entirely to his wife .
that im u .
i will not give you the key !
why would anyone return them to you that wayin the middle of the night ?
the milk jug had slopped over because it was over-full .
dont show yourselves at the windows , but when we drive up , let us in at once .
and then comes mitziyet another danger .
pleased to meet you , she replied , robustly .
im sorry ive been so frightfully stupid .
i said , puzzled .
with kameni at your side you will feel protected , said imhotep .
syringing an ear was a highly technical thing , said the sister .
mrs clapperton talked of her own he .
i hardly see , then , what more there is to say .
what made you change your mind about drinking it ?
hes frightfully distinguishedstrings of letters after his name .
but surely her maid the maid has disappeared .
she was more than afraidshe was terrified .
a puff of wind caught at her battered felt hat , causing it to sit even more rakishly than it had done before .
and find it quickly .
of course i couldnt agree to that .
of course , your fee and expenses i mean er , thatll be all right , of course i comprehend perfectly , said poirot , but for the moment it is neither my fee nor my expenses which interests me .
he replaced the putter in his bag and took out the niblick .
and a young woman with a big camera taking photographs .
could dr .
there are two of my men handyfishing in the dinghy there .
did you fly ?
thats funny , she said .
nobody else ever thought of it .
rather swamped by female society , eh , bletchley ?
i saybut dont apologize .
twenty-three the evidence of a pair of silk stockings as superintendent battles train rushed eastwards through england , anne meredith and rhoda dawes were in hercule poirots sitting room .
why do you want me to do it ?
poirot was silent for a minute or two , then he said in quite a different tone of voice : you are sure it was a man , mademoiselle ?
im very grateful to you , my lord , and to mr .
jeff has always been such a sensible , levelheaded old boy .
miss marple said gently : youve had a good deal of unhappiness , havent you , my dear ?
all right , said frankie .
after that , as my feet are a little damp , and i have sneezed twice , i shall return to my rooms and make myself a tisane over the spirit lamp !
of course its all nonsense , and it doesnt mean anything !
you have no illusions , i see , about your future brother-in-law .
poirot waved a hand .
father lavigny , she said .
it is certain ?
the old man took us straight to what was clearly a prison , and we were led into a heavily barred cell with our luggage , sitting demurely in the middle of it .
perhaps he had left some record .
good night , chre madame .
no , sir , we work it together .
we had no time to go into that .
a servant might have read the letters out of curiosity , though it seemed unlikelycertainly unlikely that she should have gone to the trouble of finding a key to fit the box .
murder is stupid .
i see your point of view , said craddock , but forgive me , isnt there one aspect that you are neglecting ?
i told them he wasnt drunkthat it was concussion and you treated him after that .
and when he is found dead , what happens ?
i remember particularly because it was the day when that sad accident happened .
parker pyne explained his remark .
her chance was gone for the moment , but if she was careful not to arouse his suspicions , it would come again later .
good old yorkshire .
roberts debated his own costume .
send up your cardyou have a card ?
no , no , not that .
why are you telling me this ?
he was doing a tour through the states .
and yetit fits in .
now if that someone had come over from alderbury it could not have been philip blake , nor elsa greer , nor amyas crale nor caroline crale .
i thought it was just me being maternal .
inglethorps tonic .
quin to you .
youll have to get rid of that woman , he said .
for a moment poirot became his old self .
wellyou seeaunt lettythe fact of the matter isi can explain it alli know i oughtnt to have done itbut it really seemed more of a lark than anything else .
he did all the repairs and the roof and painting and things like that .
flattered by the ladys interest , he had displayed to her the famous ruby in its new setting , and had finally been so unwise as to accede to her request to be allowed to wear it just for one evening !
poirots smile broadened .
first ruby keene and now this child , pamela reeves .
there was a faint stir in the room .
its just possible that you might be useful to me , m .
he shook his head gently in a slightly reproving manner .
he broke off at this point to ask sergeant hay : they dont take marmalade out of the pot and put it into fancy pots ?
and we both thought it very odd .
do you know one thing that strikes me about all this ?
lorrimer , to dr .
pretty place .
iv the bell pealed aggressively .
we inherited what money there was but it wasnt very much .
alfreds always been as jealous as hell of me .
always the chivalrous pukka sahib .
lawrence followed him , and mrs .
did she , linnet , feel like that about windlesham ?
cautiously i crept down it .
stuffed birds removed from the museum owing to the moth having attacked them , stacks of torn magazines and a room whose shelves were covered with out-of-date works of fiction and childrens books .
naturally , said miss marple .
his face was scarlet .
poor dora , poor pretty silly fluffy dora .
oh yes , were still there .
somebody well-known and popular or ill eat my boots !
twenty-four the monkeys paws i gwenda leaned her elbows on the table and cupped her chin in her hands while her eyes roamed dispassionately over the remains of a hasty lunch .
, though even that perhaps might have been a bit remote .
i never felt any desperation as to whether i could think of one more book to write .
on his return to the office a call came through for him on the telephone .
thats all very well for some people , but we attract class here .
she asked me if id come with them when they moved , and i said i would .
getting on for fiftywomen do go a bit queer at that age .
i said to myself .
now for the other two .
ah , but you see , i am coming to a fact that you do not know as yet .
it was only a minor victory , since beneath the surface the bindweed remained in possession as always .
i paused , waiting for what he would tell me .
lee would see me .
miss brent said coldly : there is no question of defence .
a major ellerby , sir poirot took the words out of his mouth .
she turned from the window and looked at herself in the full-length mirror that hung on the wall where the staircase turned .
pilaff de homar and grilled chicken for me , he murmured .
ahthis businessit goes all wrong .
my god , said mr .
by that time , said inspector craddock , eccles and the man who calls himself edwin moss were on his trail .
midge gave a faint shiver and said : well , at any rate , its over now .
its a clue !
and what makes you think that ?
such people are not always accountable for their actions .
but have no fear , dereek .
his cuffs had been stained with blood , and he had burned them in the kitchen stove .
i believe that he keeps a tame one which is trained to bite pieces out of the boat on occasions .
bantry put down the telephone receiver with a sigh of annoyance .
he hates me now .
glynne was standing , looking up at her anxiously .
and your interview was quite amicable ?
the uniform would be left in a conspicuous place so as to show clearly just how the trick had been played .
never had the gift of the gab .
he was clever , of courseeveryone said he was brilliantin his work , i mean .
push her a bit , george .
it was a letter , said mrs .
she would have been quite incapable of remembering or taking an interest in anything affecting anyone else .
but of course shes very young still .
he nodded slowly .
wh , .
little fool .
and so , because of my silencethat poor silly child was killedand after her , dear old merdellwhere would it have ended ?
the man seemed to have an extraordinary knack of appearing out of space without the least warning .
black bess was always ticking off patricias beloved nigel , putting him right , you know , when he made silly statements in the way he does sometimes .
they do click horribly , said griselda .
the womans air of severity redoubled .
then her one idea was to get you both out of the way .
more time , more time .
reckless disregard of human life ?
weve looked all over the boat , sir .
he left a wife in england .
it is important to realise this early in life , and very good for you .
i do not say that you are not right , madame .
he is in paris .
in a few moments raynor returned with two whiskies and sodas on a tray .
then there was mrs .
i dont know as i ought to but seeing its you , m .
i thought you were working up to something exciting .
i hear they havent found out who did it yet .
shell be leaving school next year .
and now what about this story of yours , mrs .
said madeleine fiercely .
hm , i said , theres nothing much to go by .
flora ackroyd is , of course , no relation whatever really to ralph paton but ralph has been looked upon for so long as practically ackroyds own son , that cousinship is taken for granted .
ive answered all your questions .
you were there when the chief inspector made that monstrous suggestion the other day ?
oh , im delighted to see you , mrs .
you know , his methods were to me very interesting .
he added : and i dont think ill be coming back , either .
i make the sign of the horns every time when he looks my way .
especially i dont like the chocolates having so little arsenic in them .
youve forgotten , laura reminded him .
see here , my man , my name is inspector verall of scotland yard , and ive got a warrant for the arrest of your master .
i must get on with my letters .
nonot really .
the question was careless but his eyes were keen and attentive .
she married franklin because she expected him to have a brilliant career .
yes , he came to me .
she may have taken a russian name , but he knows well enough that she is italian .
thats so , isnt it , sir ?
this was to be dr campbell-thompsons final season .
what madness !
she turned towards me , and gasped out : alfredalfred could the strychnine have been administered in mrs .
your observation , too , it was very just , said poirot , turning to mr .
inspector slack turned a slow suspicious stare upon me , and i felt hot all over .
ackroyd , his finger on the sheet to turn it over , paused .
he added : hes been here this afternoon .
that would hurtthat would hurt terribly .
i think hes just a rotter .
man fell over the cliff .
for the moment there was nothing to be done , and she walked obediently into mrs .
a very nice quiet gentleman , mr .
miss marple gave a sudden exclamation .
theyre all alike !
very cheap .
and what else ?
stephen farr took it .
its not odd at all , said miss marple .
depend upon it , he was murdered in that house .
poirot blinked slightly .
i gather as much , i said .
such a small quantity , it would seembut enough to be worth thousands of pounds to those willing to pay for it .
its got to go for one day , thats all , said helen .
i thought youd love it .
one of the richest men weve got !
they are getting married , i hear , quite soon ?
for goodness sake , tuppence .
but murder by someone from outside .
but i tell you that girl needs help .
and which was the one that camethat had the appearance of comingfrom me ?
now is a wonderful moment .
that finishes with the vicarage .
but there she is , and i carry up four trays a day .
aristides in the centre of the picture , everything made sensehard , practical , everyday sense .
jefferson , for instance ?
how long did you plan to stay there ?
i imagine that most young men of spirit would feel like that .
she herself would have been horrified at the thought of such a thing .
thomas beresford , and last , but not least , as guest of honour , miss jane finn .
well , he said , with a chuckle , heres your hidden treasure , all right .
then , as she sat down opposite him , she said , after a momentary hesitation : i dare say youre right , m .
and if you defy them , well , what happens ?
was it deacon ?
no , it was not destroyed !
but there is another .
but this one hereand this one again he pointed .
please send a cheque , postal or money order (not currency) worth the purchase , price plus _num_ p per book for postage (maximum postage required is _num_ .
how was it that , knowing women as he does , he did not foresee that madame would have kept that letter ?
on their heads be it if you have anything of which to complain !
arrangements ?
kenneth marshall said with a sigh : dont you realize that i said id seen you in the mirror in order to back up your story .
she asked coldly .
sandra had asked with quiet polite concern : have you got a headache tonight ?
i had a ripping bathe there and i lunched off a tinned tongue and two tomatoes , and i came back in the afternoon full of confidence and enthusiasm to get on with my sketch .
ten the parlourmaid we found mrs .
one of us has got to go to bradley and fix it up .
let us proceed .
there was some sort of mystery about her , and that , of course , heightened her attraction for two boys home from the wilds .
now hold the mirror steady .
i said it to you once before , do you remember ?
ii it was late evening a week later when the summons came .
he took a revolver with him .
mrs bantry nodded .
you may say it is all the same in the end , but it is not the same .
in your profession such sympathies and tendencies are naturally regarded with suspicion .
that was a summons for victoria .
poirot , than i do , said mrs .
we couldnt get in .
nobody i know .
and soi wont have any jewels .
nurse hopkins sighed and helped herself to buttered teacake .
its a real thing that really happened .
telegrams ?
a torn shapeless bit of black material lay in a heap near the outside door .
i was fully convinced that he did not believe a word she was saying , but having heard her story he could do no more until he had confirmed or disproved it .
i think it was at that moment that i first believed dr .
all the same , im not too easy in my mind about him .
ordained deacon and received a title to the parish of hoxton , _num_ .
would you mind , i said , if i went back outside ?
i have got a cousin who is nursing , i remarked .
there is the strychnine sold across the counter at styles st .
some people made the mistake of underrating him .
' ' oo s .
what do i know about business ?
dont you remember ?
and youre quite sure about that , mrs .
it was still respectful but not quite so respectful .
maude demanded in her deep voice : what do you mean , rosamund ?
he was married to both of them , said miss marple .
nothe other side .
oh isis , do not let yahmose also diesave him from the vengeful hatred of nofret .
get me an apple , ingrid , said geraldine .
im all right , roly , clarissa interjected , faintly .
poirot betook himself to _num_ gloucester terrace .
one cant blame any one else for the things one decides to do with ones eyes open .
nephew lives in canada .
ruth said to poirot : this singular consternation , m .
dont be sillyi wonder if the others have found out anything ?
i have left you in my will _num_ .
its particularly noticeable in a case of this kind .
it was a loud uncontrolled laugh .
no one could see you dance and forget .
perhaps she goes on her knees and flings her arms around his neck .
my friends , i have reviewed the facts in my mind , and have also gone over to myself the evidence of the passengerswith this result .
did the man join the train at paris , and did she conceal him in the adjoining compartment ?
or at any rate , when she was seeming to be slightly flustered .
time , thought bobby suddenly , was a very frightening thing .
got into the papers and i think it was a wife of hisi mean of the above-suspicion naval officer .
its very cold .
how do you mean , makes everything wrong ?
lane stretched up , but he could not quite reach to the back of the shelf .
she looked away ; her head dropped down .
he can administer the estate for harryand none better .
inglethorp herself !
and dont give yourself airs .
succeeding the delirium there came a state of lethargy .
we studied it in silence .
his pyjama jacket , stained with rusty patches , had been unbuttoned and thrown back .
so that what we said could be overheard ?
better see who the fellow is , he said .
then how do you explain this ?
the chief constable went on : if by any chance theres a dope gang mixed up in this , it opens up several possibilities .
would you be surprised to learn that this particular case was sold by messrs woolworth only a few weeks ago and that , moreover , it is of a pattern and colour that has only been manufactured for the last three months ?
they say that happened the year after the old mill burned down or that happened after the lightning struck the big oak and killed farmer james or that was the year we had the polio epidemic .
and once she told her damning story of his having asked her to meet him at the creek , where would tim kendal be ?
jim fanthorp said : but this is all pure conjecture .
she stuck to her point .
a stately butler opened the door and stood aside to let them enter .
the curious things that have happened in your life .
astwell was a locquacious lady .
i didnt feel i could ever trust anyone again .
all the same i shouldnt have said roger was the type .
you see whom its addressed to ?
the curious thing is that most people never notice it .
pilar said with a space between each word : severalthousandsofpounds ?
the more secret laboratories have been tunnelled right into the rock .
i shouldnt say so , said sarah .
one of these days ill ask you out to lunch and give you the doings from the beginning .
the bells seemed to own large portions of queensland , and if we had had time aileen said she would have taken me to see the northern out-station , which was much wilder and more primitive .
lady julia asked abruptly : what is being done ?
almost the richest man in america .
i feel i ought to do something about itbut i confess id like to keep sheila grant out of the limelight if i could .
they were addressed , but not stamped .
the police dont , said the young man .
oh , no , sir .
pelican point , wasnt it ?
then he grasped the poker firmly and rose to his feet .
it widens the possibilities , said miss marple .
he practises as a solicitoran ordinary genuine business with perfectly genuine clients .
let us pass on to the handkerchief .
anyway , quite literally , you cant .
in any case what do you lose ?
absurd to say i cannot do a thing which i have just done !
reiter was a stout , fair young man with glasses .
she looked at me coldly .
hercule poirot said mildly : i am not a fool and i do not think so .
there was a moment of horrible embarrassment .
for who knows at what moment i may be taken from you ?
or some tea if it is easier .
and jim , what was his last name ?
but possibly an accident , dont you think ?
he looked at it with a good deal of interest .
hes been more human , more alive .
tuppence breathed a sigh of relief at the knowledge that all was in order for the arrival of her family .
it wanted some five minutes to eleven when tuppence reached the block of buildings in which the offices of the esthonia glassware co .
there was the early morning tea , of course , but bernsdorff had intimated that the taste would be noticeable in tea .
she had divorced him a year or two after the marriage .
the difficulty would be in keeping anybody alive , even ourselves .
did she always do that ?
but i often come to this place .
my valet , georges , an admirable man with whom i sometimes permitted myself to discuss a point , has no imagination whatever .
he knew who she was though hed never spoken to her .
i suppose i shall have to tell you , i said slowly .
eyes blueor greyor perhaps brown .
if von deinim was sent as an agent to england , special care would be taken that his record should be consistent with his own account of himself .
that would belet me seethe twenty-fifth , would it not ?
they manage not to take a full overdose .
he began to like books and the past and things that were well divorced from everyday life .
whos using it , what for and why .
everything you wanteverything youve ever hoped for , and you go and bleat out no like an idiotic little sheep .
refusing him the publicity hes hankering after .
just attend to your appearance before i bring him in .
he said : theres dirt and dirt , my boy .
he seems to have had at no time any gift for asserting himself or for impressing his personality on other people .
nothing can happen .
they walked together up the path again past the battery garden .
to rush off in a car , to silence rudely those people who were anxious to tell him things , to cut short conversations on the plea of urgent necessity .
it wont take long .
i dont remember if that was at carolines suggestion or not .
the pilot looked puzzled .
lets preserve the niceties of speech .
yes , i expect so .
i beg your pardon , my dear ?
erskine broke in , saying in her deep authoritative voice , and you are really looking for a house in this part of the world ?
tomorrow would be soon enough .
hamilton had been kindness itself to heronly hugobut she wouldnt think of hugo !
and the terms of this will ?
farther down the road , however , mr .
she did in the old woman too , by the way .
soon his teachers became interested , encouraged him .
he treated his nephew , the captain marsh i have mentioned to you , in the most shameful wayliterally turned him out of the house and discontinued his allowance .
that covers nearly all , does it not ?
there are different kinds of civilization said bob vaguely .
im sure she was .
yes , a nasty job .
his fathers second wife was a fluffy little thing , years younger than he was .
it mightnt have , because i hadnt time to be clever or think of making an alibi .
big family it was .
all deadall deadrobert , soniadarling , darling daisy .
when jennifer gardner returned , she had taken off her hat .
are you still acting , mrs .
blore , or of mr .
finally i decided to run down in the car and see her , and ask her what had put the idea into her head .
even apart from her illness , she had been very unhappy about a sister who had recently died .
you have good histrionic powers .
as you say , its a common enough name , but theres the christian name as well .
reilly had said his partner had had no joy of living .
hes got a damned offensive manner , said clarke .
' ' oh , yes , he was quite helpless without his spectacles .
but she wouldnt be a real invalid .
faintlylike that , and the voice answered , the avenger .
i always thought a millennium was in the futurethe time when everything comes right .
through the frosted glass of the upper half of the door he saw a silhouettea big man in a slouch hat .
and once i realized it i had my first vague glimmering of the truth .
i see , said sir rowland , moving back to the body on the floor and leaning over it .
you have been in hell .
her account tallied in every respect with those he had already heard .
his quick ear had caught a faint rustle outside on the landing .
from the scullery we passed into the kitchen where we established ourselves comfortably in two chairs with the door into the hall ajar .
i told henry so .
wait a minute and ill get it for you .
well , said tommy , i suppose they were bound to tumble to it some time or other , sir .
anyway , we dont want isaac about .
she was wearing a big blanket coat .
im hungry .
captain trevelyan was constantly urged to treat the house as though we hadnt rented it .
that is inexcusablefor you had a second chance again just now when he said , youre apt to be done down if you speak nothing but good american .
i think i may say , he murmured , that your confidence will not be misplaced .
he lived there too , with his wife emily .
lady horbury .
would you kindly explain what you are talking about ?
she handed me a third letter .
its possible , though , persisted the other .
he escorted her to the head of the alleyway and yelled in his usual violent fashion .
it is proved , explained poirot .
the question rose to her lips so naturally that she was almost unaware of asking it .
tim turned round in his chair .
i do hope , she said , that gerda is lying down .
this was mr .
roddy said rather stiffly : it seemed the natural thing to do at the time .
she said : its no good that young woman shirking her responsibilities .
and i suppose youre going on dithering about with it all the evening .
they look after a little girl for someone .
what we had to do was really quite simple .
frankly , he said , i never believed it .
or by a slight stretch of fancy , unknown !
i never remember a waters living here or having heard of one .
not a quick man , the esteemed wilmott , but sure .
her visit was a lucky coincidence , since it distracted your mind from the real object of my questions .
she said shed give me a ring .
the voice said cautiously : i dont know whether he is here .
she grew delicately pink .
clement , i believe the time will come when well be horrified to think of the long centuries in which weve punished people for diseasewhich they cant help , poor devils .
but he knew very little about mr .
he spoke in a high clipped voicea little red , foxy man with a short moustache and slightly shifty eyes .
oh , not the hatredif true .
now , you are laughing at me , my dears , said miss marple placidly .
wouldnt that be rather too obvious ?
like in a magazine seriala synopsis .
thats exactly what you were doing .
there was a hoarse murmur .
its no good beating about the bush .
the church was unusually full .
people like talking about the past , said mrs .
did e now ?
then there was blakes elder brother .
colonel carbury turned away his head and coughed .
rupert carrington is cleared .
harry rose too and went after him , laughing .
i seem to remember hearing something about a mary jordan , i think it was .
she might conceivably have let him alone once she was sure of him .
yes , but capable of any number of harmless interpretations .
keep after it .
i am alive .
then starkwedder remarked , well , i suppose id better go and see whether theyve managed to get my car out of the ditch yet .
i wonder where she can be ?
where have you been vegetating ?
he said it was a bore , but hed have to go .
timothy because he had hated and resented his brother and had craved the power his brothers money would give .
she was working in the garden , and called out to us as we climbed over the stile .
she went a little way away from them and sat down in a chair by the window .
my cabin is intended (a) for me to sleep in , and (b) to attempt to dress in .
you more or less said good-bye to us all in the library .
n-not at all he cut her short .
im just full of natural admiration .
said chief-inspector davy , cheerfully .
she , too , wanted to own crale body and soul .
henrietta made a faint sound .
theres some kind of educational racketor you exchange with a swiss childthere are all sorts of ways .
it will beone day .
ii tommy was establishing the happiest of relationships with major bletchley .
i really think floribundas are such a great answer to difficulties .
you called it the tuesday night club .
this must be his cousin .
what do you mean what about him ?
yes , i believe shes coming too .
rhodes broke in .
what is your own opinion of mr .
awfully little , that is .
not unless you do .
rather a difficult position sometimes ?
yes , theres one .
he has a record .
though they have their uses too .
always hopes that some day shell marry him .
miss emily brewster , southgates , sunbury-on-thames .
a coarse , singularly ugly manbut what does she look like ?
it returned no answer to questions .
i am careful and conscientious over them , but no one is better aware than myself of their deficiencies .
im not much of a one for art .
and they are represented loosely in the public mind as russia and the communists and america .
its worthwhile finding out if she went to bed with a headache for instance last night .
they often hid things in cisterns .
anthony was frowning .
ali yusuf drove out to see the new road construction , stopped his car at the airstrip , joined rawlinson and expressed a desire to take a short flight and see the dam and the new highway construction from the air .
so we are not to see no _num_ tonight ?
were you all happy together ?
anyway , her two children had died .
you are known to be working with me .
i shall know more about it tomorrow .
i knew something else .
its no use looking at edward , said lady angkatell .
poirot looked round him .
to have had these creative ideas and to have been frustrated by lack of meansthat would have been unbearable .
he stooped , and with a flourish produced an immense specimen of the tribe , which i duly accepted in the spirit in which it was offered .
his own wants are very simple .
a voice spoke behind him .
sometimes she wondered why this was , since they were not fugitives .
but there was a new note in her voicea note suddenly alert and watchful .
what did you mean , mums , when you saidthat first morning i was homeif he is her brother ?
he turned then and went back across the lawn towards the tea table and the harlequin tea set , and beyond that , to his old friend tom addison .
the commander won the hole .
ill come with you , if you dont mind , clarissa offered , in case my little stepdaughter should wake up and be frightened .
her laugh floated down to him , clear and happy .
' ' i will come immediately .
evelyn nodded .
it was , i think , another twenty-four hours before he told me , straight out .
the south african war , thats it .
with mr .
nothing wrong with them , highly respectable , well known in hampshire where they come from .
farr is the son of my fathers onetime partner in south africa .
arrived at our lodgings , he restrained me at the door of the sitting room .
very regular in his habits was the capting .
and weve got these two new productions were working on i didnt say we .
welli suppose so .
right up to our wedding day i waited for another threatening letter .
i am most grateful for what you have been able to tell me .
good-bye , m .
perhaps shes still down with her people in the country .
but of course i know it !
the man in front of her turned abruptly , and she stepped into his place .
argyle were difficult for her to understand .
i dont see that we can make a case against him .
whats the proper manner ?
a pipe for me .
well , that was very nice of you , dear .
i was at new college with a jack watts .
this attitude , lucy noted , was most unpalatable to his brother harold .
' she was , he perceived , an enthusiastic bather .
that , i remarked , is what people have always said about any discovery that doesnt accord with recognised ideas .
good morning , said tommy amiably .
and between that time and when you met us , nobody came out of the gate ?
i didnt shoot him .
that was the reason of his aching head .
but there wouldnt be any reason for her murdering letty blacklock .
i thank you , said poirot , sinking down into a basket chair .
her exquisite clothes set off the swaying grace of her figure .
patrick redfern stared angrily after him .
but do you not see thisand thisand this he illustrated each this with a jab at the unoffending joint , dislodging small icicles as he did so .
there were three of them .
since this morning .
a vague memory stirred in the inspectors mind .
never have i seen a young gentleman look more like a sheep than he did this morningand thats a sure sign .
and anyway theres absolutely no doubt about the cause of death .
he would too .
bridget opened round eyes .
' ' and then , you see , the crime would simply have taken place somewhere else .
jesmond and the ease with which he had made use of lady morecombe to further his own purposes .
its a disgraceful thing to do , and remember this , listeners hear no good of themselves .
do you think nigel would do a thing like that ?
biggs , do you think mrs .
dont take it to heart , lad , he said kindly .
of course not , she said indignantly .
david , he was devoted to her .
the petrol feed seemed choked .
now the story told by madame beroldy in court as to the russians was admittedly a fabrication .
corrigan and he told me about the list of names .
i didnt kill the fellow .
it was double pneumonia .
his hands rested on the arms , his eyes looked at the chimneypiece in front of him without seeing it .
a lot of those teddy-looking boys carry knives .
i got the letter about it last night .
no , it seems all quite clear and above board .
theres the big house , sittaford house , which captain trevelyan built , and thats let now to a south african lady .
now weve got to hear what reilly has to say .
templeton .
so why did she go and leave him ?
shes a fine girl .
riddell inspector glen was looking rather gloomy .
said lewis bitterly .
not to speak to , sir .
then why has she been left out ?
simon is my world .
on the wall over my bed there was a great big eye in a gilt frame .
harold waring drew a deep breath .
victoria wrenched her thoughts away from these interesting speculations and returned to hard facts .
but their first assignment , for the sinister mr whittington , draws them into a sinister , political conspiracy .
there was one at gossington hall .
there are things you could throw in my teeth , too .
what put it into your head ?
and at lastthe day !
the fact that she herself was murdered the day afterwards may be the purest coincidence .
the walls were a shade just off-whitethe thick pile carpet was so neutral as to be almost colourlessso was the upholstery .
the only royal prince he had seen so far was working a lift in one of the less well-known hotels .
with an oath rayburn sprang after him .
youre not really mental , are you ?
suddenly a faint trace of animation came into marys manner .
she was just coming out of her bedroom when i came in from my walkthat was about a quarter-past twelve .
well , yes , in a way , he told her .
but yes , but yes , i comprehend perfectly .
miss chadwick repeated the message .
no , said ann with emphasis , no indeed .
you notice the absence of windows , and the thickness of the close-fitting door .
she was , luke thought , completely the country spinster .
she thought regretfully of her friends in englandsir henry clitheringalways willing to listen indulgentlyhis godson dermot , who in spite of his increased status at scotland yard was still ready to believe that when miss marple voiced an opinion there was usually something behind it .
what do you mean , found her out ?
im not fit to shake hands , she said .
its not the memoirs ?
takes two strong men and a stick to get me on my feet .
henry mitchell said soberly : its a nasty thing to happen , sir .
poirot , tohe consulted the passport he still held in his handto madameermademoiselle grey .
thats what i said , and its true , too .
she took her hand from where she had laid it over the mouthpiece .
dermots heart contracted .
pilar said disapprovingly : but surelyyou know .
charles had a feeling that the tables were turned .
i may say we have already briefed sir edwin bulmer , k .
but surelysurely , it had to do with this girl .
rosalind , i said , would you mind if i married again ?
giles said sharply , safety ?
well just catch the _num_ : _num_ .
we laugh about it sometimes .
im sure i dont want to get killed .
they are deep , each cut must have severed blood vesselsand yetthe edges do not gape .
but tell me , monsieur , who , should you say , had a chance of robbing this poor gentleman ?
sobek like a pricked bladderipy made to look a childyahmose shamed as a bullied husband .
no other fellows going to get her except over my dead body .
_num_ madame giselle no .
miss marple said quickly , please forgive me .
now we come to a very grave point .
a shadow crossed moiras face .
something stirred .
you know , tommy , butchers , for instance , know something about meat , dont they ?
rymer rose from her bed .
i hadnt begun to suspect then .
is this an exercise in suppositions , monsieur poirot , or are there any facts behind it ?
clemency leonides said with a very faint smile : really , you know , he wouldnt hurt a fly .
the prospect fascinated her .
haworth , i mean .
it seems indicated .
they showed it to you and asked you if it was yours ?
but that , to partridges regret , she had not succeeded in learning .
alfred looked twice round the cornice as though seeking for inspiration , swallowed three or four times , and then took the inevitable course of a weak will opposed to a strong one .
his porter , staggering slightly under the weight of the solid leather suitcase , indicated vera and lombard .
a small cold wind sprang up suddenly , chilled their necks and passed .
it also seemed to show that he had come to the place by train and was intending to leave for london .
i am not usually credited with having much imagination , said lord alloway with a slight smile .
yesyes , i suppose it is .
miss de haviland was in the garden alone .
mcgintys murder .
they were flying over the sea , but clouds soon blocked out the blue water below them and victoria settled back in her seat with a yawn .
it may , you understand , have been a relative of mine , poirot explained .
of course notof course not .
the interestthe drama .
one for evening and one for travelling and onevery strange , you know .
wed like to know that very much , mrs .
not for the record .
sorry , superintendent .
christine looked round helplessly .
had a complete breakdown , i shouldnt wonder .
folliat looked rather astonished .
i hope youll find everything quite comfortable .
here there was a cheap smartness that told its own tale .
i go to paris on monday .
she flushed , as he looked at her quizzically .
unfortunately for him he was one of those men who have cat allergy .
the comparative obscurity of his position might in reality be useful to him , since he would be anxious to be well out of the limelight .
miss pebmarsh had asked for you specially .
not only a brilliant scientist ; he was a man of the utmost uprightness and probity .
your grandmother told me how delicate you are !
shocked , yes .
jasper prince , deeply regretted .
its something of a story , i said evasively .
people have been known to break and throw away all their clulas in a mood of intense exasperation over the game !
i suggest we verify that .
parker pyne stepped gingerly out in the mud .
again she stole a quick glance at him .
she produced from her handbag a small mirror , a powder-puff and lipstick .
did he feel the need of reinforcement ?
i was right , said raymond excitedly .
there was a little pause inside before molly spoke .
makes them feel one of the family and gives them jobs to do and all that to encourage their sense of responsibility .
and i thought as i was up , i might as well go and see that man in harley street about my arthritis .
and the house and everything .
then i took the mail train north .
monsieur kramenin ?
i asked her if she remembered my friend ginger .
she looked across at giles , sitting opposite her .
an infernal machine of some kind ?
bishop accepted the chairs with becoming thanks .
poirot ordered a whisky for the colonel and a double orangeade full of sugar for himself .
have i not performed the twelfth labor of hercules and brought cerberus up from hell to prove my case ?
all i mean is , that hes someone who knows rutherford hall very well .
philip blake said : we all know what happened .
hes all right .
a bold finesse for game and rubber .
we passed through it into a rather surprisingly spacious hall .
it was bitter to van aldin that a daughter of his should be gulled by such a man , yet he was forced to admit that she was in good companythat other well-bred and intelligent women had succumbed just as easily to the counts fascination .
pleurisy , said mrs .
their relations dont like them and push them out there for that reason .
and rosemary had enjoyed it too .
perhaps , perhaps , murmured my friend .
how did the radfordshire council meeting go ?
we agreed to take two enormous tins of it .
id have felt inclined to snap at him a bit myself .
the young man was slightly alarmed .
the lawyer stirred .
but what i always say is , somebody must keep their head .
she went out on an assignment earlier this afternoon , she explained .
?
the truth , i have always thought , is curious and beautiful .
i told you i didnt believe you were the murderer .
i thought it better toerembroider .
prominent local resident murdered by mysterious assailant , the headline announced .
george had the true-born britons prejudice against foreignersand an especial distaste for german-looking foreigners .
theres no one else .
poirot said : so you feel like that about her ?
poirot extracted various details as to ted bigland .
no , if theres no principle involved , id say let it alone .
then he left her .
it doesnt read like ascher , he said at last .
he looked at it closely .
nineteen very glad to have met you , said lawrence .
his eyes , those deep blue steady eyes , looked across at poirot .
i expect the girls ask for it .
i shant talk , said miss marple .
crump , then , when my backs turned out she sneaks .
i depart .
its like this , sir .
out of the tail of my eye i saw mrs .
that is mainly because skin afflictions are enigmas to the medical profession and to everyone else .
gwenda stirred .
repairs too , said miss marple , come very heavy nowadays .
it must have been hell for him .
she turned towards the sofa .
after the andover crime , what did we know about the murderer ?
immediately betterton dropped on his knees by hilary and buried his face on her shoulder .
will you be so kind as to leave me now my cabin ?
perhapsyes .
but life , major riddle , is often amazingly like the pictures .
first we had mrs .
race said : it certainly shows that she had a motive for taking her own life .
i wonder you wonder what ?
i compile a list of questions concerning each person .
after that everything was plain sailing .
that means it must be one of those three men .
she investigated on her own behalf , found that she was correct in her surmise , and brought the contents of the racquet to me .
that studied coldness and reserve of his might conceal a good deal of passionate feeling .
the only time ellie had seen her before was when she told our fortunes .
on one such occasion she looked into a courtyard with a fountain playing and cushioned seats and deck chairs round it , with tall palms growing up and a garden beyond , that looked like the backcloth of a stage set .
i reached the spot and knelt down .
pursued sir george .
he didnt exactly speculate with the money , but he invested in the wrong things at the wrong time .
poirot frowned at both of us .
well , no , not exactly not at the time .
at that moment she could have murdered vivien lee .
for the first minute or two the young man thought he must be dreaming .
he appeared to me perfectly capable of managing his own affairs .
if i dont shoot her now ill wait and get her in some other way .
the other woman raised wondering , clear blue eyes .
original woman , i said .
she glanced down at her thin , black-clad arms ending in those claw-like yellow hands with the rings on the fingers .
ii dont know your name ?
well , im really going now .
one would like to know why .
its curious , certainly , said virginia thoughtfully .
you had with you a bottle of some freshly killed animals blood to which you had added a quantity of sodium citrate .
after him came james ryder , somewhat on edge and brusque in manner .
lucilla drake had been hector marles half-sister , the child of an earlier marriage .
but later something happened to convince him , and then he got the wind up in earnest .
isis itdo you know anything about it ?
but chuck goes the weasel sounds much the same .
i have got an old recipe of my grandmothers for tansy tea that is worth any amount of your drugs .
i should appreciate it , said mrs .
however , we will not go into that now .
in your manuscript you have drawn a neat little plan of the study .
id no idea it was such a slow process .
or it could be that mrs .
this about a book that obstinately refused to come out the way you wished , whose characters are sticky , the plot needlessly involved , and the dialogue stiltedor so you think yourself .
it was all so simple .
he asked , quietly .
came back not ten minutes ago , said mrs .
i saw you from my window walking down the drive with simon doyle this morning .
but i used to do watercolours myself as a girl and i heard a lot of talk about painting and that made it nice for mrs .
the gates of hell are open to all ?
clever girl that .
you see , she explained , following directness with tact , dr .
those old georges didnt know much .
if you never face despair , you will never have faced , or become , a christian , or known a christian life .
haydockhaydock .
my muscles are pretty toughshes a skinny frail old pussy .
the chief constable cleared his throat and took up the questioning .
the largest house in the neighbourhood , gossington hall , was recently sold as a residence for marina gregg , the film star , and her husband .
the mystery of the bathroom will be investigated tomorrow morning .
after all , there are heaps of other places where he can be treated .
from the lab .
i am a consultant , said hercule poirot loftily .
' lord mayfield stared at him .
have you shown nurse all the beauties of the town ?
very sorry to bother you , miss marple , said the colonel , when i had introduced him , putting on his bluff military manner which he had an idea was attractive to elderly ladies .
and her dominance has been mental .
but all sorts of other stories go flying about .
her husband deliberately flouted her and introduced his mistress into her home .
she had skill and nerve and was a good driver ; had it been otherwise her reckless pace would have ended in disaster more than once .
parker pyne surprised him still further .
and ive decided to leave the stage and just be a mother .
k for us every day .
i took an early opportunity of verifying my conjectures .
you wanted it to be true ?
you have nerve , said the other , after a minutes pause .
then , accusingly : youll be mrs .
she had been dead at least two hours , otherwise , in that hot sun , her face could never have felt cold to your touch .
the end is nearly always sudden .
hubbardand struck !
he wanted to leave his wife and children , he wanted me to get a divorce from my husband and marry him .
he said there were probably far more women poisoners going about the world than anyone knew .
the start of the whole thing must be john savages death and will .
they may be spying on me now .
you did not acquaint me with that fact this morning , madame la comtesse .
well , what id call an odd-looking kind of woman .
you are interested in criminology ?
but i said nothing .
anyway , as entwhistle knew , within the last six months richard abernethie had invited to stay with him , in succession , his nephew george , his niece susan and her husband , his niece rosamund and her husband , and his sister-in-law , mrs .
persecution mania .
louis , had become acquainted .
i always consider you a lucky man , monsieur van aldin ; you are not like our popular idea of american millionaires , martyrs to dyspepsia .
he scowled more than ever .
a perfect bedroom decorated throughout in the modern style .
but they are marvellous , all the same .
whatever your name is , im glad youve had the sense to come to the right conclusion , though if you ask me , i call it damned cheek of entwhistle to go commissioning you to come prying and poking about .
but i love the italians , continued mrs .
christopher moved nearer to her , lowering his voice .
we dont like welshers .
as far as i can remember , i didnt meet anybody .
alecs just as moody andoh , i dont knowwrapped up in himself .
amy had been out of sortsa nasty cough and one thing and another (those silly cheap silk stockings they will wear and shoes with paper soles practicallyof course they catch chills) and shed been to the doctor that afternoon .
she drew herself up .
well , thats one thing .
the inquest is fixed for tomorrow after the postmortem .
oh , dear vicar , you are so unworldly !
' ' no , ' i confessed .
we found one address and wrote there , but it proved to be simply a room she had taken in which to keep her things .
so this mrs .
dyson is ?
and , anyway , there is nothing i can do .
it was a meaningless gesture , yet it seemed fraught with significance .
sometimes i think its a pity we give them to them .
he continued dreamily : it was a curious affair that , altogether .
miss oscar is dealing with most of them .
but it was your wife who was to be ill and die , wasnt it ?
jacqueline looked at the sternness of his face .
at dinner yesterday evening .
as they lowered him carefully into a big leather armchair and his face came into view , i uttered a cry .
but it wasnt too devastating .
she said she had something to do there .
she had continued to prosper .
all right , _num_ oclock do you ?
i dont know where shes been .
ive never actually met him until this trip .
and take st .
but anne meredith is different .
upwards house .
now as to wine a technical conversation ensued , jules , the matre dhotel , assisting .
the ancient egyptians , i believe , had certain ideas .
these things dont happen .
i suppose they could put her off , but why should they put her off ?
now that very self-same day gladys sanders had said to me that shed got a wonderful digestion and was thankful for it .
she looked up and jumped .
not very long .
and i hadnt got ambition , or i didnt think i had ambition .
i mean was he a man whocared very much for his friends ?
poirot clasped that portion of his anatomy before continuing .
prepare yourself for a shock .
theres the problem of the parkinsons and the problem of mary jordan and there must be a lot of other problems too .
taking a small piece of green chiffon from his pocket , he dabbed his finger with it gingerly .
gladys sighed ecstatically .
oh , dear , she said , isnt it dreadful ?
a cup of hot tea never did anyone any harm , enunciated mrs .
he said : i begin to understand miss claythorne ?
those autographs .
i wondered if amyas would say anything to me , but he didnt say much .
slowly , with an almost ritual air , she raised her hands , took off the hat and laid it down on the windowsill .
where does it come from ?
but out she goes .
well , she accepted a lift from someonea stranger .
i feel terribly underdone !
van rooy sang wotan .
i am certain she takes cocaine .
michael was aghast .
youre quite right .
i dont know why i came to you , he repeated .
it was very brief , no mention was made of the a b c letter , and a verdict was returned of murder by some person or persons unknown .
but i was told she was out doing work for a client somewhere and i didnt want to interrupt anything of that kind so i thought it would be better if i came round here and talked to her in her own home .
you seem to have invented a romantic fairy story of your own , i said .
thoroughly nice chap .
there was also one other psychological point of interestthe curious state of tension described as existing amongst the members of the expedition .
princess shaista , first cousin and only near relative of the late prince ali yusuf of ramat , goes there this next term .
eh bien , greed will hang him all right unless i am very much mistaken .
we must get in touch with mr adams at once .
and my mother and fatheri dont worry about them anymore .
what the other people who were there at the time were like .
in the character of the dead man .
but his heart must have been weak .
they cannot be to you just pretty coloured playthingsmore is the pity .
i came over on the lusitania to take up a post in paris .
miss marple turned over on her pillowprogramme for tomorrowor rather for todayfurther investigation of the hillingdons , the dysons and arthur jackson , valet-attendant .
poirot raised his eyebrows , but did not reply .
appendicitisthats what the doctor said and probably not appendicitis at all , interrupted mrs .
good man to work with .
i knew , i think , that i was being foolish and giving way to exaggerated feelings , but there it was .
she cursed and raved impotently , but at last she gave in .
i had to kill him !
there was , he knew , one place where one could scramble down fairly easily .
rich ruby port-type wine .
he couldnt get the hang of these people .
and today when they came home and i found that there was only his fathers word for it that ronald had been stung , i remembered the other death from a wasp sting and i knew !
he had no intimate friends or relations in this country and his disappearance was unlikely to be noticed for some time .
boris got up and began striding up and down .
she leaned suddenly towards him .
hullo , simon !
a woman who doesnt lie is a woman without imagination and without sympathy .
she gave a sigh of relief .
weve never met , have we ?
the police found her all right .
no clue , no hint , of what kind of a man he was .
very dressy .
not quite to mepartly , i think , to himself .
lady alexandra ?
that note being destroyed so carefully can only mean one thing .
the shop of m .
said something to a nice fat woman whod got a small child she was trying to amuse .
wrong girl !
lance grinned .
this was cold comfort .
couragecourage there was a fresh hush .
no cloak and dagger .
she thought : hes been kind to menobody knows how kind .
im a very busy man , mr .
i want to find out the truth .
by the way , i havent asked you what your interest is in the case .
either of them , poirot thought , could be relied upon for judgement and good sense .
anne sank down with a sigh .
i said it was very good .
i didnt want to be distracted .
she said : youve known .
poirot got up and went across to the library .
did it strike youreflect before you answerdid it strike you that there was something wrong with that statement of miss lawsons ?
and theres one other significant fact .
the train had stopped .
glad you got the names for me , mr .
and it cannot be so easy these days to have christmas festivities .
and now i know .
rudi talked big and all thatbut i always took it with a grain of salt .
and so it was that i started on my long career ; not that i suspected at the time that it was going to be a long career .
they were in your pocket , my lord .
well , you know you did , in a way .
you know , poirot , it ' s a pity the boot wasn ' t on the other leg .
they were shepherded into the library for that purpose , where detective sergeant jones was waiting for them with his little roller .
all too long .
his overcoat was lying over a chair and he put it on .
theres one thing you havent explained .
as it happened , he had never made her acquaintance .
but he judged he could make no further progress at present .
ah , well , i cant complain .
well , she hadnt wished to get mixed up in any murders , but it just happened .
my brother lawrence is convinced that we are making a fuss over nothing .
some write right-handed , but play golf left-handed .
she wondered why she should feel so nervous doing so .
and there was someone in the room she had heard somethingsurely she had heard something .
greenway was untouched .
the bullet was the only contretemps , and even that , as he thought , passed off well .
so i neednt worry you with many questions .
broadribb wondered what her first words would be .
ingless long and distinguished service in china .
then he looked from dr .
oh , worried about your wife ?
i think the girl gladys had seen someone performing some action that seemed to her needed explanation .
i handled it with a comfortable feeling .
almost automatically mrs .
he was quite oblivious , she thought , of everything .
no money as far as i know .
it was charles chandler who was driven to cut the throats of sheep in lonely fields .
inquired cowan hopefully .
legge came up here to meet .
with calling oneself a kleptomaniac when one is really a thief , do you mean ?
he was waiting for us .
you cannot be sure , said hercule poirot .
was it something that ruth also had seen or heard but which she had failed to appreciate at its rightful significance ?
starting from the point : if i wanted to hide something , where would i choose to put it , and where would it be likely to remain undiscovered ?
only the stones .
because you could not get a reply to your knocks ?
ive got very sharp ears .
perhaps you would like to come with me ?
yes , said the doctor thoughtfully .
banbury , i may say , was about twenty-five miles from where they lived , but it was treated as though it was lands end .
well , youll keep this confidential , i know you can hold your tongue in these things , but the local police have always had the idea that the husband , amos perry , might just possibly have been the man who was responsible for a wave of child murders a good many years ago .
what did pippa say ?
quite satisfactory .
i never felt slow or stupid , or at a loss for things to say , when i was with reggie .
the sounds gradually died down , the lights disappeared .
are we getting on ?
all these happenings have been upsettingbut i have been thinking lately that very likely they are all for the best .
i want to get the hang of things .
weve disposed of one .
we still live on the island .
he was an attractive-looking boy , with a nice way of talking and passing the time of day .
emma doesnt knownobody knows .
bobby followed the other two out to the bentley .
besides sittaford house , captain trevelyan owns some property in the neighbourhood of plymouth , and various investments he made from time to time have fluctuated in value .
the old man who had been cutting peat was the first of them .
sanity is the one unbelievable bore .
unpleasant looking , the whole thing .
she looked at him curiously , but nodded assent .
i dont want him suffering , imprisoned , cut off from his life because of a perfectly natural and unfortunate mistake .
let us forget the occasion on which we first met .
hed deal with mrs .
satipy put a slightly shaking hand on renisenbs arm , urging her back the way she had come and at the touch renisenb felt a sudden revolt .
there a motor was waiting , and soon i was rapidly whirling across the flat flemish plains .
there was a cracking of wooda crash , and the door burst from its hinges .
it has to be low or highbut when its running out it sweeps you right down to the mouth of the river .
bland must be a nice worthy man , said colin , with a shudder .
luke said : i really think it will be the best thing , since you are so kind , miss waynflete .
cest magnifique !
do you think she really went there ?
she was monumental , you know , must have weighed seventeen stone , and all the five daughters revolved round her .
van aldin looked at her in astonishment .
but were getting somewhere at last .
he added ruefully : shes rather a formidable old lady , mr .
no , no , i suggest you tell me the truth .
i dont wonder , he said , that richard was disappointed in you .
the two men went out together and blunt talked eagerly of his hobby .
she has been seen coming out of agrasatos native curio shop .
one of them died .
i told her id throw her down on to the stones below .
perrot .
where can i go ?
ah , hitchhiking , he said .
automatically , superintendent battle moved a step nearer the door , as if to cut off a retreat that way , but anthony showed no signs of doing anything dramatic .
but it isnt necessary , surely ?
always one tried to shield him from punishment .
how do you account for this ?
just like a lawyer .
yes , that sounds very queer now i think back to it .
they belong to a slave race .
now really , thats very interesting .
it is because though she may be unwomanly and undignified in what she is doing , you have the inner conviction that she has right on her side .
got any feelings for him ?
thanks , pal , he said , and shifting the pack he carried he strode on towards warmsley vale .
thirdly , there was the wood .
that would still fit the facts as we know them .
hed only got to pop out of his photographic place , cross the courtyard to do his dirty work and hare back again while the coast was clear .
she appeared quite bewildered .
its the pitching i cant standnever really happy at seaand left all alone here hour after hour .
thats what was so awful .
and everything !
keeping them all dangling on a string .
no , of course not , dear , if youd rather i didnt .
patrick simmons has gone through the archway into the small room where letty blacklock has had the drinks put .
she changed the subject abruptly again , it seemed .
it was to franklin clarke that she spoke and she came right up to him and , with a hand on his arm , waited for his answer .
pleased to have seen you , said miss greenshaw graciously .
my discomfiture seemed to amuse her .
snapped her father .
rice who interviews the manager and takes charge of the affair .
patrick redfern said : ill stay .
because were happy ?
you will remember , miss beddingfeld , that by that sin fell the angels , etc .
she was such a pretty little girl .
destructive little devil , he thought with faint amusement .
he penetrated to the dining room .
no , im going straight on .
_num_ ' do i understand , sir , that you are a friend of- er - miss saintclair ' s ?
im afraid not , said miss marple in a rather doubtful voice .
for a moment conway jeffersons eyes twinkled .
well , the result was very curious and suggestive .
surely the door had opened .
schedule a , of course .
whats the answer ?
they found themselves in a small hall .
ive half a mind lucia backed away with a faint cry , her eyes still on richards face as though willing him to believe her .
gold draw in her breath sharply .
i like buildings with some ornament on them , some grace .
it took an infinity of time before i could wriggle the glass into such a position , wedged against the wall , that it would rub up and down on my bonds .
do some production as well as acting .
beresford ?
the bassington-ffrenches were popular locally and everything was done to spare the feelings of the widow and the brother of the dead man .
nice natures , all these girls , and a pity they were so averse to getting married .
richard baker still looked at her quizzically sometimes and she sensed his unspoken criticism , but his manner was pleasant and friendly , and he was genuinely amused by her enthusiasm .
she said : what do you think i said ?
not at all , said lord caterham coldly .
it did happen .
now i do .
lady carmichael improved slowly .
paying no attention to anybody , poirot strode at once to the study .
she doesnt , i think , attach any importance to it .
as a matter of fact i went to hurst park .
dr gerard was wiser .
she murmured , im sorry , and put it away in her bag again .
reddings time is fully accounted for up to _num_ : _num_ and haydock says positively protheroe couldnt have been shot then .
first .
think about it ?
she looked questioningly at tuppence .
but he had the impression that mrs .
thats what were going to do .
you agree to that , yes ?
really , of course , it was ursula bournes white apron he saw as she was stealing down to the summerhouse .
what a lovely creature she was .
the gay , laughing expression on his face was wiped off as though by a sponge from a slate .
because i am an old maid , perhaps .
she made the tea , you say , and took it in .
the case is complete .
eh bien , i think i know .
there was a very slight underlying satisfaction in her tone , the satisfaction of one whose gloomy prognostications have been shown to be correct .
the leg of mutton ?
if anyone was here who had no business to be here they would be more likely to run away , or to try to run away .
one doesnt like to run away , said the ruler of ramat .
a hearty meal of scones , crumpets , sandwiches and three kinds of cake .
she was startled and upset at breakfast this morning when she received a letter saying mr .
there must be a little more to it than that , said tommy .
he had a kind of hypnotic influence about that sort of thing ; he was so positive himself that he was right that you couldnt help having doubts yourself .
principal mountains , also unknown , but fairly numerous .
we agreed that i should try to find a nice preparatory school , and we settled tentatively on cheltenham , which was the largest school i could think of , for the future .
i took no notice of it .
he was saying appreciatively : a very nice piece of work , madeleine .
prestcott went on : josie was very good at calming down unpleasantnesses .
simply because strychnine has an unusually bitter taste .
and now georges peroration draws to a close .
she said quietly : you mustnt think , m .
the girl replied at once .
what does he think im made of ?
ii nobody could have been more ready to talk than donald mcneil .
it seems quite incredible to me , said maude , that timothys sisterhis own sistercan have been murdered with a hatchet !
forty-six the horses of diomedes the horses of diomedes was first published in the strand , june _num_ .
you cant help the way youre born .
drake greeted mrs .
she has been with me six months .
there is no subtlety about them .
there was a slight frown on her brow as she spoke , as though this trait in the dead mans character had at times vexed her .
the day after the murder , a letter had been received by her manager purporting to be from the dancer , in which she said that she was returning to russia on urgent private affairs and that he must deal with her broken contract as best he could .
then they shouldnt be , said the staunch daughter of the late reverend thomas carnaby .
after lunch i did some shopping , stores for christmas , and also christmas presents .
kennedy could tell us that , said gwenda .
and there are other things .
he has taken them straight from the pages of a german spy story .
miss taylor kept by his side , and resumed her catechism .
gentleman waiting for you upstairs .
she dont like it at home .
softly , she touched the top of his head with her fingers .
they put up with things .
practically from the time you were children together ?
shes not a bad sort .
snake charmers , they say , are born , not made .
as a matter of fact , sir , said mrs .
miss johnson shot a glance at miss bulstrode and back again .
these elderly men are inclined to be pigheaded .
lady cynthia greeted the newcomers with a wave of the latest thing in parasols .
that womans the biggest gossip in the village !
that was when he painted the picture of it .
thanks , i said .
and later we had his somewhat incredible story of the letter from sir bartholomew strange and the evidence of miss wills as to his having a newspaper cutting on the subject of nicotine poisoning in his possession .
my brain will begin to function shortly , i expect .
im going farther than that , said reilly .
what on earth should she have brought a hatpin down to sunningdale for ?
sometimes , when ive read a bit of history , i think mary queen of scots must have been a bit like her .
franklin i should call in if i had influenza , but i had to pay tribute to a kind of white-hot sincerity and a very real force in the man .
her sobs shook the table .
ive been trying to get it accurate , said mrs .
go on about waterloo .
youre always steve .
flowers had been put recently on the grave .
everybody was so agog and curious .
why , if that isnt too bad , captain marshall .
afraid she might have to give evidence or something like that .
iris hesitated , standing by the desk .
well , said race as he poured himself out a cup of coffee , weve got two definite leads .
and what did it say ?
ill kill you first .
jimmy frowned deeply as he tried to see where this led .
and how had he tampered with it ?
gerda described it at length .
reddings house once or twice , but hed say that was to speak to his mother .
look at the vista down from here , poirot .
i will follow .
just take anything essential .
the young man lowered his eyes .
im afraid she is going to know all about it .
she was in love with a young man called bywaters who came off a ship and he went down a different street after the theatre and stabbed him in the back .
but you see , here comes the crux of the matter .
so it is , she said .
let me pass , please .
this isnt the sort of place youd get a body !
whenever he retired he meant to go there .
miss marple sat watching her .
ten minutes later , they were sitting downstairs in the comfortable kitchen being introduced to curtis , a rather gruff-looking , grey-haired old man , and being regaled with strong tea , bread and butter , devonshire cream and hard-boiled eggs .
as m .
i came out of my door and stood listening .
no , it wasnt only that .
anyone can wear a dressing gown .
for , warm and delightful , was a secret knowledge of superiority .
ive heard the wildest stories .
she and elinor cleared up the pantry .
it was at that moment that he caught sight of a funicular railway .
i think timothys mind might be set at rest if you were here to reassure him .
i might be dangerously ill .
erskine to whom lily kimble had written ?
staverleys a mere village .
legal formalities can always be delayed .
quickly i rise from my table and go to stand by cerberus .
but as poirot maintained an inexorable silence , he capitulated .
if a lampshade caught fire she was rescued from a burning building at the hazard of her life .
this is justeryour own idea ?
the stockbroker murmured : i wonder .
why , yes , sir , sometimes , sir .
to my surprise , he did not examine them , merely remarking approvingly as he relocked the desk : decidedly , he is a man of method , this mr .
greenholtzs officeand there wont be any edward .
the brain worknot the dangerous labourfor him .
you were saying that you had bought the cup from the marchese di san veratrino ?
youll get results , im sure .
why did terence stare at him in that slow , interested way ?
it seems most absurd .
that is perhaps understandableif it were a member of her own family who placed that thread there !
you can send for him if you likebut i should prefer that you did not .
robinson here was called in .
there was nothing else on the bottom shelf .
and its beautifully furnished !
and now can i get you a drink , mrs .
oh , well he was !
you mean , said michael , that your refugees when they come here will not be able to put their past sufferings completely behind them ?
stop the car .
i cant depend on themwhen she tells me to do thingsi do them !
then she opened her lips and said something that startled me to the core .
it was a shock to all of us , said maude abernethie .
gladys narracott hesitated a minute .
in fact , for a moment i meditated running after the young man and informing him that my father had changed his mind and would send the articles in question .
the place was almost perfectly planned .
the old man looked up at him , nodded , then motioned him to a chair .
i threw on a bathrobe and hurried in .
nor did i , said one of the girls .
at last she said quietly : i dont know how you know but yes , you are right .
roberts had counted on his doing that .
well be the judge of that , said kemp pleasantly .
such a request was clearly unusual .
his eyes were half open and sightless .
mary asked .
it was mss _num_ .
cant you ever leave murder alone , woman ?
is her husband terribly upset ?
it was one of his more ostentatious cards .
satterthwaite knew about him .
the solicitor endeavoured to hide his disappointment with a wave of the hand .
scotland yard was inclined to jeer at first , but they have been forced to admit that m .
julian is just frantic with rage that he cant be here , said mrs .
he would say so , i remarked bitterly .
dont they realize that the inhabitants of the globe are busy committing suicide ?
a charming house and she herself is a delightful woman in spite of being very much of an invalid .
we dont want roger bassington-ffrench for abduction .
cigarette-holder (ivory) .
you are early .
the only trouble was she was highly averse to going anywhere where there was a child and a nurse .
i took the name of parker and came to this island , which i knew of old .
cornelia gasped out : isnt this just awful ?
despite the utmost endeavours of the police , georges conneau was never traced .
is theresomething more , sir ?
i havent found out a thing more !
ye-es , said norman doubtfully .
then , as a speculation , he had built six small bungalows , each in its quarter acre of ground , along the lane .
here is the analysts report proving beyond a doubt that a narcotic was present .
and then he had put forward the , to veronica , amazing suggestion that she should turn down the hollywood offer and marry him and settle down in london .
or at least it is simple to one of my ability .
said japp affectionately .
thenthen i think id be happy again .
it is a weak spot on which you put your finger .
the old woman tossed her head scornfully .
if i shoot a lion i shant give you the skinafter the base way youve deserted me .
that did not seem to be known to those in the old manor house .
such a thing would have offended her sense of fitness .
he follows her down here , stays somewhere in the neighbourhood , comes over to the island , does her in .
the bawdy twinkle came into her eye again .
also selfish .
i expect this is just a chance resemblance .
i am always interested in murder , lord edgware .
delafontaine had presumably lived in london .
miss brewis was probably prejudiced .
but later i walked along the stream and miss king was there .
youve got to find another in a hurry , and thats not an easy job .
miss amory can tell you much more about this house than i can , lucia told dr carelli .
hes not likely to recognize you .
he said he would not pretend that it had been anything but a bit of most marvellous luck for him .
is that your idea of seeing the world ?
and theyve done wonders in restoring it .
he asked in a puzzled way .
there was no air of poised competence about her , nor indeed was there ever likely to be .
i am terribly afraid .
after everyone except me had slept soundly for at least an houri used to rock myself cautiously in the rocking-chairwe would have a game of schoolmaster .
someone is considered to be harmful to civilization and is removed on that account .
she opened it at the page showing the most recent entries .
id never kill anybody .
i could see that he was not entirely taken in by my pretences of belief in the occult .
eastwood assured her .
always bringing up sticks of celery and early peas and things like that .
nothing else seems to pass the time away so quick .
he found it difficult to remember exactly .
to gentle people only .
but ursula shook her head energetically .
apparently thats got to be done .
last man in the world youd expect to be murderedand murder is what it looks like .
no , hardly at allif you know what i mean .
nursery rhyme remembered from my childhood .
dont have nought to do with gipsys acre .
it is the common weed that thrives in the wintry air , but it is not to be prized higher on that account .
then they drew apart again , and deirdre , conscious as she put it of the idiocy of the question , said : then youre not dead ?
it comes none the less surely to a woman because she is the wife of a respectable dentist in a country town !
i thought that poirot was favourably impressed by her .
galling , isnt it ?
she used to have one day off a week , you know , and go to london , and thats where she used to take the things , whatever they were .
nadine boynton shifted wearily in her chair .
and still he excused himself and tried to explain away that which a child might have seen in its naked truth .
a printed card and a printed sheet of notepaper are simple matters to obtain , and he is willing to pay _num_ and a year ' s house rem to assure the success of his plan .
she could hear a car coming and if she kept herself flattened into a little ravine which had eroded down the side of the hillock , she could get some idea of who was in the car .
about eleven oclock in the morning .
she continued to move her neck gingerly .
motives are very curious things .
henry just thought he wore the wrong shoes .
well , you just dont know nowadays .
he had , as he grew older , what i might call a churchmans facenot a monks face , certainly not a visionarysthe kind of churchman versed in ecclesiastical practices and able to acquit himself well at the council of trentand to be quite sound on the exact number of angels able to dance on the point of a needle .
vera laughed .
but bill has been round to see me with the most amazing story you ever heard .
do you mean the house was supposed to be insanitary , or something ?
another man drifted up , a fair young man wearing an old etonian tie .
aime went on : its a difficult position for her , naturally .
were investigating mrs .
ive got you your information re despard .
colonel monckton stared at the artist with the detached interest he might have accorded to a new species of jellyfish .
this , i think , must have been written not long after a cause celebre which occurred in france .
the dear fellow isnt perhaps very bright , i said thoughtfully .
he wasdead .
i will leave provision for him , to do for him everything that can be done .
perhaps you have already married her ?
well , she could have pulled it till all was blue .
my watch and the clock in the car were exactly synchronized .
miss cram , by the way , had been cleared of all complicity .
now there are some things i want to knowbut i do not wish to seem to want to know them .
i will show her that i am not a child .
, the eminent psychologist .
then he placed it on one side and proceeded to the next envelope in the pile .
his mind went on to mrs .
said the doctor , surprised .
jefferson , for instanceeveryone liked her .
so very rebelliously , twice a week , i was called for by a suitable young woman (since girls did not go about alone in paris) and taken by metro or bus to an atelier somewhere near the flower-market .
five hundred to miss carroll .
with a sigh of satisfaction he unscrewed the bottle of beer .
ill certainly have something to say to her .
but it would be all in a good cause , so to speak .
no matteronlyverity .
he and i go to picture shows a good deal together .
they had been playing a single at tennis against each other and were sitting afterwards sipping iced drinks .
this system was , i think , a good one ; it resulted , certainly , in a high percentage of happy marriages .
but what could you see in me ?
thank you very much , miss zielinsky .
here , packed in unceremoniously , were two pairs of skis , a pair of sculls mounted , ten or twelve hippopotamus tusks , rods and lines and various fishing tackle including a book of flies , a bag of golf clubs , a tennis racket , an elephants foot stuffed and mounted and a tiger skin .
said her father .
colonel melchett looked as though he were about to return a short answer , but superintendent harper intervened .
she asked , i cant believe it somehow .
amyas and i love each otheryouve seen that clearly enough .
then , pressing the bell , he remarked to me , she lies , that mademoiselle collins .
then she heard a rustle close by her and glanced up sharply to see mrs .
that man is grossly inaccurate .
there were waves in the air of feelinga strong electrical current ofwhat was it ?
oh , i suppose i ' d better just have a look in this cupboard under the stairs .
take the diamond out and say what you said last night .
it had passed out the other side and had evidently struck a mirror hanging on the left-hand wall , since this was shivered .
such a quick glancejust a flash .
and , anyway , we shall soon find out , said donovan cheerfully , as he hauled on the rope .
betterton ?
did they quarrel that night ?
may i accompany you , m .
oh , yes , there was a certain physical peculiaritywell , i will not dwell on the subject .
two at least who are goingwherever they are going .
he doesnt have any old pals to staynothing of that kind .
legge was not pleased about it , perhaps ?
she wanted me to come down here .
rye is the grain itself .
its going to be a grand christmas !
she thinks he wants to get henry to the grange as a patientwell , thats a very natural wish for a doctor to have .
elsie shivered .
she added in the hope of making a diversion , i wonder where mr .
again he smiled in his agreeable fashion .
listen here , will you ?
you had a car accident , i hear ?
so fiercely and defensively did he say it , that mr .
hes in the inner office , i think .
it must have been hard to do your shopping .
she observed with a smile that her friend of the mink coat was solving the possible awkwardness of the dinner problem in her own way .
it might have been wiser , mrs .
inspector neele formed a favourable picture of miss dove .
send him away .
youve been so kind and soso calm .
hardly a member of my staff , objected miss bulstrode .
or , perhaps , one might say almost professional .
poirot apologized handsomely .
his wife sighed : ' tony never makes pretty speeches - do you , my lamb ?
welli was in the darkroom most of the time .
as though he might do - anything !
i am all wrong .
after a gap of more than twenty-five years by the pricking of my thumbs was the next-to-last adventure for the pair .
it is my business to know things , he explained .
thats the man who lives at the canal house .
i do think the hours before breakfast should be sacred .
i cut pictures out of old illustrated magazines and pasted them into scrap-books made of brown paper .
gave me some specially good feeds , too .
belling , she exclaimed .
_num_ but our patience was rewarded at last .
he came into the church when he was dying , for sanctuary .
my surmise was no new one to himit had passed through his brain also , i could see .
is that satisfactory ?
very upset and anxious to see you .
she said : chief-inspector craddock ?
what have the hortons to do with it ?
so it did , my friend .
there was the vicar and doctor sandfords wife .
i might be a reporter , her daughters fianc , or an obscure hanger-on of the police force , or even an undertakerto magda leonides they would one and all come under the general heading of audience .
he was seated in the shadow of the rock , so that i could not see his face , but the menace in his voice was unpleasant .
yes , ive heard of that .
those cats , said dick , and shuddered .
the colour slowly drained from her face .
frenchmen are always polite , said miss henderson there was the nuance of a question in her voice .
and she could always say shed been with me there and that we hadnt left the place .
not very fashionable the way he wore it , but it suited him , sir , if you know what i mean .
i was willingit was what i believed myself , what surely everyone believed .
then , when i found from whos who that young warrenders employer , sir kenneth thomson , was a stamp collector , my suspicion developed , and just now , when he had the impertinence to pocket the envelope under my nose , i felt it was a certainty .
freckles and a yorkshire accent , said mrs .
he realized that heredity had been too strong for her .
mirelle was panting , and her eyes , half defiant , half frightened , went from the face of one man to the other .
it was confirmation of all his vague surmises and forebodings .
too much nice feeling , i suppose .
lees a very nice lady .
his tone held boyish awe and astonishment .
thats very interesting , miss harris .
they can verify the marriage by looking up old records in somerset house .
such wonderful shops .
thats the same thing , isnt it ?
nobodys going to take my gun away from me .
and i sent ellis over to fetch it .
and we can certainly control our actions .
tom betterton had believed that she had been sent to get him out of here as he had put it .
oh , thank you , m .
she made a detour through the garden to ask betty sprot what she would like as a present from london .
theres not many men could put in the work on it that i do .
one had to face itshe was startled by mr .
no , i cant say it did .
you see , my mother lives at gilling , where he used to be vicar .
she was an earnest believer in womans intuition .
there was a ladder against the window and a man was fumbling with the window catch .
did he profit in a monetary sense by his wifes death ?
you place yourself in my hands .
' he bent over and just touched it with a finger-tip .
it is pleasant there .
miss marple came to the window , halted apologetically , and asked for griselda .
van snyders shrill protests , he opened the large wardrobe trunk and rummaged swiftly in the interior .
but tonight i was reminded of my first meal therewhen mrs .
who could have written this letter ?
i tell you of my own knowledge that it is never finished with a murderer .
his eyes said a number of things while he was doing it .
but not like this !
it was after nofret came that satipys tongue finally goaded yahmose beyond endurance .
impossible , said marie , impossible that she should enact such a role .
broadribb who was , apparently , the senior partner .
some ladies do , you know .
in my excited state , it simply sounded to me like a cannon going off .
i dare say , said mrs .
suddenly my eyes were held in glad and incredulous surprise .
she thought to herself with rising vexation : whats the old darling up to ?
edmundson was a tall fair young man , very correctly dressed with manners to match , and a general air of quiet disapproval .
oliver had expected , it was certainly not that .
in one , the captain had a beard and in the other he had a red face and a scar on his chin .
miss wills was not looking at him .
then you see , i saw i saw a light there .
mr rhodes , who is writing a book on prehistoric flints , settled down to work in the adjoining room .
according to medical evidence , it could only have been swallowed a few minutes previous to death .
he was quite ordinaryjust like anyone else .
i know , said miss marple .
it was a horrifying thing to happen .
both he and evesham were much of the same typehonest upright kindly men with no great pretensions to brains .
then i was travelling by train and i saw a girl .
she remained even after the dancing had started .
he was a tall soldierly looking man .
really , teething trouble !
he wasnt all bad , im sure he wasnt all bad .
i know it sounds unbelievable to you , inspector , he said , but honestly neither marina nor i have any idea about this business .
jefferson about ?
if olga had been less greedy , mr .
ive got the right to have my solicitor present before i say a word .
thats all i ask .
i should much like to meet that man .
i know , mrs .
now it seems hed only got that scar a year or two ago and heres me swearing he had it when he left me years ago and thats perjury and i might go to prison for it .
with no real suspicion of anything being amiss , nevertheless newman had wondered .
strangers arriving there to stay would stick out a mile .
then there were all the household implements , brushes and dustpans , brooms and pails and kitchen saucepans .
she was a neurotic , highly-strung type .
slowly hercule poirot shook his head .
hearn said , his face flushing slightly : whats yours , sir ?
it wasnt wasted , mr .
i must speak to aristide .
he dashed out into the hall .
said gwenda , her mind flying to arithmetic .
you wish to believe he committed the crime .
she said sharply and venomously , youve always been against me , nadine .
tommy considered .
an imperious wave of his hand drove us all to the door .
just went along sometimes to the pub on a saturday night , but none of these murders took place on a saturday night , so there wasnt anything in that .
no , she could hardly do that , not after all the trouble she had taken .
who it was who put him up to it , i mean .
i dont want to reflect .
morganthal , she had advised divorce and suggested the exact amount of alimony .
homicidal mania , said mr .
he just counted , if you know what i mean .
you paid the full penaltyand mores the pity theyve given it up , so mr .
no , cut out all that kind of stuff .
thats the case against ellsworthy !
no , he is not a wing-commander .
sarah turned her head sharply .
graham took her hand .
what did i stopped , rather horrified at myself .
the first thing i did when i arrived , of course , was to size them all up and assess , as it were , possibilities .
on the other hand , men dont really appreciate women who are nice to them all the time .
he took a moment or two turning over things in his mind .
if her child died so should the children of other women .
what is the matter with him ?
a frown creased his forehead .
it will be a satisfaction .
she learned then that courage is the resolution to face the unforeseenand she had not got that courage .
but , really , im beginning to be afraid we cant afford even this room much longer .
he asked excitedly .
miss anne , you are very much a child still .
ive got my reputation with the police here to consider .
listen , he gripped her arm .
he said : and all the former have frosted glass windows , and one does not play billiards on a fine morning .
i said , rather disappointed .
but it was he who told suzanne all about the colonel and how he had been in paris trying to get on his track .
they are companions because they are fit for nothing better .
yes , perhaps , she considered .
he said : thats not to say that they didnt think me an old fool !
my fathers death was a great shock to her .
then this morning i heard that girl screaming and leach stopped him .
i outgrew nursies condemnation of cards as the devils picture books , but no cards on sundays was a rule of the house , and in after years when playing bridge on a sunday i never quite threw off a feeling of wickedness .
ellis obtains this post with false credentials .
browns plan that we are to lead him .
not at the moment , but ill bear you in mind , son .
because it wasnt miss blacklock who was standing there with the gun ?
you didnt see him yesterday , did you , mrs .
all the lights were extinguished except one reading lamp by her bed .
i should be most interested .
you , too , have not been faithful to me since our marriage .
he collided with a screen , said i beg your pardon to it in a flustered manner , and went out of the room .
there are times , madame , when pride and dignitythey go by the board !
im really feeling quite myself again by now .
do show me if it is possible !
actually were thinking of having a show of him here in about four or five months time .
but i wondered ifsince thenoh !
but caroline was not in a cross-questioning mood .
i sat there .
i have not seen her since she was fifteen years old .
that is the unfortunate part of the case .
oh , it is difficult .
oh , hes clever and intellectual and all that , i dare say .
remember him in the witness-box .
and she died ?
dust lay about rather noticeably , and my sensitive friend gave a characteristic grimace as he ran his finger round a rectangular mark on a table near the window .
antheas all right .
its a motif from an opera , said ketelly .
at the end she nodded her head .
rosamund added complacently : ive always known it was george .
any excuse to arrange for the police to come so that you shall see them .
and if you know the right peoplei dont mean i know them now , but i can get to know them through people i do knowthen i think i could perhaps get a short list .
well , he said , consulting his notebook .
should say myselfvery unlikely .
really , i mean it .
of course there were lots of people by that time , staring , you know .
you did not read the daily papers , the account of this family that was given in the newspapers .
she took it home with her .
but there now , you know her , of course !
did your wife receive a letter from mr .
he held the door open and bryant and poirot passed through , followed by the suspicious glance of the rest of the company .
is that why you never talked about them ?
she went on : its partly , i think , from having been the second of the family .
im thinking that the man is safe somewherequite safe .
and i didnt feel it at first .
he takes a dim view .
just like a child .
and the pinecones on the fire .
' _num_ leonie responded promptly .
yes , she added , softly , meditatively .
he was in a condition of pessimism when one more thing that was unsatisfactory actually afforded him a kind of grim satisfaction .
dont be kind .
always asking my husband about the chemical processes for treating the metal objects and helping miss johnson to mend pottery .
she was lying on the bed , asleep or restingsomeone opens the door , she looks up , rises to her feet and he struck her down , finished the doctor .
look at it this way : babbingtons murderedyes , murderedim not going to hedge , or mince termsmurdered one evening in my house .
and yet its only just come to me .
old babbington , for instance , went on sir charles , he had a curiously vague personality .
he had been seen talking to the man but we had only his word for what they had been talking about .
continuez toujours .
this happened in a private house which makes it different , but perhaps not so different as all that .
real evidence is usually vague and unsatisfactory .
you dont know , i said , howhow brave she is .
for luncheon .
she took a key from her pocket .
she walked on a few steps , and mr .
taken into the car , going up in the elevator of the hotel to the eighteenth floor .
one of the group interposed the information that the lady was laughing and waving her hand .
we wont call it that , i said sharply .
the principal relaxation of her early married life had been talking to the girland even when the girl had been multiplied by three , conversation with her domestic staff had still been the principal distraction of lady cootes day .
but now its different .
he went out , impressed as he always was impressed , by miss pebmarshs personality .
pagett winced .
what about the colonies ?
whether somebody else had killed them or whether theyd been assassinated or something , or whether they killed each other .
he suggested my coming !
then lewis came along with his passionate enthusiasm about constructive training for juvenile delinquents .
yesyesperhaps youre right .
oh , because said ellie .
i was in a hotel at eastbourne .
here is another , said katherine .
our own impressions and ideas are of no practical use .
we have here , you see , two conflicting statements .
or mrs .
like that queen in historyeleanor of something , that followed the clue to fair rosamunds bower and offered her the choice of a dagger or a cup of poison .

a faint flush flitted over the girls face , as julius stepped forward and took her hand .
there had also been cautious letters .
nearly the whole of sir arthurs income goes to keeping it up .
i was standing with my wifenear a centre table with some flowers on it .
he went down on his knees and scrutinized the floor inch by inch .
starkwedder looked at her , as though trying to make her out .
i met him at a party and i fell for himi knew id got to have him a travestya grotesque travesty but and all my fortunes at thy foot ill lay and follow thee , my lord , throughout the world .
the things she used to imagine and the states she used to get into !
he showed no particular emotion .
dont lets forget to call at the doctors on our way home .
whether somebody was paying her to say the things she did ?
thats very nice , im sure , said father .
a nun who came to the house on the day that richard abernethie died .
he had taken his chance .
this wasnt his suit .
the carmanic murmured poirot .
blake stared .
said tuppence , slightly surprised .
darling , i do know what im talking about !
ii tried to keep him away from the house .
i never have been .
' ' he never went out to theatres .
its the old crippen touch again .
but he is a wonderful mana great teacher .
im sure i never did anything of the kind !
so that was it , she said .
you see , ive kept saying to myself as perhaps i ought to tell .
but anyway well meet again then .
she had refused the rendezvous .
to begin with , m .
women dont go and slit a mans throat in cold blood .
they were driving through the outskirts of london .
it appeared to be a rude kind of map .
they gave a soft mellow light , hardly strong enough even to read by .
but whyhowwhy should you think ?
it would make me feel , i thought , that i was in the country .
she said to lawrence .
it was as though she withdrew into a shell .
in fact , im sure he didnt .
theyre always vain as hell , these people !
this is my wife , detective inspector hardcastle .
only because i put it into your head .
he had failed to assess the value of what he seemed , for one brief moment , to have seen .
they were silent a minute or two digesting the news .
betterton , now dont get upset .
exclaimed costello .
be something in my line .
one of these people was a murderer !
its a good view of the hills .
i really do .
shes the kind of woman that to my mind is absolutely worthless !
satterthwaite answered complacently .
henet began to sob .
what do they know ?
then ill make a start here , in your sitting room .
dear , dear , she exclaimed , and so weve got a visitor , have we ?
find out the state of his finances .
oldfield died .
and that , hastings is why i am afraid !
but shes the one whos taking the risk , i muttered .
jane said , ah !
it hadnt mattered when it was jacko .
and , suddenly toppling forward , she fainted heavily on m .
the next person on inspector sharpes list was leonard bateson .
leckie paused .
for all they know i might be busy .
revolving these and sundry other matters in my mind , i went mechanically on my round .
what do you meanthe first one ?
it was their day out .
she sounded all in .
hardcastle wondered if he only fancied that he saw sudden apprehension come into her eyes .
yes , sir , mr .
already he dictates our lives to us completely .
then comes the beat of drums from afar , and tosca flings herself wearily down on the sofa .
the seats of the chairs did not , as in so many modern high-priced armchairs , stop halfway between the thigh and the knee , thereby inflicting agony on those suffering from arthritis and sciatica ; and they were not all of a pattern .
that gives em rubber .
i cant see how he could have had any alibi at all if he spent his time first at regent gate doing a murder and then with carlotta adams .
plots come to me at such odd moments : when i am walking along a street , or examining a hat-shop with particular interest , suddenly a splendid idea comes into my head , and i think , now that would be a neat way of covering up the crime so that nobody would see the point .
and the result ?
but i didnt hear anything of that kind when we were there .
its built back to back , you see .
do you remember whom she married ?
thats very high , said the v .
perhaps satipy had followed yahmose up to the tomb to harangue further ?
there is one person we mustnt forgetand that is hannah .
were they fond of each other , those two sisters ?
bouc grudgingly .
but the friendliness of mr .
yes , she said , there will be a lot of changes here now , i expect .
the condition of the room was clear proof of this statement .
an elderly woman with red eyes opened the door to them when they arrived at thurnly grange .
and i dont know which !
weve no right to anythinganything at all .
but i cant quite see why she went to you .
she said : youre quite right .
lansquenet would have wished you to take a good tea .
that fellow browne ?
she belonged to a young , bright , go-ahead set in londona set that had freak parties and occasionally ended up in the police courts .
poirot nodded to japp .
but dont you think youre being rather precipitate ?
i put the first of them in your drawerafter shooting old west with itwhat are you looking at over my head ?
bantry , no , i suppose we oughtnt to then she took pity on them , buti dont think anyone would know if we have one peep .
dr giles , id be obliged if youd go down and send up the housekeeper .
lydias voice came like a fluttering whisper : who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him ?
he nodded cheerfully .
what were we talking about ?
the jeweller arrived just before dinner with a car full of other tourists .
and shes always been very good to us .
' poirot listened sympathetically .
it is sad and very cruel if she dies , said miss marple .
yes , but attendez .
i mean that though , to take an instance , her atrocity stories have grown and grown until every kind of unpleasant story that has ever appeared in print has happened to her or her relations personally , she did have a bad shock initially and did see one , at least , of her relations killed .
i regarded it as closely as i could , but could see nothing unusual about it .
in the study were a stalwart inspector and the police surgeon .
hed got it into his head that id quarrelled with johnwhich is true in a way though not in the way he meant .
i think , thought tuppence , i think perhaps shes dead .
its not professional .
but the essential point on which the story turns is the same , said poirot .
gwenda went back into the house smiling a little .
living alone , with no one to consult or to talk to , one might easily become melodramatic and imagine things which had no foundation in fact .
thats the worshipper .
but there we are .
ackroyd stared blankly at me as though he hardly understood .
ill go up .
' ' gaspers .
hadnt we better go on ?
superintendent battle and inspector leach had been absent today , and that , too , was a relief .
the lawyer fancied so .
a year and a half .
there are things that are preferable to academic distinctions , said dermot .
let me wear them till dinnertime , will you , darling ?
does that strike you as the sense , mademoiselle ?
poirot was consulting his enormous watch .
im going to have a baby .
stealing a glance at the line of her profile , at the long beautiful hands , he wondered .
well , i know what i suppose anyone would know who was acquainted with your family .
only it hadnt worked out quite the way it was supposed to do for these children were not the children that he and rachel would have had .
good-bye , and god bless you .
